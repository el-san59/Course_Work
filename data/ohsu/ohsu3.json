  ".W": "Atlanto-axial rotatory fixation is one of a spectrum of rotatory abnormalities of the atlanto-axial joint. Rotatory fixation without anterior displacement of the atlas (Type I) has been reported in only a few cases in which there has been a prolonged interval between injury and diagnosis. The majority of these cases eventually required cervical fusion for persistent deformity or instability. Two cases are presented in which this diagnosis was made early with the aid of rotated odontoid radiographs, tomography and computerised axial tomography. Treatment by a short period of halter traction achieved reduction and early return of function. The authors conclude that early recognition and treatment of this rare condition may prevent the subsequent deformity and instability for which cervical fusion has been required.\r"

We have tried to determine if differences in neurological response could be detected and measured clinically, and have compared the threshold of detection of vibratory sensation in 20 girls with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with that in 20 clinically normal age-matched controls. A highly significant reduction of the threshold of detection of vibration was seen in the scoliotic group compared to the controls (p less than 0.001). Curve magnitude did not correlate with this threshold for either the upper (r = 0.172) or lower extremity (r = 0.126). Significant asymmetry between right- and left-sided thresholds to vibration was demonstrated in the scoliotic group. Our study supports the concept that an aberration in the function of the posterior column pathway of the cord may be of primary importance in the aetiology of idiopathic scoliosis. A clinically practical test to measure this function is presented.\r"

Fourteen patients were studied after single-level chemonucleolysis and the results compared with a control group of 17 discs in six patients who had diagnostic discography without enzyme insertion. A consistent pattern of gradual loss of signal from the nucleus pulposus culminating in complete loss of nuclear signal was seen in all cases after chemonucleolysis. Chymopapain therefore produced MRI changes analogous with premature gross disc degeneration. The rate at which this occurred varied; complete loss of signal took at least six weeks. Transitory minor end-plate changes were present in five patients, probably representing a mild chemical discitis. No similar changes were seen in the discography group.\r"

The Baumann angle was also measured after reduction of supracondylar fractures of the humerus and was found to correlate well with the final carrying angle measured at follow-up. There was no significant difference between the Baumann angle after reduction and that measured at follow-up; and it is suggested that this angle after reduction can be reliably used to predict accurately the final carrying angle.\r"

In all, 39 car occupants suffered femoral shaft fracture, with an incidence of 1.7% and 0.8% for front and rear seat occupants respectively. Of these, 31 had associated injuries to other regions of the body; these were the cause of 13 of the 14 deaths in this group. Associated injuries were more severe in car occupants who were not wearing seat belts but the incidence of femoral fracture was not significantly different. The mean velocity change (delta-V) causing femoral fracture was 26 mph (42 km/h) and there was a higher incidence of femoral shaft fracture when delta-V was over 30 mph. Estimates of forces needed to cause fracture were higher than those found in cadaver studies. The time to union of femoral fractures did not correlate with the severity of the crash but was longer (mean 19 weeks) than the average for other femoral fractures.\r"

Our findings support the possibility that mechanical loosening is initiated by thermal injury during polymerisation of the cement; the less frequent migration of the metallic femoral component compared with the polyethylene acetabular component may be because the metal acts as a heat sink. Standard radiographs were inadequate for assessment of early mechanical loosening, whereas RSA could reveal migration within four months of the arthroplasty.\r"

Using actuarial methods, the probability of the prosthesis remaining in situ after six years was calculated. In osteoarthritis this probability ranged from 65% for hinged prostheses to 90% for medial compartment prostheses. Two-and three-compartment prostheses produced intermediate results with 87% survival. In rheumatoid arthritis the probability varied from 72% for medial compartment prostheses to 90% for two- and three-compartment prostheses. The main reason for failure was loosening of the components, the second most common was infection. The probability of revision for infection by six years was 2% in osteoarthritis and 3% in rheumatoid arthritis. Most revisions were to a three-compartment prosthesis. Knee fusion at primary revision was required in 2% of the cases at six years.\r"

The addition of an integral skin flap to a vascularised fibular graft makes reconstruction of bone defects with significant skin loss possible, and the technique for designing and raising such a flap is presented. The advantages of this transfer over other microvascular osteocutaneous flaps are the available length of straight cortical bone, the large thin skin flap, the good diameter of the vascular pedicle and the fact that dissection is carried out under a tourniquet.\r"

Further research into this and Perthes' disease should follow the premise that they are two different diseases without any aetiological connection.\r"

Study of the cleavage lines around the knee demonstrated that the medial parapatellar incision lies parallel to the lines, whilst the anterior midline incision lies perpendicular to them. In addition, the medial parapatellar wound was found to be subjected to significantly less tension during flexion; after arthroplasty it can be expected to heal faster and to be less liable to disruption during early mobilisation.\r"

We prepared a basement membrane matrix from autogenous striated muscle, used it to repair the sciatic nerve in rats, then investigated the results by histology and electrophysiology. When treated grafts were coaxially aligned with the nerve fascicles functional recovery appeared within 30 days, with good growth of axons into the distal nerve. Grafts with myotubes at right angles to the nerve fascicles supported nerve regeneration but at a slower rate. Grafts of coaxially aligned but untreated muscle allowed axon penetration only through naturally degenerated muscle fibres, with minimal axon penetration of the distal nerve. It is concluded that in the rat a treated graft with correctly orientated empty myotubes can facilitate and guide the regeneration of peripheral nerve after injury and so lead to recolonisation of the distal stump with functional recovery.\r"

We have observed seven patients with this deformity for an average of six years from initial examination at 20 days to 3.5 years. Arthrography showed that the configuration of the ankle was apparently normal in patients under 10 months of age and that a ball-and-socket joint develops by four to five years of age, possibly in compensation for the loss of inversion and eversion caused by tarsal coalition. Ball-and-socket joint is therefore probably not congenital, but is an acquired deformity secondary to various pre-existing congenital conditions.\r"

Three of the patients were men and twelve were women. They ranged in age from 9 to 75 years. Their symptoms were chest pain, dyspnea, cough, palpitation and syncope. Definite diagnosis was confirmed by echo- and cineangiocardiography. There were 14 benign tumors consisting of 13 myxomas, one leiomyoma and one malignant myxosarcoma. The left atrium was the most common chamber involved (12 instances), followed by the right atrium (3). Surgery was performed in all cases under cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia and cold crystalloid cardioplegia. Tumors were removed en bloc at the base with their attachment to the atrial septum or free wall in all cases. Three patients underwent concomitant mitral annuloplasty or mitral commissurotomy. Two cases with left atrial myxoma died postoperatively: one case associated with mitral annuloplasty died of congestive heart failure due to newly developed chordal rupture two months after surgery, and the other died of congestive heart failure 13 months after the first operation. Re-excision for recurrence of the myxosarcoma in the left atrium was performed in the latter case as a second surgical procedure. The remaining 13 cases with benign tumors are doing well and are without recurrence. From these favorable results, surgical intervention should be recommended prior to the occurrence of heart failure and severe complications such as coronary or peripheral embolism whenever cardiac tumors are detected by non-invasive echocardiography and cineangiocardiography.\r"

Eighty-one (90%) did not require blood transfusion in the immediate postoperative period; nine patients received 16 units of blood, 6 of whom bled excessively; 2 were re-explored. Twelve had post-operative haemoglobins below 8.5 G/dl during their stay. They were transfused a total of 28 units of blood before discharge. Post-operative blood loss in the 9 transfused early averaged 894 +/- 176 ml (SEM). Loss from the not transfused patients averaged 481 +/- 18 ml (p less than 0.001). Patients transfused later had a mean loss of 510 +/- 36 ml (P NS). Sixty-nine patients were not transfused. Haemoglobin on the first post-operative day was 11.3 +/- 1.3 G/dl (SD). This declined to 10.2 +/- 1.2 G/dl on the fifth day. Discharge haemoglobin was 10.5 +/- 1.2 G/dl. Two patients died, one of myocardial infarction on the third day and the other of pancreatitis on the fourth. Both had had early blood transfusion. Haemoglobins were above 10 G/dl. Of the 69 untransfused patients 17% had supraventricular arrhythmias. Ten percent had serous wound discharges; 3 were infected. There were no sternal dehiscences. It is concluded that bank blood transfusion with its attendant hazards and expense is easily avoidable in most patients. This saving of resources will increase the availability of blood and rare groups for surgery.\r"

Early exploration, wide fasciotomies, use of temporary intraluminal shunts during the bone fixation procedures (usually by internal plates), definitive venous and arterial repair after limb stabilization was achieved and frequent use of intraoperative angiography were the predominant factors in the treatment and outcome in these complex injuries. All eight limbs with closed fractures and/or dislocations were preserved, as well as 17 of 19 (89%) of the limbs with open or exposed skeletal injuries, resulting in a limb salvage rate of 92.6%.\r"

Thirty-four patent aneurysms presented with either ischaemic ulceration or claudication due to tibial artery disease or were asymptomatic with normal distal pulses. Thrombosis made reconstruction difficult and at times required a femoro-tibial graft. In others reconstruction was not possible leading to amputation either as primary treatment or following failed revascularization. In patent aneurysms one or more tibial arteries were frequently occluded. It is postulated that obliterative atheromatous disease of the tibial vessels and the slow flow through the aneurysmal vessels is responsible for the high incidence of thrombosis, poor graft patency and a high amputation rate.\r"

Autogenous saphenous vein was absent or inadequate in all patients. Limb salvage was the primary indication for surgery (89.7%). Five and 8 years cumulative patency rates were 42.8% and 35.1% respectively for all H.U.V. by-passes and 52.4% and 41.9% respectively for femoropopliteal by-passes. Four out of the 5 femorotibial by-passes failed during the first month following surgery. Two of the 6 axillofemoral and 3 of the 4 composite aortopopliteal by-passes thrombosed within 1 and 3 years after surgery, respectively. Perioperative mortality was 5.1%, while overall mortality was 17.2%. The following conclusions can be drawn from these results: H.U.V. grafts did not achieve cumulative patency rates superior to those reported with autogenous saphenous vein, in limb salvage situations, when the saphenous vein is not available, the H.U.V. graft offers acceptable salvage rates, results from the 8-year follow-up period demonstrate the durability and long-term patency of H.U.V. grafts.\r"

This report identifies two patients who ruptured an aortic aneurysm several \"months\" prior to operation--a \"contained chronic\" rupture.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of aging on calcium and bone metabolism have not been systematically examined in men. To identify age-related alterations in vitamin D and PTH physiology and to assess their impact on skeletal health, we studied 62 normal men, aged 30-92 yr. The men were in excellent health, and none had any evidence of metabolic bone disease and/or known risk factors for osteopenia. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations declined steadily with advancing age (r = -0.47; P less than 0.001), and there was a corresponding decline in serum 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25-(OH)2D] levels (r = -0.41; P less than 0.001). Serum 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations, however, did not vary over this age range (r = -0.07; P = NS). Plasma PTH levels increased with aging (r = -0.24; P less than 0.001), and there was a concomitant increase in urinary cAMP excretion (r = 0.38; P less than 0.001). Renal function (creatinine clearance) clearly declined with increasing age (r = -0.71; P less than 0.001). In conjunction with these changes in calcium metabolism, radial and vertebral bone mineral content declined. Whereas the fall in radial bone mineral content (single photon absorptiometry) at both proximal and distal sites was slight, there was a marked decrease in vertebral bone mineral content, as measured by quantitative computed tomography (r = -0.72; P less than 0.0001). The fall in vertebral bone mineral content correlated well with the declines in serum 25OHD and 24,25-(OH)2D concentrations (r = 0.47; P less than 0.001 and r = 0.51; P less than 0.001, respectively) and with the decline in renal function (r = 0.46; P less than 0.001). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the effects of aging on bone mineral content could be accounted for in large part by concomitant changes in mineral metabolism. Both the decline in renal function and the fall in serum 24,25-(OH)2D levels were closely associated with the fall in bone mineral content. These results indicate that a decline in renal function and alterations in vitamin D metabolism occur with aging in normal men. These changes contribute to, if not cause, the associated decline in skeletal mineral content in aging men.\r"

No difference was found between women with type 1 diabetes and those with gestational diabetes. There was a negative correlation between maternal levels of SMBP during the last trimester and the birth weight percentile of the infants (r = -0.51). There was a 2- to 3-fold elevation of maternal insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) levels during pregnancy in both diabetic and nondiabetic women. A positive correlation (r = 0.49) was found between maternal IGF-I levels and the birth weight percentiles of their infants. The correlation between the ratio of IGF-I to SMBP, which may reflect the IGF-I available to the placenta, to birth weight percentile was higher (r = 0.57), and the SE of estimate of weight percentile was 23%. The ratio between IGF-I and SMBP in cord blood was correlated with birth weight, although cord blood IGF-I and SMBP values were not. The IGF-II levels in cord serum were 50% higher in the infants of diabetic than in those of nondiabetic mothers. These findings raise the questions of whether maternal SMBP levels influence the amount of IGF-I available for the fetal-placental unit and whether IGF-II participates in glucose homeostasis in the fetus.\r"

Basal plasma testosterone to dihydrotestosterone ratios were significantly elevated in two of the three affected infants, and increased markedly in all three infants after administration of hCG. Since urinary etiocholanolone to androsterone ratios could not be determined accurately in this age group, the diagnosis of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency was confirmed by the finding of elevated urinary tetrahydrocortisol (THF) to 5 alpha-tetrahydrocortisol (5 alpha-THF) ratios, as determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, in the affected male infants compared to those in age-matched normal infants. The THF/5 alpha-THF ratios, however, were lower in both the normal children and the affected infants, suggesting increased 5 alpha-reductase activity in infancy. The affected infants had THF/5 alpha-THF ratios comparable to ratios in adult carrier males and significantly lower than ratios in adult homozygotes. Two of the three affected infants are related to the large Dominican kindred we studied previously and initially were raised as females but, after parental counseling, were changed to a male sex of rearing.\r"

  ".W": "We developed a highly sensitive and specific assay for hCG using monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) directed against a 37-amino acid synthetic polypeptide analogous to the carboxyl-terminus (CTP) of beta hCG. Five antibodies that varied by either their affinity for beta hCG or their specificity for epitopes on CTP were investigated. To measure hormone levels, we used as the radiolabeled indicator an alpha-subunit-reactive Mab. The monoclonal-immunoradiometric assay had a lower limit of sensitivity of 0.05 ng/ml. Serum levels of hCG or hCG-like material with CTP structure were measured in 229 healthy blood donors; 1.1% of healthy men and 4.6% of nonpregnant women younger than 50 yr had serum values varying between 0.05 and 0.23 ng/ml. Moreover, 6 to 7 healthy women older than 50 yr had detectable levels in the 0.05-0.20 ng/ml range. To study the disappearance rates in normal women, we followed serum hCG serum levels of 6 women who had previously received a single im injection of the hormone. These individuals failed to develop a pregnancy after in vitro fertilization; hCG declined from 0.5 to 0.05 ng/ml within 2 weeks. These results were in contrast to the findings in 12 patients with hCG-producing tumors. In 9 patients without any evidence of recurrent disease, hCG levels became undetectable within 5 months. However, 3 others had levels consistently above 0.05 but below 0.5 ng/ml. In 2 of these three patients, subsequent increasing hCG levels were associated with tumor recurrence. We conclude that this hCG assay based on both anti-peptide and anti-hCG Mabs may be useful in tumor monitoring.\r"

  ".W": "A 26-yr-old woman presented with hirsutism, male pattern scalp baldness (\"geheimratsecken\"), and menstrual irregularities. She had no hypertension or other signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. Plasma cortisol levels were greatly elevated and did not suppress normally in response to dexamethasone. Cortisol binding to transcortin was normal. Plasma androstenedione and testosterone levels were also increased, but 17-hydroxyprogesterone and aldosterone levels were normal. Further studies revealed an increased cortisol production rate, increased 24-h urinary cortisol excretion, increased plasma ACTH levels, a normal diurnal rhythm of cortisol at an elevated level, and normal increments of plasma ACTH, cortisol, GH, and PRL in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The father and two brothers also had increased plasma cortisol levels, which did not suppress normally in response to dexamethasone. Chronic therapy with dexamethasone (at first 1 and later 0.5 mg, three times daily) for more than 30 weeks resulted in decreased hirsutism, normalization of scalp hair and menstrual cyclicity, and normal plasma testosterone and androstenedione levels. No signs or symptoms of Cushing's syndrome developed, and the central regulation of secretion of ACTH, cortisol, GH, and PRL (insulin test, diurnal rhythm) remained qualitatively normal at a lower set-point. We conclude that this patient had autosomal dominantly inherited hereditary (partial) cortisol insensitivity, which had resulted in increased adrenocortical cortisol and androgen secretion. The latter had not resulted in clinical symptoms in the three afflicted male members of the family, but had in the propositus. The results also indicate the potential usefulness of the insulin test in distinguishing this disorder from Cushing's disease.\r"

If pituitary glands were obtained within 3 h after sudden death of previously normal individuals, the viability of isolated pituitary cells prepared by dispersion with dispase was more than 75%. After 4 days of culture, dopamine (500 nM) inhibited PRL release by cells prepared from four normal pituitaries by 24 +/- 3% (+/- SEM). Pretreatment of the cells with 100 nM estradiol did not alter dopamine-mediated inhibition of PRL release. Estradiol alone increased basal PRL release and cell PRL content. Cultured PRL-secreting pituitary tumor cells, obtained by transsphenoidal operation from four patients, were similarly sensitive to dopamine. Estradiol stimulated tumor cell PRL release and content, but significantly diminished the inhibitory effect of dopamine. The estrogen receptor blocker tamoxifen did not alter PRL release, but it did reverse the estradiol-induced insensitivity of the prolactinoma cells to the dopamine agonist bromocriptine. In conclusion, these in vitro results indicate that estrogens do not antagonize the effect of dopamine on normal human PRL-secreting pituitary cells. In human pituitary tumor cells, however, estradiol decreased the sensitivity of PRL release to dopamine (agonists), and the estrogen action can be acutely reversed by tamoxifen.\r"

Seven patients with Cushing's disease and one with an adrenal adenoma received 600-800 mg/day ketoconazole for 3-13 months. Plasma ACTH, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels and urinary cortisol, 17-ketosteroid, and tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol excretion were determined periodically during the treatment period. Plasma ACTH and cortisol responses to CRH stimulation were determined before and during treatment. Rapid and subsequently persistent clinical improvement occurred in each patient; plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and urinary 17-ketosteroid and cortisol excretion decreased soon after the initiation of treatment, subsequently remaining normal or nearly so throughout the treatment period. Urinary tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol excretion increased significantly. Plasma cortisol levels decreased. Plasma ACTH levels did not change, and individual plasma ACTH and cortisol increments in response to CRH were comparable before and during treatment. The cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia improved in one patient and was restored to normal in another. The seven patients tested recovered normal adrenal suppressibility in response to a low dose of dexamethasone during ketoconazole treatment. Ketoconazole is effective for long term control of hypercortisolism of either pituitary or adrenal origin. Its effect appears to be mediated by inhibition of adrenal 11 beta-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, and it, in some unknown way, prevents the expected rise in ACTH secretion in patients with Cushing's disease.\r"

No C-terminal galanin-like immunoreactivity was detected in plasma or tissue, suggesting differences in the amino acid sequence of human compared with porcine galanin. A non-C-terminally directed antibody was, therefore, used to characterize human galanin immunoreactivity by gel permeation chromatography and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and to localize it by immunocytochemistry. The galanin content of whole adrenal gland was 2.6 +/- 0.9 (+/- SEM) pmol/g (n = 5). In contrast, however, pheochromocytomas had much greater concentrations (21 +/- 2.3 pmol/g; n = 16). Gel chromatography and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography revealed 2 molecular forms of galanin immunoreactivity with identical elution positions in both normal adrenals and tumors. The concentration of galanin in plasma from both normal subjects and pheochromocytoma patients was below the detection limit of the assay (less than 10 pmol/liter). Using immunocytochemistry, galanin was localized to scattered cells or clusters of tumor cells in 5 of 11 pheochromocytomas and only a few chromaffin cells and cortical nerve fibers in normal adrenals.\r"

One patient had a multinodular goiter which impeded localization. In 1 patient with renal osteodystrophy, 2 enlarged parathyroid glands in the neck were not visualized preoperatively. Cytology was not diagnostic, although some cytological features were suggestive of parathyroid cells. Immunostaining of the aspirated smears for PTH, however, correctly diagnosed all preoperatively localized lesions. Ultrasound should be the routine procedure of choice for preoperative localization of abnormal parathyroid glands in primary hyperparathyroidism.

To determine whether such FFA concentrations may increase the concentration of free T4 in serum, we added increasing amounts of oleic acid to pooled normal human serum (with known FFA content) and measured free T4 by equilibrium dialysis. Total FFA up to 3 meq/liter in normal serum, representing an FFA to albumin molar ratio of about 5:1, had little or no effect on the free T4 concentration, while higher FFA concentrations progressively increased free T4. This same molar ratio of FFA to albumin had to be exceeded to cause a significant increase in the free T4 concentration in diluted serum and in serum from patients with nonthyroid illness. Serum from which more than 95% of the albumin had been removed by chromatography with Affi-Gel blue was much more sensitive to the effects of FFA on free T4. This enhanced sensitivity was reversed by readdition of albumin to the serum, and the addition of albumin to normal serum resulted in diminished effects of FFA on free T4. These results indicate the following: physiological concentrations of FFA do not significantly increase the free T4 concentration in normal human serum; when FFA reach supraphysiological concentrations in serum (in vitro) and the higher affinity FFA-binding sites on albumin become saturated (apparently at an FFA to albumin molar ratio of approximately 5:1), the excess FFA interact with other serum proteins, including thyroid hormone-binding globulin, and thereby increase the free T4 concentration; the concentration of albumin (or other FFA binders) must be considered when evaluating the observed effects of FFA. To explore the relevance of these findings to the hypothesis that FFA may inhibit the binding of T4 to plasma proteins in patients with nonthyroid illness, we measured plasma FFA concentrations in 11 severely ill patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit. We found a mean plasma FFA concentration of 0.45 +/- 0.11 (+/- SEM) mEq/liter and a mean serum albumin concentration of 2.39 +/- 0.29 g/dl in these patients. Their mean plasma FFA to albumin molar ratio was 1.53 +/- 0.41. Since the FFA to albumin molar ratio must exceed about approximately 5:1 before a significant increase in the serum free T4 concentration occurs, these results suggest that FFA do not commonly influence the circulating free T4 concentration in vivo, even in severely ill patients.\r"

A reasonable assessment of bioavailable T can be made by using 50% ammonium sulfate to precipitate sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-bound T. The supernatant non-SHBG-bound T (non-SHBG-T) correlates well with physiological androgen activity. To assess bioavailable T in normal aging men, we analyzed serum samples from seven healthy aged men (65-83 yr old) and compared the results to samples from 13 young men (22-39 yr old). Mean serum T, FT, and LH concentrations were not significantly different in the 2 groups. However, the mean absolute non-SHBG-T level was significantly lower (P less than 0.005) in the older group. In a separate population of 20 impotent but otherwise healthy men (5 27-37 yr old, 10 48-64 yr old, and 5 66-69 yr old), the mean absolute non-SHBG-T concentration was lower in middle-aged (P less than .01) and elderly men (P less than 0.001) than in young men. The absolute FT was lower only in the elderly group (P less than 0.05), while mean LH and T levels were similar in all 3 age groups. These data suggest that serum concentrations of tissue available T are decreased in aged men and that non-SHBG-T measurement is a more sensitive indicator of this decrease than are serum T or serum FT measurements. These changes appear to begin by middle age.\r"

Incubation of macrophages with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in the conversion of [3H]25OHD3 to a more polar vitamin D3 metabolite (up to 15 pmol/10(6) cells). Untreated macrophages did not synthesize this metabolite. Several findings suggested that the metabolite was the biologically active form of vitamin D3, namely 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3]. (1) The metabolite comigrated with chemically synthesized 1,25-(OH)2D3 on four different high performance liquid chromatographic systems. (2) The metabolite had the same affinity for the chick intestinal 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor as authentic 1,25-(OH)2D3. (3) The biological activity of the macrophage metabolite in vivo (stimulation of intestinal calcium absorption and bone calcium mobilization in rachitic chicks) was identical to the activity of chemically synthesized 1,25-(OH)2D3. The LPS-stimulated synthesis of the 1,25-(OH)2D3-like compound by macrophages was dose dependent in a linear fashion; a half-maximal response was typically found with 100-200 ng LPS/10(6) cells. Polymyxin B abolished the effects of LPS on 25OHD3 metabolism in macrophages. Our data suggest that LPS-stimulated macrophages can modulate, on a local level, the function of 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive cells by releasing the 1,25-(OH)2D3-like metabolite.\r"

Pretreatment (day 3) serum T4 and T3 concentrations were 49 micrograms/dl and 590 ng/dl, respectively. With 24 h after the first dose of ipodate, serum T3 fell by 40%, and it subsequently ranged from 209-278 ng/dl throughout the 39-day ipodate treatment period. Serum T4 also decreased after ipodate administration to 69% and 41% of the pretreatment value after 72 h and 7 days of treatment, respectively; values thereafter during treatment ranged from 19-22 micrograms/dl. These plateau values are in the upper range of normal for the neonatal period. Rapid clinical improvement occurred as the hyperiodothyroninemia abated. Serum rT3 concentrations increased from 468-672 ng/dl to greater than 1400 ng/dl 24 h after each ipodate dose. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin was present in maternal and cord sera, and the half-life of serum thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin in the infant was approximately 12 days. Antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies were present in the infant at 10 days of age, and the titers decreased progressively thereafter; the half-life for the antimicrosomal antibody titer was 3 weeks. The data suggest that sodium ipodate can be useful for treatment of neonatal hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease.\r"

Both groups of patients were receiving T4 when studied. [3H]Thymidine incorporation induced by 0.1 mU/ml bovine TSH was significantly inhibited by the addition of 2 mg/ml IgG from patients with primary myxedema (P less than 0.01), while it was not affected by IgG from the normal subjects or 23 of the 24 patients with goitrous Hashimoto's thyroiditis. IgG from patients with primary myxedema also inhibited the [3H]thymidine incorporation induced by Graves' IgG, but not that induced by forskolin, cholera toxin, (Bu)2cAMP or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. The inhibition of TSH-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation by IgGs from patients with primary myxedema was significantly correlated with their inhibitory activities against both TSH-induced cAMP generation and TSH binding (P less than 0.001). These data indicate that these growth-blocking antibodies are directed against the TSH receptor and might be one of the causes of the thyroid atrophy in patients with primary myxedema.\r"

  ".W": "Primary monolayer cultures of human fetal adrenal cells maintained in either lipoprotein-depleted or lipoprotein-supplemented media responded chronically to ACTH treatment with similarly increased steroid secretion. The principal steroid secreted into each medium was dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. The presence of human low density lipoprotein (hLDL) in the medium enhanced the secretion of nonsulfoconjugated steroids, especially dehydroepiandrosterone. The secretion rate of 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione was similar to that of cortisol. In the absence of hLDL, ACTH increased cholesterologenesis to maintain the high rates of steroid secretion. After ACTH treatment, increased accumulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a rate-determining enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, was found. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that this enzyme was a 97K protein in human fetal adrenal cells. Interestingly, the content of this enzyme in cells treated with ACTH in lipoprotein-depleted medium was similar to that in adrenal fetal zone tissue. This finding suggests that cholesterologenesis de novo in addition to plasma LDL is important as a source of steroid precursor in vivo in the human fetal adrenal gland.\r"

Seven normal women received CC or placebo in alternate cycles in a randomized double blind fashion. On the day after drug administration, blood samples were obtained at 15-min intervals for 8 h for serum LH determinations. Daily blood samples were also obtained throughout the luteal phase for determination of serum LH, estradiol (E2), and progesterone. LH pulse frequency increased from 2.4 +/- 0.5 (+/- SEM)/8 h after placebo to 3.9 +/- 0.6/8 h (P less than 0.01) after CC treatment, but pulse amplitude did not change. The transverse mean of serum LH was higher after CC (13.6 +/- 0.5 mIU/ml) than after placebo (8.4 +/- 0.3 mIU/ml; P less than 0.001), and luteal phase length was increased from 13.5 +/- 0.5 to 16.0 +/- 0.4 days (P less than 0.001) by administration of CC. Luteal phase levels of E2 and progesterone measured daily were significantly elevated (P less than 0.01) in CC-treated cycles. These findings suggest that CC increases the frequency of hypothalamic GnRH secretory episodes, perhaps by an action involving a decrease in endogenous opioid peptide activity. Since peripheral progesterone levels were elevated in the CC-treated cycles, E2 may play a permissive role in the ability of progesterone to increase endogenous opioid peptide activity acutely. Furthermore, since the luteal phase was significantly prolonged by an increase in endogenous LH pulse frequency, the slow frequency of LH pulses in the normal late luteal phase may contribute to the onset of luteolysis in the human.\r"

The women whose infants had the FAS had decreased estradiol and estriol levels throughout pregnancy. Progesterone levels also tended to be low. In contrast, the alcohol users had increased PRL levels during the 16-24th weeks of pregnancy compared with those in the abstinent women, but this rise was not related to the FAS. The concentrations of hCG fluctuated widely, without any consistent difference between alcohol users and abstinent women. Thus, heavy maternal abuse of alcohol resulting in FAS is accompanied, primarily or secondarily, by reduced estrogen concentrations throughout pregnancy and increased PRL levels during the 16-24th weeks of pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Half-hourly sampling of plasma TSH was done across 3 days in four normal young men. Sleep was denied for 64 h from 0700 h on awakening from accommodation sleep until polygraphic sleep was resumed at 7100 h of the third day (D3) such that 2 consecutive nights of usual 2300-0700 h sleep were missed. This protocol allowed examination of any modulatory effects on the daily patterns in TSH concentrations during sleep deprivation on D1-2 (1100-3500, 3500-5900 h) or during resumption of usual nightly sleep on D3 (5900-8300) compared to that of a previously studied group of normal young men. The circadian nature of the daily TSH waveform was evidenced by its daily repetition within a subject both basally and during D1-2 sleep deprivation and by its synchronization within the basal, deprived, or resumed sleep days. The peaks in each subject's daily TSH patterns on D1-2 were consistently longer, and the daily maxima and cosine acrophases on D1-2 were consistently later than those on D3 when basal sleep was resumed. About half the daily TSH concentration maxima and daily cosinor amplitudes on D1-2 were greater than those of the respective sleep-resumed TSH patterns of D3. Both the group mean TSH patterns and the cosinor 95% confidence ellipses also indicated the daily peak in the TSH waveform to be significantly longer, later, and larger during D1-2 sleep deprivation than during the basal or D3 periods. These results indicate that significant alteration of the daily TSH waveform can occur in response to absence of sleep and are compatible with the existence of an inhibitory effect in early nightly sleep on TSH release. The TSH patterns during the 1700-2300 h intervals of rising TSH levels were congruent in the basal, deprived, and resumed sleep periods. Prompt reversion to the basal TSH pattern also occurred when sleep was resumed on D3. Both of these observations suggest the alteration in TSH waveform during sleep deprivation to have arisen from an inhibitory effect in sleep rather than from a change in period or phase of a generating oscillator.\r"

Measurements were made during 5-h glucose clamp studies, carried out at plasma insulin concentrations of about 10 microU/ml (0-150 min) and about 60 microU/ml (150-300 min). Differences between the patient groups were compared by two-way analysis of variance. The ability of insulin to either suppress plasma FFA concentrations or stimulate glucose uptake was significantly reduced (P less than 0.001) in patients with NIDDM, and this was true of both the obese and nonobese groups. The defect in the ability of insulin to suppress plasma FFA concentrations in patients with NIDDM was more apparent at the lower insulin concentration, whereas resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in NIDDM was more dramatic at the high insulin concentration. Finally, a significant correlation (r = -0.67; P less than 0.001) between insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and plasma FFA concentration was found in the entire group. These data emphasize the fact that patients with NIDDM are resistant to multiple actions of insulin, and that the magnitudes of the defect in insulin suppression of plasma FFA levels and stimulation of tissue glucose uptake are roughly comparable.\r"

  ".U": "87057976\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin may mediate the hyperandrogenism that frequently occurs in patients with insulin-resistant states. To test this hypothesis, we studied five normal women and one woman with hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. Each woman received a 0.1 U/kg insulin bolus dose, followed by a 10 mU/kg X min insulin infusion for 12-16 h. In the normal women, an average insulin level of 1832 +/- 292 (+/- SEM) microU/ml was achieved; serum glucose was clamped at 116 +/- 5 mg/dl. At this level, insulin may bind to the insulin-like growth factor I receptor as well as to its own receptor. Contrary to our working hypothesis, a rise in serum testosterone did not occur in any women during insulin infusion, and in one women, serum testosterone levels decreased. When analyzed as a percentage of the basal value, serum progesterone levels fell 20% in the normal women within the first 2 h of insulin infusion, but did not change thereafter. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels, however, uniformly and progressively decreased by 39% after 12 h of insulin infusion in the normal women and by 31% at 14 h in the woman with hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans. The fall in serum DHEA-S levels was not due to diurnal rhythmicity, as the changes in serum DHEA-S levels did not correlated with those in serum cortisol. Suppression of PRL release also was excluded as a cause of the fall in DHEA-S levels. These results indicate that acute hyperinsulinemia of 12- to 16-h duration does not increase serum testosterone or DHEA-S concentrations and, indeed, can cause a decline in serum DHEA-S levels in both normal women and the single woman studied with hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans.\r"

Treatment for 3 months with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) led to an improvement in behavior and the reporting, for the first time, of a sensation of thirst. After DDAVP therapy both patients had a reduction of their renal sensitivity to infused vasopressin. We conclude that untreated patients with essential hypernatremia have increased renal sensitivity to vasopressin which is reduced by DDAVP administration.\r"

Plasma OT levels were measured by RIA before, during, and after private self-stimulation to orgasm in normal men (n = 9) and women (n = 13). Blood samples were collected continuously through indwelling venous catheters. The subjects pressed a signal to indicate the start and finish of orgasm/ejaculation. Objective assessment of sexual arousal and orgasm was obtained by measuring blood-pulse amplitude and electromyographic activity, recorded continuously throughout testing from an anal device containing a photoplethysmograph and electromyograph electrodes connected to a polygraph located in an adjacent room. These measures allowed collection of data from men and women of changes in blood flow and muscle activity in the lower pelvic/pubic area. Plasma OT levels increased during sexual arousal in both women and men and were significantly higher during orgasm/ejaculation than during prior baseline testing. We suggest that the temporal pattern of secretion could be related to smooth muscle contractions of the reproductive system during orgasm.\r"

  ".W": "In the course of characterizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) recognizing cell surface antigens on dispersed human parathyroid cells (dPTCs), we identified one MAb (4F2) that bound avidly to parathyroid cells and had marked effects on parathyroid function. The binding of MAb 4F2 to human adenomatous dPTCs resulted in a marked [53.8 +/- 7.9% (+/- SEM)] reduction in low calcium (Ca)-stimulated PTH secretion to levels equivalent to those in cell suppressed by high extracellular Ca (1.5 mM). Typically, these functional effects were optimal at antibody dilutions of 1:10(4) to 1:10(5). Cell viability was confirmed at the conclusion of each experiment by trypan blue exclusion (greater than 90-95%) and cell surface immunofluorescence. Parallel studies using the Ca-sensitive dye Quin-2 showed that inhibition of PTH secretion in 4F2-treated cells was associated with a concomitant increase in cytosolic Ca (Cai) of 188% in 0.5 mM Ca; these values also approached Cai levels in control cells incubated in high Ca. Mab controls, P3 X 63, which do not bind to dPTCs, and Mab LC7-2, which recognizes a different epitope of the same antigen as 4F2 on dPTCs, did not alter PTH secretion or Cai. Immunoprecipitation of 125I-labeled parathyroid cell extracts with MAb 4F2 demonstrated proteins with mol wt of approximately 145, 85, and 45 under nonreducing conditions and 85 and 45 kilodaltons after reduction with 5% mercaptoethanol. These studies suggest that 1) Mab-4F2 binding to its cell surface antigen inhibits PTH secretion by human adenomatous parathyroid cells in vitro; 2) the alterations in secretory function could be related to by an attendant increase in Cai; 3) the 4F2 antigen on dPTCs is a heterodimeric protein of (approximately) 85K and 45K; and 4) the 4F2 antigen may be an important component of the Ca-sensing and/or signal-transducing mechanism in this cell.\r"

  ".U": "87057984\r", 
  ".W": "We undertook a study of the separate and combined effects of age and sex on the pulsatile pattern of GH secretion. The 24-h secretory profile of GH was generated by 20-min sampling in 10 young women (aged 18-33 yr), 10 young men (aged 18-33 yr), 8 postmenopausal women (aged greater than 55 yr), and 8 older men (aged greater than 55 yr). A computer-assisted pulse analysis program was used to assess both total GH secretion, as reflected in the 24-h integrated GH concentration (IGHC), and pulsatile secretion, as denoted by pulse frequency, duration, amplitude, and the fraction of GH secreted in pulses during the 24-h period (FGHP). IGHC was significantly greater in women than in men (P less than 0.025) and greater in the young than in the old (P less than 0.003). The mean pulse amplitude, duration, and FGHP were each greater in the young (P less than 0.006, P less than 0.03, and P less than 0.0001, respectively), but not significantly different between the sexes. The mean pulse frequency was not affected by sex or age. The serum concentration of free estradiol, but not free testosterone, correlated with IGHC (r = 0.46; P less than 0.005), pulse amplitude (r = 0.53; P less than 0.001), and FGHP (r = 0.59; P less than 0.0002). After correcting for the effects of estradiol, neither sex nor age influenced IGHC or mean pulse amplitude, while the effect of age on FGHP was reduced from 81% to 29%. Of the indices of GH secretion, FGHP had the strongest correlation (r = 0.43; P less than 0.006) with somatomedin-C. Somatomedin-C declined significantly with age in both sexes. Our results indicate that sex and age have independent and interrelated effects on GH secretion. These effects can be largely accounted for by corresponding variations in endogenous estradiol levels. These observations suggest an amplifying action of estradiol on the neuroendocrine regulation of pulsatile GH release.\r"

The depolarization was associated with decreased input resistance. Ca ionophore A23187 caused similar mesangial cell contraction and depolarization. The reversal potential (Vr) of the depolarization response to AII and AVP was -29 +/- 3 and -25 +/- 7 mV (mean +/- SD), respectively. Not only the Vr of the AII-induced depolarization but also Vr of the Ca ionophore-induced response was dependent upon the extracellular Cl- concentration. Further, AII and AVP caused cell contraction and membrane depolarization in Ca++-free medium containing 0.5 mM EGTA. These data suggest the presence of Ca++ -activated Cl- channels in the mesangial cells and that AII and AVP increase Cl- permeability via an elevation of [Ca++]i released from the intracellular organellae.\r"

One population is normal; the second population appears to have a deletion of about 10 amino acid residues from the middle of the triple helical domain. The mutation in pro alpha 2(I) causes increased posttranslational modification in the amino-terminal half of some pro alpha 1(I) chains, lowers the melting temperature of type I collagen molecules that incorporate a mutant pro alpha 2(I) chain, and prevents or delays the secretion of those molecules from fibroblasts in cell culture. On the basis of this study and linkage studies in additional families, it appears that the OI type IV phenotype is often the result of heterozygosity for mutations in pro alpha 2(I) that alter the triple helical structure of type I collagen.\r"

Hypertensives had higher resistance (2,295 vs. 1713 dyn-s/cm5), characteristic impedance (145.7 vs. 93.9 dyn-s/cm5), total external power (1,579 vs. 1174 mW), peripheral reflections (ratio of backward to forward wave components of 0.54 vs. 0.44), and first zero crossing of impedance phase angle (4.15 vs. 2.97 Hz). These abnormalities were eliminated with vasodilatation. Differences between groups were not further exacerbated when pressure was increased during handgrip exercise. Beta blockade further increased resistance and reflections. Thus, hemodynamic abnormalities of essential hypertension (increased resistance, reflections, and pulse wave velocity, and decreased compliance) are compatible with an increased vasomotor tone that is further unmasked during generalized beta blockade.\r"

Isotopic sodium uptake was stimulated by bicarbonate when compared with gluconate (2.5 nmol/mg protein per 5 s versus 1.4 nmol/mg protein per 5 s), and this process was inhibited by disulfonic stilbenes. Imposition of an interior-positive potassium diffusion potential further stimulated isotopic sodium uptake to 3.4 nmol/mg protein per 5 s, an effect that occurred only in the presence of bicarbonate and was blocked by disulfonic stilbenes. Kinetic analysis of the rate of bicarbonate-dependent sodium uptake as a function of sodium concentration revealed saturable stimulation with a Vmax of 2.7 nmol/mg protein per 2 s and a Km of 10.4 mM. The effect of bicarbonate concentration on bicarbonate-dependent sodium uptake was more complex. The present results demonstrate an electrogenic (negatively charged) sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter in basolateral membrane vesicles from the rabbit renal cortex. The electrogenicity implies a stoichiometry of at least two bicarbonate ions for each sodium ion.\r"

Both types of cells exhibit elevated permeabilities to sodium and potassium, in the case of sickle cells, when deoxygenated. The ouabain-insensitive fluxes of sodium and potassium were equivalent, however, in both cell types under these conditions. When incubated 18 hours in vitro, sickle cells lost cations but only when deoxygenated. This cation depletion was blocked by ouabain, removal of external potassium, or pretreatment with 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, which blocks the increase in cation permeability induced by deoxygenation. The loss of cation exhibited by oxygenated xerocytes similarly incubated was also blocked by ouabain. These data support the hypothesis that the elevated \"passive\" cation fluxes of xerocytes and deoxygenated sickle cells are not directly responsible for cation depletion of these cells; rather, these pathologic leaks interact with the sodium pump to produce a net loss of cellular cation.\r"

The former would result in progenitors at midswitch with skewed fractional beta-globin synthesis programs, the latter in a Gaussian distribution. For these studies, we obtained bone marrow from rhesus monkey fetuses at 141-153 d (midswitch). Mononuclear cells were cultured in methyl cellulose with erythropoietin, and single BFU-E-derived colonies were removed and incubated with [3H]leucine. Globin synthesis was examined by gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The beta-globin synthesis pattern of single fetal colonies was skewed, and did not fit a normal distribution. The fetal pattern resembled the pattern of an artificial mixture of fetal and adult progenitors, suggesting that the fetal progenitor pool could contain populations with different beta-globin programs. This non-Gaussian distribution in the progenitors of midswitch fetuses is consistent with a discontinuous model for hemoglobin switching during ontogeny.\r"

Only higher primate species showed cross-reactivity, and IGF-I, IGF-II, and other peptides were without effect. Circulating BP levels in healthy subjects rose threefold from early childhood to puberty. In 65 adults aged 18 to 65, the mean level (+/- SD) was 6.12 +/- 1.43 micrograms/ml, and declined with age. Strong growth hormone-dependence of BP was also seen; there was a 2.2-fold increase in active acromegaly and a 50-80% reduction in growth hormone deficiency. Poorly controlled diabetic subjects had BP levels 40% below normal, whereas in renal failure and third-term pregnancy a mild elevation was seen. Measurement of BP may provide a useful adjunct to IGF assays in growth disorders.\r"

The major peak of LPL activity after gel filtration of PHP eluted after the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and just before the peak of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. When PHP contained chylomicrons, an additional peak of LPL activity eluted in the void volume of the column. Most HTGL activity eluted after the LDL and preceded the elution of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. LPL activity in preheparin plasma eluted in the same position, relative to lipoproteins, as did LPL in PHP. Gel filtration of purified human milk LPL mixed with plasma or isolated LDL produced a peak of activity eluting before LDL. During gel filtration of PHP in high salt buffer (1 M NaCl) or after isolation of lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation in high salt density solutions, most of the lipase activity was not associated with lipoproteins. LPL activity was removed from PHP by elution through immunoaffinity columns containing antibodies to apolipoprotein (apo) B and apo E. Since lipoproteins in PHP have undergone prior in vivo lipolysis, LPL activity in PHP may be bound to remnants of chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins.\r"

Infusion with 7 or 65 pmol 1,25(OH)2D3 X 24 h-1 led to normal or slight hypercalcemia associated with physiological and supraphysiological plasma concentrations of the hormone while calcium supplementation normalized plasma calcium despite 1,25(OH)2D3 concentrations as low as those observed in hypocalcemic controls. Constant administrations of [14C]D3 during the supplementation regimens uncovered a stimulation of the in vivo 25(OH)D3 production by calcium supplementation; this was further confirmed in vitro by an increase in the hepatic microsomal D3-25 hydroxylase. The group supplemented with pharmacological doses of the hormone displayed lower circulating concentrations of both D3 and 25(OH)D3 while the in vitro 25(OH)D3 production remained unaffected by 1,25(OH)2D3. Investigation of the kinetics of intravenous 25(OH)[3H]D3 revealed similar elimination constants in all groups. The data indicate that calcium supplementation of hypocalcemic D-depleted rats results in an increased transformation of D3 into 25(OH)D3 while supplementation with 1,25(OH)2D3 does not affect the in vitro D3-25 hydroxylase but seems to influence the in vivo handling of the vitamin by accelerating its metabolism.\r"

A large portion of the variability of 24EE among individuals, independent of differences in body size, was due to variability in the degree of spontaneous physical activity, i.e., \"fidgeting,\" which accounted for 100-800 kcal/d in these subjects.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if constituents of cotton plants might play a role in byssinosis by injuring pulmonary epithelium, we added extracts of cotton dust, green bract, and field-dried bract to human A549 and rat type II pneumocytes. Injury was measured as pneumocyte lysis and detachment, and inhibition of protein synthesis. Extracts of cotton dust and field-dried bract produced significant dose- and time-dependent lysis and detachment of both target cells, while green bract extract was less damaging. Extracts treated with polyvinylpolypyrrolidone to remove tannins produced significantly less injury. In contrast, purified 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxy-flavan 3,4-diol (THF), a tannin in cotton dust and bract, caused substantial cell damage. Field-dried bract extract and THF also produced dose-dependent inhibition of pneumocyte protein synthesis. Endotoxin levels did not correlate with observed injury. THF added to rat tracheal explants caused epithelial disruption and desquamation, whereas endotoxin did not. Instillation of cotton dust and field-dried bract extract in rat lungs produced disruption of bronchial epithelium and smooth muscle constriction, while polyvinylpolypyrrolidone-treated cotton dust extract produced no injury. These findings suggest that extracts of cotton plants are toxic to alveolar, tracheal, and bronchial epithelium and that THF or other tannins may be the responsible agents.\r"

We have found that the cochemotaxin attaches to the oligosaccharide chain of native C5a des Arg to form a complex with potent chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Although capable of enhancing the chemotactic activity of native C5a des Arg, the cochemotaxin had no effect on the chemotactic activity of either deglycosylated C5a des Arg, native C5a, or N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Of the known components of the oligosaccharide chain, only sialic acid prevented enhancement by the cochemotaxin of the chemotactic activity exhibited by native C5a des Arg. Sialic acid also prevented the formation of C5a des Arg-cochemotaxin complexes, detected by acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, molecular sieve chromatography on polyacrylamide gels, and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation.\r"

  ".W": "Small amounts (0.1-0.5 mM) of deoxycholate enhanced amylase secretion, which had been induced by submaximal doses of carbachol or cholecystokinin octapeptide, without affecting the maximal levels of these reactions from isolated rat pancreatic acini. Deoxycholate alone did not induce these reactions. The other bile acids such as cholate, chenodeoxycholate, ursodeoxycholate, and taurocholate were also active. Under the similar conditions, deoxycholate enhanced the secretagogue-induced diacylglycerol formation that was derived mainly from the phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate. Deoxycholate did not enhance the secretagogue-induced hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate or Ca2+ mobilization. Deoxycholate did not affect amylase secretion, which was induced by the simultaneous addition of protein kinase C-activating 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Since diacylglycerol and Ca2+ may be responsible for the secretagogue-induced amylase secretion, our results indicate that small amounts of bile acids increase the sensitivity to the secretagogue of diacylglycerol formation and subsequent activation of protein kinase C, and thereby enhance amylase secretion from pancreatic acini.\r"

We found that varying peritubular [Cl] changed the Cl self-exchange rate with saturation kinetics (Km, 3-4 mM). HCO3 secretion also showed saturation kinetics as a function of mean luminal [Cl] (Km, 4-11 mM). Both Cl self-exchange and Cl-HCO3 exchange thus appear to be carrier-mediated. Addition/removal of basolateral HCO3 qualitatively changed Cl and HCO3 transport as expected for Cl-HCO3 exchange, but quantitatively changed Cl absorption more than HCO3 secretion. The diffusive Cl permeability and the transepithelial conductance in the presence of HCO3/CO2 and cAMP were higher than in their absence suggesting that HCO3/CO2 and cAMP together increase a conductive Cl pathway parallel to a 1:1 Cl-HCO3 exchanger. Thus, cAMP not only stimulates the overall process of anion exchange (probably by increasing an electroneutral exchanger and/or a series Cl conductance), but also stimulates a Cl conductance parallel to the exchange process.\r"

When the morphological transitions are initiated by a temperature shift from 25 degrees to 37 degrees C, all three strains undergo similar physiological changes, but these are less severe in G184A and G222B than in the Downs strain. The transitions from mycelial to yeast morphology in both of the more virulent strains are also one-third more rapid than in Downs. We also find that the differences in temperature sensitivity of the three strains can be correlated with the temperature required for complete uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. The differences in sensitivity to elevated temperatures extend to the growth of yeast cells of all three strains. Considered together, our results suggest that sensitivity to elevated temperatures may be a key factor accounting for differences in virulence and that uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation may be the primary event in the morphological transition in all three strains.\r"

Accordingly, we have surveyed membrane skeletal protein interactions during storage. We uncovered a decrease in the in vitro formation of spectrin-actin complex in the absence (50%) or presence (60%) of protein 4.1. Actual formation of the spectrin-actin-protein 4.1 complex fell in a linear fashion during the storage period. This fall in spectrin-actin interaction tightly correlated with the decline in total red cell phospholipid (R = 0.9932) measured simultaneously. This decrement of spectrin-actin association could be restored to greater than 70% of normal values by preincubation of stored spectrin with 50 mM dithiothreitol. This storage injury to spectrin-actin interaction might weaken the membrane skeleton and lead to decreased red cell survival. In vitro reversibility of the damage by reducing agents suggests a possible new direction for prolonging the shelf life of stored blood.\r"

Human eosinophils (25-95% purity) were obtained from donors with a variety of diseases associated with hypereosinophilia. PAF-acether elicited directional locomotion of eosinophils, in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, at concentrations from 10(-5) to 10(-8) M; lyso-PAF had minimal activity over the same dose range. Compared with PAF-acether, the eosinophil locomotory responsiveness of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), histamine, and the valyl- and alanyl-eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A) tetrapeptides was negligible. Conversely, neutrophil responsiveness to PAF-acether (optimum 10(-6) M) was comparable in effect to LTB4 (optimum dose 10(-8) M). It was shown that PAF-acether elicited both chemotaxis and chemokinesis of eosinophils. Comparison of normal density and light density eosinophils revealed no qualitative difference in the response to PAF-acether and the other chemoattractants, although the light density cells seemed to demonstrate a greater degree of locomotion to PAF-acether and LTB4. Thus, PAF-acether appears to be a potent eosinophilotactic agent which may play a role in inflammatory reactions characterized by eosinophil infiltration.\r"

Polyadenylated hepatic apoB-100 mRNA from two abetalipoproteinemic patients was normal in size, and the concentration of apoB-100 mRNA was increased sixfold compared with control hepatic apoB-100 mRNA levels. ApoB-100 was detected in hepatocytes of abetalipoproteinemic patients by immunohistochemical techniques.

Radioiodinated thrombospondin bound to thrombin-stimulated platelets from normal and thrombasthenic donors with a similar affinity and capacity. As monitored with a monoclonal antibody to thrombospondin, the divalent ion-dependent and -independent pathways for the expression of the endogenous pool of thrombospondin on the surface of thrombin-stimulated platelets from normal and thrombasthenic donors were also qualitatively and quantitatively similar. GPIIb-IIIa or ligands associated with GPIIb-IIIa thus are not essential for the binding of thrombospondin to platelets. Therefore, thrombospondin interacts with unique receptors on platelets.\r"

Similar changes have been reported in apparently normal mucosa bordering colorectal cancer. \"Normal\" left sided colorectal mucosa from 32 patients with rectal cancer was studied. Each case was matched by age and sex to a patient with diverticular disease and a patient with irritable bowel syndrome. Twenty five patients with right sided cancer were matched to patients with Crohn's disease. Sections were stained with mild periodic acid Schiff (mPAS) (selectively stains N-acetyl sialic acid lacking in O-acetyl group) and other closely related techniques. Reactions were graded negative, weak, and intense. An intense reaction was found in 9% of cases; there was no difference between the various matched groups. Phenylhydrazine interposition failed to block the mPAS effect, indicating that a positive result was due to a deficiency of sialic acid with O-acetyl substituents rather than neutral mucin. Different staining patterns in left and right colon were probably due to differing ratios of total sialic acid:fucose. These findings indicate a hitherto unsuspected colorectal goblet cell sialomucin heterogeneity within the general population, but no association with neoplastic disease is apparent.\r"

The results of this study confirm previous reports that NSE and S100 protein are useful markers for malignant melanoma. NSE staining intensity in the cases of malignant melanoma was significantly higher than that in benign naevi (p = 0.011). Intensity of staining for S100 protein was not significantly higher in the malignant melanomas. There was, however, a significant S100 gradient when comparing superficial and deep intradermal portions of these tumours (p = 0.003). This feature was not seen in benign naevi. The greatest intensity of S100 protein staining was found in the deeper portions of the malignant melanomas. This gradient difference was not seen with staining for NSE. Although it seems that the overall intensity of staining for NSE is more effective in differentiating between benign and malignant lesions, the difference in staining intensity between the superficial and deep portions of the tumour may be the better indicator of adverse behaviour in lesions in which the diagnosis of malignancy is uncertain.\r"

We have now evaluated more dilute concentrations of bleomycin in the treatment of recalcitrant warts. Warts were assigned for therapy with intralesional bleomycin at a concentration of 0.25 U/ml, 0.5 U/ml, or 1 U/ml at 3-week intervals. If warts persisted after three injections or had recurred by 3 months' follow-up, treatment was considered a failure. Twenty-six patients whose warts had persisted after conventional treatment entered the study. Three patients had spontaneous regression of untreated warts during therapy and were not included in the results. Of seventy-nine warts treated with intralesional bleomycin, sixty-two (78%) were cured after one to three injections. Responding warts showed a hemorrhagic eschar even with the lower bleomycin concentrations and healed without complication. Almost all treated warts responded, although not all were cured. Treatment with bleomycin at 0.5 U/ml was as effective as treatment with 1 U/ml. Bleomycin at 0.25 U/ml is effective therapy but not enough warts were treated to permit a conclusion when compared with higher concentrations.\r"

Aspects of treatment covered include selection and use of appropriate equipment, indications and contraindications for specific tumors, preoperative preparation, various treatment technics with clinical and instrumental depth-dose monitoring, postoperative care, cure rate, and cosmetic and functional end results. The overall results obtained by cryosurgery compare favorably with those obtained by other modalities. Cryosurgery is the treatment of choice for some basal cell carcinomas and a satisfactory alternate treatment for others.\r"

Distal yellow-brown discoloration, subungual hyperkeratosis, nail plate thickening, and splinter hemorrhages indicate a diagnosis of type 1 pityriasis rubra pilaris rather than psoriasis, while onycholysis (particularly marginal), salmon patches, small pits, and larger indentations of the nail plate indicate a diagnosis of psoriasis. Histology demonstrated that a nail biopsy would be a useful diagnostic procedure if nails were involved in isolation but provided no additional diagnostic features to those found from biopsy specimens of involved skin in the two conditions. The similarity in nail morphology between the type 1 pityriasis rubra pilaris patients and five patients with chronic erythroderma resulting from Sezary syndrome indicated that these changes may represent a nonspecific reaction pattern that may result from prolonged erythema of the proximal nail bed and matrix. The rough nails (trachyonychia) described in advanced Sezary syndrome were not observed in any of our patients.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred ninety-seven long-term photochemotherapy (PUVA)-treated patients from an original cohort of 418 subjects reported in 1980 were reevaluated in a second follow-up in order to determine the risk of tumor development under long-term PUVA. Within an observation period of up to 8 years (mean, 63.1 months) six patients with squamous cell carcinomas and three with basal cell carcinomas were observed. Eight of the nine tumor patients had been exposed to potential carcinogens such as arsenic and/or ionizing radiation prior to PUVA treatment. Five with squamous cell carcinomas were skin type I or II; in four of the six patients with squamous cell carcinomas the tumors were located on unexposed skin areas. The mean cumulative ultraviolet A (UVA) dose in three of the six squamous cell carcinoma patients was three times as high as that in the group of nontumor patients. The other three squamous cell carcinoma patients had lower mean doses than nontumor patients, as did the three patients with basal cell carcinomas. Although the cumulative UVA dose may eventually turn out to be relevant for PUVA carcinogenesis, our present data do not sufficiently substantiate a correlation between cumulative UVA dose and squamous cell carcinoma formation in PUVA-treated patients. This report confirms that previous exposure to carcinogens appears to be the most important factor for nonmelanoma skin tumor formation in long-term PUVA patients.\r"

The level of vitiligo antibodies in the three groups expressed as a binding index was 2.9% +/- 2.03, 5.6% +/- 2.92, and 8.0% +/- 3.03 SD, respectively.

The two estrogen regimens and dextrothyroxine were discontinued early because of adverse effects. No evidence of efficacy was found for the clofibrate treatment. Niacin treatment showed modest benefit in decreasing definite nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction but did not decrease total mortality. With a mean follow-up of 15 years, nearly 9 years after termination of the trial, mortality from all causes in each of the drug groups, except for niacin, was similar to that in the placebo group. Mortality in the niacin group was 11% lower than in the placebo group (52.0 versus 58.2%; p = 0.0004). This late benefit of niacin, occurring after discontinuation of the drug, may be a result of a translation into a mortality benefit over subsequent years of the early favorable effect of niacin in decreasing nonfatal reinfarction or a result of the cholesterol-lowering effect of niacin, or both.\r"

Patients who had received thrombolytic therapy were excluded. Patients were divided into four groups depending on the status of the left anterior descending artery and the presence or absence of a left ventricular aneurysm: Group I (n = 25): aneurysm with occluded left anterior descending artery; Group II (n = 27): no aneurysm and occluded left anterior descending artery; Group III (n = 23): no aneurysm and patent left anterior descending artery; and Group IV (n = 4): aneurysm with patent left anterior descending artery. Single vessel disease was more common in Group I (aneurysm) compared with Groups II and III (no aneurysm) (chi 2(4) = 12.8; probability value equal to 0.012). Collateral blood supply in the presence of an occluded left anterior descending artery was significantly less in Group I (aneurysm) compared with Group II (no aneurysm) (0.9 versus 2.4, p less than 0.001). The extent of coronary artery disease and collateral blood supply in Groups I and II were directly related (p = 0.012). Neither age, sex nor risk factors for coronary disease correlated with aneurysm formation. At a mean follow-up of 48 months, no differences were observed in the incidence of recurrent angina, new myocardial infarction, embolic events or sudden death. More patients in Group II underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. Total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery in association with inherent poor collateral blood supply is a significant determinant of aneurysm formation after anterior myocardial infarction. Multivessel disease with either good collateral circulation or a patent left anterior descending artery is uncommonly associated with the development of left ventricular aneurysm.\r"

Of these, 5 received 0.3 mg (Group 1A) and 11 received 3 mg (Group 1B) intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate, before and 15 minutes after aspirin. Relative to control, 0.3 mg isosorbide dinitrate induced a 19 +/- 9% (mean +/- SD) (p less than 0.01) and 19.5 +/- 11% (p less than 0.01) increase in coronary diameter before and after aspirin, respectively (p = NS). Changes after 3 mg isosorbide were 23 +/- 12% (p less than 0.01) and 26.5 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01), respectively, before and after aspirin (p = NS). In 10 additional patients (Group 2), the effect of the same dose of aspirin on rest coronary artery tone was assessed: changes relative to control were 0.9 +/- 5.5% (p = NS) minutes after aspirin. The intracoronary administration of 3 mg isosorbide dinitrate produced a 24.7 +/- 11% increase in coronary diameter (p = NS versus pre- and postaspirin isosorbide in Group 1B). Urinary 6-ketoprostaglandin-F1 alpha values in urine samples collected in the 8 hours before and the 8 hours after the study in five patients in Group 1B and five patients of Group 2, revealed a 36 +/- 14% (mean +/- SD) reduction in excretion of prostacyclin (p less than 0.01).

No patient was known to have coronary artery spasm. The mean duration of therapy was 4.4 +/- 2 (mean +/- SD) months for nifedipine and 4.3 +/- 2 months for placebo. A restudy angiogram was available in 100 patients (81%) in the nifedipine group and 98 patients (83%) in the placebo group. A recurrent coronary stenosis was noted in 28% of patients in the nifedipine group and in 29.5% of those in the placebo group (p = NS). The mean diameter stenosis was 36.4 +/- 23% for the nifedipine group and 36.7 +/- 23% for the placebo group (p = NS). By pill count, 78% of patients receiving nifedipine and 82% of those receiving placebo complied with the study drug regimen. Coronary stenosis recurred in 33% of patients in the placebo group and in 29% of patients in the nifedipine group who complied with the regimen and had angiograms (p = NS). In conclusion, the study did not demonstrate a significant beneficial effect of nifedipine on the incidence of recurrent stenosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.\r"

All patients were without documented sustained ventricular arrhythmia (sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) before the investigation. Sustained ventricular arrhythmia was induced in two patients on day 5, but in nine on day 24 after infarction. This difference in incidence was statistically significant (p less than 0.05), as was the change in the distribution ratio of induced sustained ventricular arrhythmia from day 5 to day 24 (p less than 0.05). The types of arrhythmia induced on day 24 were sustained ventricular tachycardia with a mean cycle length of 207 ms in six cases (five monomorphic, one polymorphic), and ventricular fibrillation in three cases. These nine patients did not differ from the remaining nine patients in maximal serum creatine kinase, infarct site, number of stenosed coronary arteries, global left ventricular ejection fraction (47 +/- 7% versus 46 +/- 10%) and results of 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring, but they had a significantly shorter right ventricular effective refractory period (223 +/- 10 ms versus 259 +/- 28 ms; p less than 0.05). During the follow-up period of 24 +/-5 months no patient died, had syncopal attacks or developed spontaneous episodes of sustained ventricular arrhythmia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Right atrial pressure and other hemodynamic variables including right ventricular stroke work index were also measured before and after the pericardium was widely opened. The pericardium was grossly normal in all patients and only small physiologic effusions were present. In Group I mean pericardial pressure was 8 +/- 2 mm Hg as was mean right atrial pressure. In Group II mean pericardial pressure was 6 +/- 2 mm Hg versus mean right atrial pressure of 10 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Excluding 2 of the 20 patients with outlying data, pericardial pressure showed linear correlation with right atrial pressure (r = 0.689). In Group I right ventricular stroke work index rose from 5.0 +/- 2.0 to 6.4 +/- 2.1 g-m/m2 (p less than 0.01) after pericardiotomy with no significant increase in mean right atrial pressure; similar findings in Group II were consistent with removal of external constraint. Thus, even in the absence of an abnormal effusion the normal pericardium exerts a significant pressure on the heart, which is often similar in magnitude to right atrial pressure. In certain notable exceptions, however, right atrial pressure far exceeds pericardial pressure. Such pericardial constraint has important implications for ventricular diastolic mechanics.\r"

Left ventricular shape is most dramatically deranged at end-systole and early diastole, suggesting the possibility that the distribution of left ventricular diastolic filling might be altered. To investigate this hypothesis, nine patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and nine normal individuals were studied with echocardiographic techniques. Left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time was significantly prolonged in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension by comparison with normal individuals (129 +/- 36 versus 53 +/- 9 ms, p less than 0.005) and the fraction of the transmitral flow velocity integral occurring in the first half of diastole was significantly less than in normal individuals (38 +/- 14% versus 70 +/- 9%, p less than 0.005). Measurement of fractional changes in short-axis left ventricular cavity area similarly demonstrated that in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension fractional early diastolic cavity expansion (32 +/- 11%) was significantly less than in normal individuals (78 +/- 9%, p less than 0.005). In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, the ventricular septum was abnormally flattened toward the left ventricular cavity at end-systole (normalized septal curvature 0.04 +/- 0.19) and remained that way throughout early diastolic filling but returned toward normal at end-diastole (normalized septal curvature 0.68 +/- 0.19, p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Projected coronary arteriograms were digitized into 512 X 512 pixel mode and percent stenosis was calculated by comparing background-corrected videodensitometric values over stenotic and normal segments. Subjects underwent repeat coronary arteriography because of worsening symptoms of angina or heart failure; subjects with renal failure, coronary artery bypass grafts or cardiac transplant were excluded. Clinical variables determined at the time of the first arteriogram included age, sex, serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and presence or absence of cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus and left ventricular hypertrophy. The mean interval between arteriograms was 29.3 months. Overall progression of coronary stenosis was observed in 40 of the 44 subjects; the mean progression at 24 months was 39% (90% confidence interval, 33 to 45%) and at 36 months was 48% (40 to 56%). The degree of overall progression was related to the length of time between arteriograms (F = 5.81, p less than 0.05) and to serum cholesterol level (F = 4.37, p less than 0.05). These data indicate that using an accurate, quantitative method, it is possible to measure progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis within 2 to 3 years of the initial arteriogram. Serum cholesterol appears to be an important determinant of disease progression.\r"

The diastolic deceleration slope as measured from the continuous wave tracing was significantly different among subgroups of patients with mild (1.6 +/- 0.5 m/s2), moderate (2.7 +/- 0.5 m/s2) and severe (4.7 +/- 1.5 m/s2) aortic insufficiency as determined from aortography. Deceleration slopes greater than 2 m/s2 separated individuals with moderate and severe insufficiency from those with mild insufficiency. Similar findings were seen when comparing the pressure half-time method of diastolic velocity decay with the more severe grades of aortic insufficiency exhibiting the shortest pressure half-times. There was also a high correlation (r = 0.85) between the deceleration slope measured by continuous wave Doppler recordings and the grade of insufficiency as assessed by pulsed Doppler echocardiography. End-diastolic velocities correlated poorly (r = 0.28) with catheter-measured end-diastolic pressure difference between the aorta and the left ventricle. These findings demonstrate that the aortic regurgitant flow pattern by continuous wave Doppler echocardiography may be useful in quantitating the degree of aortic insufficiency by assessing the rate with which aortic and left ventricular pressures equilibrate during diastole.\r"

Scintigraphic measurements included normalized peak filling rate, time to normalized filling rate from both end-diastole and end-systole, diastolic time period and relative diastolic filling during early and atrial filling. Doppler echocardiography and scintigraphy compared favorably in assessment of fractional filling during early diastole (r = 0.84) and atrial systole (r = 0.85), ratio of early to atrial filling (r = 0.83), diastolic filling period (r = 0.94) and interval from end-diastole to peak early diastolic flow (r = 0.88). Normalized peak filling rate and time to normalized peak filling rate from end-systole did not correlate closely by these two techniques. The differences in normalized peak filling rate may be explained by difficulties in estimating mitral anulus cross-sectional area and left ventricular end-diastolic volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During the 6 to 24 hour period, the control group (n = 20) developed ventricular triplets at rates exceeding 270/min. Seven dogs spontaneously developed sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (421 +/- 12 beats/min) at 13 +/- 2 hours. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was present for 38 +/- 8 seconds before ventricular fibrillation developed. One dog developed recurrent monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, with six episodes lasting from 8 to 72 seconds (375 to 425 beats/min). At 24 hours, ventricular pacing produced sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (378 +/- 12 beats/min) in 9 of 13 surviving animals. Nadolol administration 6 hours after coronary artery ligation (n = 19) lowered both the rate (241 +/- 8 versus 328 +/- 8 beats/min; p = 0.001) and the incidence (8 +/- 6 versus 198 +/- 61 per hour; p = 0.004) of rapid ventricular triplets and prevented sudden arrhythmic death (0%; p = 0.005). Nadolol failed to prevent sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (88%; 365 +/- 12 beats/min) produced by ventricular pacing. The data suggest that nadolol prevents spontaneous sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia by selectively suppressing the arrhythmia trigger (rapid ventricular triplets) without altering the underlying arrhythmia substrate.\r"

In the hypokalemia group, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (5 g/kg body weight) was infused into the colon. In both groups, the serum concentrations of sodium, potassium and calcium were measured every 15 minutes for 60 minutes. The mean (+/- standard deviation) serum potassium level of the hypokalemia group decreased significantly from 3.81 +/- 0.21 to 2.92 +/- 0.36 mEq/liter; there were no significant changes in other electrolytes. After 60 minutes, epinephrine (10 micrograms/kg) was injected intravenously in the hypokalemia and control groups, and the arrhythmia ratio (the number of ventricular ectopic beats divided by the total heart rate) was calculated for 5 minutes. Each group was further classified into subgroups of dogs with an arrhythmia ratio higher or lower than 10%. An arrhythmia ratio over 10% was observed in 7.7% of the control group and 53% of the hypokalemia group. Immediately after 5 minutes of epinephrine injection, myocardial mitochondria and plasma membrane fraction were prepared from each group. Mitochondrial calcium content and phospholipase activity of plasma membrane fraction were determined. Significant increases in both mitochondrial calcium content and phospholipase activity were observed in the dogs with hypokalemia and an arrhythmia ratio greater than 10%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The possible adverse effects of a medial tear documented histologically and produced during balloon angioplasty of the common carotid arteries were studied in 30 fully heparinized (100 U/kg body weight) normal pigs. Scanning electron microscopy showed endothelial denudation and extensive platelet deposition in all dilated arterial segments. Visible macroscopic mural thrombus was present within an hour of the procedure in 29 (91%) of the 32 arteries that had a medial tear documented by histologic study; the tear produced an indium-111-labeled platelet deposition of 116.4 +/- 26.5 X 10(6)/cm2 (mean +/- SE) and total thrombotic occlusion in 2 arteries (4%). None of the 24 arteries without a medial tear had a thrombus, and the mean platelet deposition in that group was 7.0 +/- 0.5 X 10(6)/cm2 (p less than 0.0008). In 12 pigs scanned with a gamma camera, visible thrombus was associated with platelet deposition in excess of 20 X 10(6)/cm2 in 12 arteries, 9 of which had a positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram. Thus, arterial angioplasty causes deep arterial injury, which appears to be a major cause of mural thrombosis, heavy platelet deposition, a positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram and acute arterial occlusion. A positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram was always associated with macroscopic thrombus of at least 20 > 10(6) platelets/cm2 and underlying deep arterial injury.\r"

It is not known whether human plaques take up hematoporphyrin derivative in vivo. In five patients undergoing surgical vascular procedures, specimens containing atheromatous plaques were removed and immediately incubated in autologous oxygenated blood at 37 degrees C with hematoporphyrin derivative at a clinically relevant concentration for 2 hours. On exposure to ultraviolet light, porphyrin fluorescence was noted throughout each plaque, whereas adjacent plaque-free tissue showed no fluorescence. To compare in vitro with in vivo hematoporphyrin derivative uptake by plaques, the fluorescence of three types of arterial lesions (induced by a high cholesterol diet, catheters or balloon injury) was studied in 16 New Zealand White rabbits. Each lesion fluoresced selectively with the same intensity whether hematoporphyrin derivative exposure was performed in vitro or in vivo. Fluorescence microscopy did not show a difference in the pattern of hematoporphyrin derivative fluorescence between in vitro and in vivo specimens. The results suggest that human atheromatous plaques should take up hematoporphyrin derivative in vivo and are, therefore, potentially suitable for photochemical treatment as a new therapeutic approach to atherosclerosis.\r"

Single, double and triple truncated exponential shocks separated by 1 ms were delivered through various electrode combinations and cardiac vectors after electrical induction of ventricular fibrillation. A single shock through a pathway not incorporating the interventricular septum (catheter electrodes or epicardial patches between anterior and posterior left ventricle) required the highest total energy (22.6 and greater than 26.4 J, respectively) and peak voltage (1,004 and greater than 1,094 V, respectively) to terminate ventricular fibrillation. A single shock through a pathway including the interventricular septum required lower total energy and peak voltage to defibrillate. Combinations of two sequential shocks between an intracardiac catheter electrode and anterior left ventricular epicardial patch, between the catheter electrode and subcutaneous extrathoracic plate and between three ventricular epicardial patches all significantly reduced total energy (7.7, 8.7 and 7.8 J, respectively) and peak voltage (424, 436 and 424 V, respectively) needed to defibrillate. Three sequential shocks exerted no significant additional reduction in total energy of the defibrillation threshold than did two sequential shocks. Infarcted canine heart required less peak voltage but not total energy to terminate ventricular fibrillation than did noninfarcted heart. Therefore, two sequential shocks over different pathways reduce both total energy and peak voltage required to terminate ventricular fibrillation.\r"

Sixty-three infants underwent coarctation repair by resection between 1960 and 1980, and 62 underwent subclavian angioplasty between 1977 and 1985. The mean age (+/- SEM) at operation for infants with subclavian flap angioplasty was 1.54 +/- 0.93 months and for infants with resection was 2.70 +/- 0.93 months (p = 0.02). There was no difference between the groups in patient weight at initial repair or the proportion of patients with complex anatomy or aortic arch hypoplasia. Follow-up duration for the subclavian flap group was 2.55 +/- 0.51 years (range 0.3 to 8.2), and for the resection group was 7.97 +/- 3.61 years (range 0.6 to 21). Indication for reoperation was the presence of a coarctation gradient at rest of 40 mm Hg or greater and arm hypertension. Reoperation was required in 5 patients in the subclavian flap group and 12 patients in the resection group. The mean reoperation rate after subclavian flap repair was 0.0356 reoperations per patient-year, and after resection was 0.0342 reoperations per patient-year (p = 0.94). To determine an individual's risk of requiring reoperation from these group measures, a reoperation risk model was developed. The risk of reoperation by the fifth postoperative year was found to be 16.3% after subclavian flap repair and 15.7% after resection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In Group I the drainage was infracardiac in nine, supracardiac in seven, intracardiac in eight and mixed in five. In both groups, in those with venous obstruction the flow in the individual pulmonary veins and ascending or descending vein was nonphasic, varying only with respiration. Flow in the absence of obstruction was phasic, varying with the cardiac cycle. Distal to a site of obstruction the flow was nonlaminar and of high velocity irrespective of the amount of pulmonary blood flow. The pulsed Doppler technique provides important physiologic information in the patient with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection before surgical intervention.\r"

Results were compared with similar data from 30 normal children, 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 11 patients with ostium secundum atrial septal defect. In patients with partial AV canal, the portion of total cardiac length occupied by the atrial septum did not differ from normal (24.8 +/- 9.9% versus 28.7 +/- 7.9%, p greater than 0.05), but there was a deficiency of both AV and ventricular septal tissue, the latter occupying only 48.2 +/- 7.0% of total cardiac length (versus 57.9 +/- 4.1% in normal subjects, p less than 0.05). Similarly, patients with complete AV canal had a normal amount of atrial septal tissue, a deficiency of AV septal tissue and a deficiency of ventricular septal tissue which was even greater than that of patients with a partial defect (39.4 +/- 5.0% versus 48.2 +/- 7.0%, p less than 0.05). Thus, although partial AV canal defect is often called ostium primum atrial septal defect, the amount of atrial tissue is usually normal, the defect being formed by a deficiency of AV and ventricular septal tissue. In the complete form of the lesion, the deficiency of ventricular septal tissue is greater.\r"

The diagnosis of specific disease processes has allowed for prenatal intervention by new techniques designed to improve fetal survival. The application of ventricular pacing in a hydropic fetus with complete atrioventricular (AV) block is reported. Complete AV block resulted from maternal collagen vascular disease. The application of ventricular pacing was to allow for further in utero development and for reversal of hydrops fetalis after improvement in cardiac output. Despite fetal death 4 hours after placement of the ventricular pacing lead, this procedure when applied earlier in the development of hydrops may allow for fetal survival. Ventricular pacing was accomplished without apparent trauma to mother or fetus and no evidence of fetal injury was seen at necropsy. Therefore, in the fetus who would otherwise die in utero before the point of viability ex utero, fetal ventricular pacing may be a rational alternative to current observation.\r"

With subsequent balloon angioplasty, the lesion was further decreased to 10% residual stenosis. The entire procedure was well tolerated without chest pain or burning, vessel perforation or spasm, thrombus formation or embolization of debris. The patient was free of pain at 1 month follow-up. This case demonstrates the feasibility of safely performing percutaneous coronary laser thermal angioplasty.

Systemic arterial pressure, left ventricular pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt) and heart rate were comparable in the three animal groups. In the interval between 3 and 10 to 12 months, mean myocyte cell volume per nucleus increased 53 and 26% in the left and the right ventricle, respectively. The total number of myocyte nuclei remained constant in either ventricle. In the following period, between 10 to 12 and 19 to 21 months, a 39% further cellular hypertrophy on the left side of the heart was found in association with an 18% loss of cells in the ventricle. Cell loss was accompanied by discrete areas of interstitial and replacement fibrosis in the subendocardium. In contrast, no myocardial damage was observed in the right ventricle, and the measured 35% additional enlargement of myocytes occurred without a change in cell number. Thus, the aging left ventricle is composed of a smaller number of hypertrophied cells. Cellular hypertrophy may explain the unaltered cardiac function of the aged myocardium.\r"

To assess effects of antihypertensive therapy on the heart, left ventricular mass (determined by echocardiography) and rapid left ventricular filling rate (determined by radionuclide ventriculography) were compared before and after 6 months of treatment of 16 patients. Nitrendipine (a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) was given alone or in combination with either propranolol or hydrochlorothiazide, or both, and significantly reduced blood pressure (156/103 +/- 12/7 to 137/89 +/- 10/6 mm Hg). In 6 of the 16 patients, left ventricular mass decreased by more than 10% (270 +/- 95 to 193 +/- 47 g, p less than 0.01); in the same patients, left ventricular filling rate increased (2.03 +/- 0.35 to 2.30 +/- 0.45 end-diastolic counts/s [EDC/s], p less than 0.01). In the one patient whose left ventricular mass increased (137 to 195 g), left ventricular filling rate decreased from 2.01 to 1.78 EDC/s. In the remaining nine patients who had no change in left ventricular mass, there was no significant changes in left ventricular filling. The changes in ventricular mass and filling could not be related to the extent of change in blood pressure or heart rate. These data suggest that regression of left ventricular mass during antihypertensive therapy with nitrendipine is accompanied by improved diastolic function.\r"

The study was conducted double-blind on 2 days, 1 week apart, using a placebo-controlled crossover design. On each day, measurements at rest were made before and 20 minutes after 20 mg sublingual nifedipine or placebo and were followed by measurements made during exercise. Compared with placebo, nifedipine reduced mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance, and increased heart rate and cardiac output at rest and during exercise. It did not alter mean pulmonary artery or pulmonary artery wedge pressures at rest, but decreased them during exercise. Nifedipine decreased arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) from 96 +/- 10 to 90 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) at rest and from 99 +/- 11 to 92 +/- 12 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) at submaximal exercise (33 +/- 21 W), but did not alter it (100 +/- 12 versus 100 +/- 16 mm Hg, p = NS) at maximal exercise (68 +/- 30 W).

  ".W": "Fifty ragweed-sensitive subjects were each administered a course of 12 injections of polyethylene glycol-modified ragweed extract. To investigate the effect of two treatment regimens, subjects were paired according to their skin sensitivity to ragweed extract and the severity of their rhinoconjunctivitis the previous year. One of each pair was randomly allocated to receive injections at weekly intervals, and the other subject was to receive injections daily until a local or systemic adverse reaction occurred and then to switch to a weekly schedule for the rest of the course. Blood was obtained immediately before each injection and at the end of the study to examine the rates of change of ragweed-specific IgE and IgG antibody levels and to evaluate whether these or other variables could be used to predict the occurrence of adverse reactions. Immediate reactions were minimal in both groups, but more late reactions occurred in subjects receiving the modified rush regimen; therefore, although the total number of injections received by the two groups was similar, the total dose of protein injected in the rush group was only half that achieved in the weekly group. Treatment induced increases in ragweed-specific IgE and IgG antibodies in both groups; the increase in IgE was similar in the two groups, but the increase in IgG was higher in the weekly group. There was a marked decrease in skin sensitivity to ragweed extract after treatment that was directly related to the IgG antibody response, and therefore, these changes were greater in the weekly group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ten adult volunteers were tested on two separate occasions. Their noses were pretreated by oral administration of either combined H1 and H2 histamine antagonists or H1 antagonist and placebo. The nasal airflow resistive response to topical histamine was then determined. Combined histamine antagonism was significantly more effective in reducing the nasal resistive response to topical histamine than H1 antagonist alone (p less than 0.0001). Furthermore, ingestion of the oral H1 histamine antagonist, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, alone led to an increase in resistance of the unprovoked nose, whereas combined H1 and H2 antagonism did not lead to a significant change.\r"

Efficacy was evaluated by symptom scores, concomitant antihistamine use, and suppression of histamine- and codeine-induced wheal response. Doxepin-treated subjects experienced fewer lesions (p less than 0.001), less waking hours with lesions (p less than 0.01), lesser degree of itch and/or discomfort (p less than 0.001), and less swelling or angioedema (p less than 0.001) as compared to placebo-treated subjects. Doxepin-treated subjects required less daily concomitant antihistamine use (mean 0.13 tablets versus 1.48 tablets, p less than 0.05). Doxepin also significantly suppressed histamine- and codeine-induced cutaneous wheal response as compared to placebo. Lethargy was commonly observed but diminished with continued use. Dry mouth and constipation were also commonly observed. We conclude that doxepin is an effective agent for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria.\r"

In contrast, we found that 16 patients with CSD had significantly increased lymphocyte transformation responses to cat-scratch antigen when patients were compared to control subjects. This cell-mediated immune response may be directed against nonviable bacteria in the involved lymph nodes and may be the major mechanism responsible for the granulomatous reaction and clinical features of CSD.\r"

Lymphedema was first noticed in the patient at 3 years of age, and pleural effusions developed 7 years later. Thoracentesis demonstrated that the right pleural fluid was yellow, clear, and had the composition of lymph. The left pleural fluid was milky and had a higher triglyceride and lymphocyte content than the right pleural fluid. Complete removal of pleural fluid transiently increased total lung capacity to a maximum of 52% predicted. Strict dietary management with a low-fat and high-protein diet resulted in a transient partial reversal of circulating lymphopenia and low T cell concentration. This was accompanied by a decrease in lymphocyte and T cell concentration in the pleural fluid. Unstimulated mononuclear cells from pleural fluid synthesized increased amounts of DNA, and added mitogens or antigens further increased DNA synthesis. Dietary therapy had a minimal effect on this DNA synthesis. Despite circulating hypogammaglobulinemia, normal antibody activity was detected. The proportion of B cells in pleural fluid was greater than that in the circulation, and dietary therapy did not alter this difference. Pulmonary physiology improved during the initial 9-month period of diet therapy, but then the rate of fluid accumulation increased, causing respiratory compromise. Stability was achieved by a right-sided pleurodesis, followed 18 months later by a left pleurodesis with the addition of a shunt to provide internal lymph drainage.\r"

  ".U": "87058574\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of parental smoking on IgE and IgD levels in cord serum and subsequent infant allergy were investigated in an unselected series of 186 European newborn infants. Maternal smoking caused a significant rise in both IgE (p less than 0.05) and IgD (p less than 0.05), a finding that was most apparent in newborn infants with a negative biparental history of allergy (p less than 0.025 and p = 0.005, respectively). Furthermore, newborn infants of nonallergic parents had a more than threefold (p less than 0.01) higher incidence of elevated cord IgE (greater than or equal to 1.20 IU/ml) and a fourfold (p = 0.005) higher risk of developing definite or probable atopic disease before 18 months of age if the mother smoked than if she did not. Paternal smoking did not influence, in whatever the subgroup, cord IgE or subsequent infant allergy but increased cord IgD (p less than 0.001) among newborn infants with a negative family history even after controlling for maternal smoking (p less than 0.04). These results suggest that parental smoking in some way affects the fetal immune system, probably via substances in tobacco smoke. Maternal smoking in particular appears to exert a pronounced effect on the IgE system already in fetal life, predisposing even \"low-risk\" infants to subsequent sensitization, probably in synergy with a later acquired mucosal damage that would facilitate penetration of foreign matter. Pregnant women and mothers should be encouraged to try and give up smoking that might help to prevent allergic disease in their infants.\r"

Pentamidine administration produced fever, severe myositis, and clinical deterioration, and therefore, desensitization to TMS was attempted. This was done with low doses of oral suspension and then intravenous administration during a period of 60 hours. The patient reacted with fevers, arthralgia, and erythema that cleared 4 days after the desensitization was completed. This single case of successful desensitization to TMS in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome suggests that the oral route may be useful in similar situations when this drug is urgently needed.\r"

The inflammatory cell infiltrate in this reaction contained large numbers of basophils and eosinophils with accompanying neutrophils and monocytes. Ocular tissue can serve as a priming site for systemic immunization and also for elicitation of a secondary flare after challenge with antigen. Very few inflammatory cells were observed in the cutaneous epithelium of either primary or secondary flares. In contrast, the mucosal stroma and epithelium contained large numbers of inflammatory cells (basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils), suggesting directed cellular movement onto the ocular surface. The lesion of ocular basophil hypersensitivity in the guinea pig has features in common with two human eye diseases, vernal conjunctivitis and contact lens-associated giant papillary conjunctivitis. We hypothesize that the acute basophil hypersensitivity reactions of the conjunctiva are transformed into chronic inflammatory and proliferative states in vernal conjunctivitis and giant papillary conjunctivitis.\r"

  ".U": "87058580\r", 
  ".W": "Because mast cells (MCs) in skin of atopic dogs are heterogeneous with respect to tissue fixation and staining properties, we determined the effect of antigen on each type of MC in vivo. Skin biopsies were done in anesthetized, ragweed-sensitized dogs before and at 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours after intradermal injections of ragweed antigen (n = 5) or glycerin diluent (n = 4). In each case, one biopsy specimen was fixed with formalin, and a second specimen from an adjacent abdominal site was fixed with basic lead acetate. In sections stained with Alcian blue, 49.7% more MCs (p less than 0.05) were detected in tissue fixed with basic lead acetate (\"typical\" plus \"atypical\" MCs: 2916 +/- 581/mm3; mean +/- SEM) than in tissue fixed with formalin (\"typical\" MCs: 1955 +/- 537/mm3). After antigen, the number of \"typical\" MCs detectable in tissue sections progressively decreased during the 24-hour period, whereas the number of \"atypical\" MCs was lowest at 1 hour and had increased at 24 hours. After diluent, MC numbers did not change significantly over time. A late-phase response (LPR), detected clinically as induration and edema, was present 6 hours after antigen in four of five dogs, but LPR was not detected after diluent. The size of LPR was correlated (r = 0.85; p less than 0.05) with the decrease in the number of \"typical\" MCs at 6 hours. We conclude that the response of the \"typical\" and \"atypical\" MC to antigen in vivo differs markedly. The \"atypical\" MCs participate in the early, acute response to antigen, and the \"typical\" MCs may be associated with the development of the LPR.\r"

  ".W": "It is evident that asthma and the other allergic diseases constitute a health problem of international scope. There is a need for well-designed, large-scale, prospective epidemiologic studies designed to define precisely the magnitude of the worldwide problem created by allergic disorders. Most studies to date have been small and have involved special groups rather than the entire population. With the exception of data reported from developing countries, prevalence rates for childhood asthma are noted to be both increasing and higher than adult rates. While exact reasons are not known, the state of development of immune system regulation and hyperreactivity to allergens encountered in early life may play a role. Whether the actual prevalence and incidence of allergic diseases in children are increasing or whether this observation represents a phenomenon resulting from improved diagnostic methods and recognition of these disorders needs to be established. Paradoxically, despite advances in treatment, the severity of asthma and allergic diseases appears to be increasing. Accordingly, it is especially important to search for the factors that lead to the expression of immune and hypersensitivity mechanisms. Differences in rural and urban populations appear to be real and suggest the need to examine the factors of indoor and outdoor environments created by air pollution, crowding, and allergen exposure and the demands made on the immune system by frequency of challenge by respiratory tract infections. Still among the unknowns is the effect on the natural history of allergic disease after changes in urban-rural residences in countries in which helminth infections are not hyper IgE-stimulating factors. The creation of new occupationally related allergens at worksites and the contribution of industrialization to the deterioration of the natural environment needs to be adequately assessed. Whether breast feeding may have an effect on either the prevention or delayed emergence of food allergies in children requires documentation by long-term prospective studies based on objective testing. A possible relationship between respiratory tract infection and the development of asthma is exemplified by clinical observations. The emergence of asthma in infants increases with successive episodes of bronchiolitis; triggering of asthmatic attacks by acute respiratory tract viral infections is a common occurrence, especially during childhood years; and chronic adult onset asthma is often preceded or accompanied by chronic sinusitis or complicated by lower respiratory tract infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In a cross-sectional survey of 652 workers in a western red-cedar sawmill, we obtained data on symptoms, pulmonary function, immediate skin reactivity to common allergens, nonspecific bronchial responsiveness, total IgE level, and sensitization to plicatic acid conjugated with human serum albumin as measured by RAST. Dust exposure was estimated by personal and area sampling for total dust during a work shift and cumulative exposure by duration of employment. Seven percent of the workers had an elevated RAST, and 20% had nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Elevation in RAST was associated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Almost half (46%) of the workers with RAST elevation had bronchial hyperresponsiveness compared to 18% in workers with no RAST elevation. The association was unaffected by total IgE level or by limiting the analysis to workers without respiratory symptoms and was most apparent in younger workers. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was associated with increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms as well as with lower levels of pulmonary function. The likelihood of bronchial hyperresponsiveness increased with increasing age but was unrelated to the dust-exposure concentration. RAST elevation was unrelated to employment duration or dust exposure and was not associated with an increased prevalence of symptoms or lower levels of pulmonary function independent of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. We conclude that plicatic acid-specific IgE and nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness are associated in western red-cedar workers and that this association may reflect a causal connection.\r"

The occurrence of both phenomena in the same patient made it possible to study cross-reactivity patterns of potato antigens. An 11-year-old girl, exclusively breast-fed for her first 4 months, developed anaphylactic symptoms after ingestion of potato at 5 months of age when she was fed potato for the first time. Subsequently, she developed urticaria, angioedema, and respiratory and systemic symptoms on contact with potatoes, ingestion of potatoes, and exposure to cooking potatoes or potato pollen. Three allergenic extracts from potato pulp, peel, and pollen were prepared. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isoelectrofocusing of the three extracts were performed. IgE-mediated allergy to these extracts was demonstrated by means of immediate skin test reactivity, positive passive transfer, RAST, RAST inhibition, and leukocyte histamine release. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the pulp extract followed by electroblotting and autoradiography demonstrated specific IgE antibodies directed against several proteins ranging from 14,000 to 40,000 daltons.\r"

Rocket immunoelectrophoresis for C4d is a sensitive assay for C4 activation in plasma. We have evaluated the value of this assay in identifying patients with C1-inhibitor deficiency. C4 activation was assessed in the plasmas of 15 patients with hereditary angioedema, five patients with variant form of hereditary angioedema, and four patients with acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency. Control groups consisted of 27 patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria and/or angioedema and seven normal volunteers. C4 activation was detected in all 52 plasma samples collected from the 24 patients with C1-inhibitor deficiency. The degree of C4 activation increased during attacks of angioedema and decreased (but remained elevated) during treatment with attenuated androgens. The concentrations of C4, C2, and C1 inhibitor were also measured; however, none of these measurements identified all of the patients with C1-inhibitor deficiency. Thus, we conclude that the measurement of C4 activation is one of the best tests available to evaluate a patient for C1-inhibitor deficiency, and a normal result will exclude the diagnosis of C1-inhibitor deficiency.\r"

In addition, histamine levels were significantly more elevated in sites challenged with compound 48/80 than in unstimulated sites. Patients with CU differed from normal volunteers in that histamine release induced by 48/80 compound was significantly greater at 1 and 2 hours after challenge. The number of mast cells and the histamine content of the skin did not differ in the two groups. These observations could suggest a functional defect at the mast cell level rather than a difference in their numbers.\r"

In each challenge, the wine was administered in stepwise increasing quantities until a total of 385 ml or a fall in peak expiratory flow of greater than 15% was reached. Nine subjects demonstrated a significant fall in peak flow in one or more challenges. In all cases the most severe reaction was observed after the wine with high SO2 content. The study suggests that SO2 is the most important factor in red wine-induced asthma. It is recommended that wine labels provide information on the SO2 content.\r"

The provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) was obtained after each test. On days 2, 3, and 4, after baseline spirometry, active and placebo ascorbic acid (2 gm) was administered orally, double-blind, according to a 4.3.1 two-treatment crossover study design. One hour later, spirometry was performed, and PC20 was reassessed. We found no significant changes in FEV1 and FVC after ascorbic acid as compared with placebo administration. There was no difference between PC20 on days 2, 3, and 4 and by standardizing for the four PC20 results obtained on day 1. We conclude that ascorbic acid has no acute bronchodilator effect and does not alter bronchial responsiveness to histamine in subjects with asthma.\r"

  ".W": "The plasma concentrations of epinephrine were determined in healthy subjects administered epinephrine by subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mg or inhalation of 1.5 to 4.5 mg (10 to 30 inhalations from a metered-dose aerosol). The absorption of injected epinephrine was variable and in several cases very slow. The individual maximum values for epinephrine in plasma were 4.65 +/- 1.09 (range 0.74 to 8.31) nmol/L, and these maxima were attained 5 to 120 minutes after injection. Inhaled epinephrine was rapidly and dose dependently absorbed. Ten inhalations resulted in 2.72 +/- 0.84 (0.75 to 5.67) nmol/L within 5 minutes and 20 inhalations resulted in 7.19 +/- 1.78 (2.10 to 13.83) nmol/L with rapid increases and maxima within 20 minutes in seven of eight subjects. Gastrointestinal side effects were dose limiting when epinephrine was administered by inhalation. Our results indicate that inhalation of 2 to 3 mg of epinephrine produces rapid increases of epinephrine concentrations in plasma to levels that have previously been demonstrated to counteract bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled allergen in subjects with asthma. Inhalation has several advantages over injection for self-administration of epinephrine, e.g., in patients who are allergic to insect (Hymenoptera) stings. Apart from the absorption being more rapid, the locally high concentrations of epinephrine in the airways should be advantageous, since bronchoconstriction is one of the life-threatening phenomena of the anaphylactic reaction. This route of administration is also simple for the patient.\r"

  ".W": "A 58-year-old subject with a history of occupational asthma to red-cedar sawdust underwent specific inhalation challenges with this product. Significant increases in airway responsiveness to histamine (tenfold fall in PC20 FEV1) were documented 7 hours after exposure for 5 minutes to red cedar while baseline spirometry remained unchanged. A dual asthmatic reaction was induced during the following days by exposing the subject to red-cedar sawdust for 30 minutes and plicatic acid for 7 minutes. After recovery of PC20, the subject was reexposed to plicatic acid for 15 and 30 seconds on 2 consecutive days. No significant changes in FEV1, forced vital capacity, and residual volume were demonstrated in the following 8 hours, although minimal changes in forced expiratory flow rate between 25% and 75% of FVC were observed. PC20 dropped significantly and required 2 weeks to recover. This example illustrates that bronchial hyperresponsiveness to histamine can precede the changes in airway caliber after an antigen challenge. It also demonstrates that such changes can persist for up to 2 weeks after the challenge, even when no significant changes in FEV1 are induced.\r"

  ".W": "In a stratified random sample of 320 white adults, the prevalence of puncture skin test positivity (ST +) to Lolium perenne (rye grass)-pollen extract (LPE) was 16%. Fifteen percent of all subjects (or 84% of subjects classified LPE IgE antibody positive [Ab +]) was classified IgE Ab + to highly purified Lol p I (Rye I), and 4% of all subjects (or 26% of subjects classified LPE IgE Ab +) was classified IgE Ab + to highly purified Lol p II (Rye II). These data and similar results obtained in an allergy-enriched group of 361 subjects are consistent with previous studies that Lol I is a major allergen and Lol II is a minor allergen of LPE. Whether we studied LPE, Lol I, or Lol II, responder subjects were younger than nonresponder subjects and more male than female subjects were responders. We then investigated the quantitative interrelationships among ST, IgE, and IgG Ab responsiveness to LPE, Lol I, and Lol II in the allergy-enriched group. For each allergen, log-log correlations were strong and significant for ST versus IgE Ab and for IgE Ab versus IgG Ab. All subjects IgE Ab + to Lol I or Lol II were IgG Ab + to that allergen, supporting other evidence for a commonality in the genetic control influencing the production of IgE and IgG Abs to a given allergen. Log-log correlations among ST end points, IgE Ab levels, or IgG Ab levels were strong for LPE versus either Lol I or Lol II but weak between Lol I and Lol II, consistent with the reported lack of cross-reactivity between Lol I and Lol II. Despite these findings, almost all Lol II + subjects were Lol I + by ST (98%), IgE Ab (91%), and IgG Ab (83%), suggesting that the Ia-restricted immune recognition of both these molecules is at least in part under a common genetic control.\r"

This study quantitated the influence of weight gain on birth weight and identified rates and total amounts of weight gain related to the birth of healthy-sized infants to healthy low-income women who entered pregnancy underweight, at normal weight, overweight, or obese. Data used in the study were obtained from randomly sampled prenatal health records from Maternal and Infant Care (MIC) projects in Cleveland and Minneapolis. Subsamples of healthy mothers who delivered healthy-sized infants were identified from each sample, and rates and total amounts of weight gain by prepregnancy weight status group were calculated. There were 384 healthy mother and healthy-sized infant pairs in the Cleveland subsample and 75 such pairs in the Minneapolis sample. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the influence of prenatal weight gain and birth weight varied depending on prepregnancy weight status. Prenatal weight gains related to the birth of healthy-sized infants (newborns with birth weights of 3,000 to 4,500 gm) to healthy mothers in the Cleveland MIC sample averaged 33 lb for underweight, 32 lb for normal weight, 29 lb for overweight, and 19 lb for obese women. Except for obese women, rates and total amount of weight gain associated with the birth of healthy-sized infants were equivalent for the two samples.\r"

Demographic and opinion data were requested, and knowledge of the food habits of the six largest ethnic groups in the state was tested. California colleges and universities offering ADA Plan IV programs were sent questionnaires regarding the goals, content, and methodology of and the enrollment in cultural foods courses. Results of the dietitian survey (no. = 184; response rate 51%) showed a positive association (p less than .05) between the total score on the cultural foods knowledge test (average score = 62% correct) and completion of a college cultural foods course. Results of the Plan IV program survey (no. = 16; response rate 93%) indicate that 86% of the colleges and universities offer at least one cultural foods course. In 53% of those colleges and universities, Plan IV students are required to take such a course. Course content corresponds well to needs identified in the answers to the dietitian questionnaire.

We have determined that by comparison with young subjects, the elderly controls have compromised although functionally effective balance. On the other hand, the balance response was severely compromised in half of the individuals with a history of falls. Experience with the Postural Stress Test suggests it will predict those elderly individuals with a tendency to fall as well as provide a simple mechanism for studying the balance response in the elderly.\r"

The FAI is a structured interview followed by a rating process which compares patient status against standard descriptive phrases. Patients are assessed in five areas: mental health, physical health, social resources, economic resources, and activities of daily living (ADL). The validity of the FAI was tested by comparing ratings of patient health obtained by a single investigator using only the instrument with ratings obtained by consensus from an interdisciplinary home care team providing long-term care for the patients studied. An excellent level of agreement (weighted kappas from .583 to .780) was found in all areas studied. A single significant difference in ADL rating with a high correlation coefficient (r = .85) was interpreted as due to a difference between the single rater and the team in the definition of ADL. The ease of obtaining summary ratings from clinical personnel suggests that further exploration of this rapid quantification of patient health is warranted.\r"

In the authors' sample of 131 DAT subjects, 41 (31%) also met DMS-III criteria for a major affective disorder. Of those DAT plus depression patients whose records reflected treatment (usually with a tricyclic antidepressant), 85% (17 of 20) showed clear evidence of improvement in mood, vegetative signs, or activities of daily living (ADLs) based on review of the medical record. An analysis of change in cognitive function (measured by the Folstein Mini-Mental State) and five global measures failed to reveal any differences between the depressed and nondepressed groups after a mean interval of 17 months. The depression that occurs in approximately one-quarter to one-third of DAT patients appears to respond to appropriate therapy. These patients often show improvement in their mood and ADLs but remain demented.\r"

Using chart review and interviews with the residents, it was found that multiple physical factors, including pain, strength, endurance, vision and balance, and multiple social and environmental factors, including the fear of falling, were related to the resident's decision to use a wheelchair as an alternative means of mobility. A physical examination focused on aspects of mobility was completed on each resident and was intended to characterize the physical limitations in groups studied. In the nursing home environment, use of the wheelchair is viewed by the residents as a self-initiated choice which the residents believed significantly enhanced their sense of well-being. Finally, there was minimal recognition of mobility as a problem on the part of the medical and nursing staff. The study raises a number of important issues concerning walking versus wheelchair use in the nursing home.\r"

Overall autopsy rate was 36%. Autopsy rates declined sharply with age from 60% for those aged 16 to 34 years to 23% for those 85 and over (P less than .001). The highest rates by diagnosis were aortic aneurysm (70%), hepatic failure (52%), heart rhythm disturbance (48%), pulmonary embolism (45%), and sepsis (41%). Patients receiving major procedures had a significantly higher autopsy rate (38 versus 29%, P less than .05) but rates bore little relation to prognoses given at admission by house officers, suddenness of death, sex, marital status or year of admission. Even among intensively treated patients, autopsy rates decline strikingly with age, demanding honest re-appraisal to restore the place of autopsy in medical education, clinical research, and quality of care assessment for an increasingly elderly population.\r"

The parameters reviewed included age, home situation, diagnosis, incidence of co-existent medical disorders, management by the social worker, nurses and neuropsychiatrist, the extent of social and program participation, length of stay, and disposition. There was a high incidence of medical problems which were managed effectively because of close nursing observation, availability of ancillary services, specialty clinics, and frequent communication with the community physicians. The social worker assisted families with the management of long-term planning for the dementia patients and the entire social-nursing-recreational therapy team devised programs which encouraged the patients to function at an optimum level. Neuropsychiatric management, including drug therapy, was an integral part of the program. Despite the fact that the dementia patients were at high risk, with an average age of 81 years the average duration of attendance was two years four months and only nine of the 34 patients ultimately required nursing home placement. It was concluded that the day care program served as a resource which devised, integrated, and supervised, in cooperation with the community physicians, the support network and management strategies for the dementia patients.\r"

The disease is frequently characterized by cardiac, gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. As hyperthyroidism is readily amenable to effective treatment that can improve the quality of life, the clinical suspicion of this disease is always indicated and exclusion of this diagnosis should always be pursued. Recognizing the admittedly great difficulty in making, or even suspecting, the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in the elderly, our rule is to test for hyperthyroidism in essentially all geriatric patients presenting chronic systemic symptoms or signs. On the other hand, we do not recommend community-wide screening of persons over 60 for hyperthyroidism. Community-wide screening falls far below the break-even point in cost-benefit analysis. The most sensible detector of hyperthyroidism now widely available is the serum free T3 index (FT3I), but it may be falsely normal because of the effect of systemic illness on extrathyroidal T4-to-T3 conversion. The advent of ultrasensitive methods for TSH may change these statements considerably. It may become the single screening procedure for both hyper- and hypothyroidism.\r"

Increased cholinesterase activity was observed in nonobese as well as obese patients with fatty liver, whereas obese subjects without fatty liver showed levels in the upper normal range. When we set a cutoff level above the upper normal limit, half of the patients with fatty liver showed values above it, with only a few overlaps with other patients. When obese patients with fatty liver took a low-caloric diet, cholinesterase activity decreased, clearly reflecting improvement of hepatic steatosis. Thus, measurement of cholinesterase activity is of diagnostic value and an alternative to computed tomography in hepatic steatosis, and will provide a practical measure for the assessment of effects during follow-up.\r"

This effect appears to be specific for the alpha 1-receptor. To determine the effect of this drug on vascular permeability to serum proteins and inflammatory cells, leakage of serum proteins into the central nervous system (CNS) was measured with [125I]albumin, and quantitation of cellular inflammation was determined by an estimation of total DNA. The results show that in both actively induced and passively transferred models of the disease, treatment with prazosin significantly suppresses leakage of serum proteins into the CNS but does not significantly suppress the increase of DNA. The results of the [125I]albumin studies additionally support the conclusion that the extent of vascular permeability to serum proteins in the spinal cord is a significant correlate of clinical disease. The results of the DNA estimation were at variance with the histologic evidence of cellular infiltration. We conclude that treatment with prazosin has a significant effect on the development of vascular edema in EAE. These results additionally validate a role for the adrenergic receptor in the development of EAE, and support the hypothesis that the primary site of action of prazosin is on the vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptor.\r"

Moreover, in both man and mice, IgG antibodies to polysaccharides are predominantly, but not exclusively, restricted to a single IgG subclass--IgG2 in man, and IgG3 in the mouse. Because CBA/N mice have a deficiency of IgG3 antibodies and because human IgG2 subclass deficiencies have been generally associated with inability to produce antibodies to carbohydrate antigens, it would seem likely that patients with WAS would have greatly reduced levels of IgG2. Quite to the contrary, the data presented here demonstrate that WAS patients have normal levels of the different IgG subclasses, including IgG2. Thus, inability to produce antibodies to carbohydrates is not always associated with IgG2 subclass deficiency.\r"

This study describes the potent in vivo effect of pertussigen on the levels of antigen-specific macrophage-activating lymphokine(s); lymphokine(s) was measured by the stimulation of macrophage procoagulant activity (mPCA), or plasminogen activator (PA) activity. Lymphoid cells were removed from immunized animals and cultured with specific antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, ovalbumin, or human gamma-globulin. The culture supernatants were then incubated with the monocyte-like cell line WEHI-265 to measure mPCA or with WEHI-265 or resident peritoneal macrophages to measure PA activity. Mice were given pertussigen at the time of immunization, and the subsequent generation by lymphocyte supernatants of both of these macrophage activities proved to be greatly enhanced; the effect of pertussigen was antigen specific. Pertussigen thus induces an increase in lymphokine(s) production responsible for the in vitro increase in macrophage mPCA and PA activity and which may be responsible for some of the potent immune effects of this agent in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Human IgG4 antibodies directed against phospholipase A, the P1 antigen from Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus extracts, and cat albumin were found unable to cross-link antigen. Previously, it was demonstrated that IgG4 antibodies, in contrast to IgG1 antibodies, did not cross-link Sepharose-bound antigen and antigen added in solution. To eliminate the possibility that this phenomenon was caused by preferential binding of both IgG4 Fab fragments to the solid-phase-bound antigen, cross-linking of antigen was studied in a fluid-phase system. In this test, incapability of IgG4 antibodies to bridge two antigens was also found. As a result of such a phenomenon, it is expected that immune complexes formed by IgG4 antibodies will be considerably smaller than complexes formed by IgG1. This was confirmed by analysis of the molecular size profiles of IgG1- and IgG4-containing immune complexes in sucrose-density gradients. Moreover, IgG1 was able to precipitate antigen in a radioimmunoprecipitation test, whereas precipitation was not demonstrable by the same amount of IgG4 antibodies. Even 3% polyethylene glycol 8,000 did not precipitate the small IgG4-containing immune complexes efficiently. The antibodies studied were of a high-affinity type, and there was no significant difference in association constants between IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies. Therefore, we were not able to confirm observations reported in the literature that the IgG4 subclass is associated with a low-affinity antibody response; probably, the affinity of the IgG4 antibodies was underestimated by other investigators because of the polyethylene glycol precipitation technique used to separate antibody-bound and free antigen. Our findings stress the point that IgG4 antibodies take a special place in the immune response upon chronic exposure to antigen.\r"

Fourteen hybridomas producing antibody against TSST-1 were isolated independently. The culture supernatant and ascitic fluids from each were analyzed to determine the mAb isotypes. Seven of the mAb were IgG1, and the remaining seven were IgM; all the mAb had kappa light chains. Immunoglobulin was partially purified from hybridoma-generated ascitic fluid by ammonium sulfate precipitation and tested for the ability to block TSST-1-induced mitogenicity and immunosuppression. Three mAb (all IgG1) were shown to block both the toxin-induced mitogenicity and the suppression. None of the mAb tested inhibited just one of the two toxin activities. The neutralizing mAb were then used in Western analysis with previously mapped cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-generated toxin fragments to localize the aforementioned biologic functions. The Western blot analysis showed that the mitogenic and the suppressive functions of TSST-1 were located on a 14,000 dalton internal CNBr fragment.\r"

Two parasite molecules have been implicated in the attachment event: Leishmania lipopolysaccharide (L-LPS) and a glycoprotein (gp63). This study was designed to clarify the role of L-LPS in infection and the stage in the process of infection at which it operates. We have recently identified a Leishmania major strain (LRC-L119) which lacks the L-LPS molecule and is not infective for hamsters or mice. This parasite was isolated from a gerbil in Kenya and was identified phenotypically as L. major by isoenzyme and fatty acid analysis. In this study we have confirmed at the genotype level that LRC-L119 is L. major by analyzing and comparing the organization of cloned DNA sequences in the genome of different strains of L. major. Here we show that LRC-L119 promastigotes are phagocytosed rapidly by macrophages in vitro, but in contrast to virulent strains of L. major, they are then killed over a period of 18 hr. In addition, we show that transfer of purified L-LPS from a virulent clone of L. major (V121) into LRC-L119 promastigotes confers on them the ability to survive in macrophages in vitro.\r"

We reasoned that cyclosporine A (CsA), by opposing these immune responses, could suppress the ENL reaction and restore patients to the quiescent lepromatous state. We tested this hypothesis in vitro by measuring the effect of CsA on M. leprae-triggered suppressor cells. In 24 of 25 patients with ENL, suppressor cell activity was restored by CsA. The target of CsA appeared to be macrophages. These findings are significant in that they provide the first evidence for the potential efficacy of CsA in the treatment of ENL. Preliminary clinical trials indicate a beneficial therapeutic effect associated with increased T suppressor cells in lesions.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously identified and described two distinct types of suppressor T cell factors specific for the PFC response to L-glutamic acid60-L-alanine30-L-tyrosine10 (GAT) or L-glutamic acid50-L-tyrosine50 (GT). Both of these factors are antigen-specific and I-J+. GAT-TsF1 is not MHC-restricted and is composed of a single polypeptide chain, whereas GAT-TsF2 is MHC-restricted and is composed of two different polypeptide chains. We have not previously found evidence for an obligatory, idiotype-specific suppressor T cell in this suppressor pathway. However, we now report that idiotype-specific suppressor T cells can be elicited by exposing normal spleen cells to GAT-TsF1 or GAT-TsF2 in the absence of antigen in vitro. These factor (TsF1/TsF2)-induced cells have been fused with the AKR thymoma, BW5147, and hybridomas were selected for production of suppressor factors that inhibit GAT-specific antibody responses in vitro. In this report, we characterize one monoclonal factor from each fusion. Neither factor binds GAT or the related co-polymer, GT; both factors have binding sites for GAT-specific idiotypes but not for unrelated idiotypes either in the form of antibody immobilized on Sepharose or as cell surface determinants expressed by B cell hybridomas. Moreover, their reactivities for a panel of monoclonal anti-GAT antibodies are overlapping but not identical. Both factors are composed of two polypeptide chains, and both chains are required for suppressive activity; one chain bears the I-J determinant, whereas the other possesses the idiotype-binding activity of the intact molecule. Both idiotype-binding factors are restricted by MHC- and Igh-linked genes, and transcomplementation is observed in the F1 mice between MHC-congenic and Igh-congenic parents. Both factors are active late in Mishell-Dutton cultures. These data support the contention that these two factors are similar but nonidentical members of an anti-idiotypic class of GAT-specific suppressor factors.\r"

Spleen cells from these mice have decreased NK-1.1+ cells and null (Thy-1- and B220-) cells. Their splenic NK activity to YAC targets was low and was not enhanced by IFN-alpha or IFN-beta. Bone marrow (BM) of these NK-1.1(-) mice have normal precursors to NK cells: 1) NK activity could be generated from NK-1.1(-) BM cells cultured in rIL 2 for 5 to 6 days. These cultured BM cells expressed Qa-5, Thy-1, AsGm-1, and NK-1.1 antigens. The precursor cells of these BM cytotoxic cells are NK-1.1-; 2) transfer of BM cells from the NK-1.1(-) mice reconstituted the NK activity of irradiated, NK-depleted recipients. Lymphokine-activated killer cells could also be generated from spleens of these NK-1.1(-) mice. Therefore, the NK-1.1(-) mice were specifically depleted of mature cytotoxic NK cells, but not the NK-1.1- precursors of NK cells. This mouse model is valuable to study ontogeny and physiologic relevance of NK cells.\r"

These results are compared with similar observations in college students with an acute, febrile, noninfluenzal respiratory illness that occurred during the same outbreak. The lymphopenia typical of influenza during acute illness was shown to be due to a reduction in both T and B cells without alteration in the CD4:CD8 ratio. In addition, phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A responses were reduced and NKC activity was increased, while pokeweed mitogen reactivity was unaltered at the time of admission to the study. Patients with noninfluenzal illness showed early polymorphonuclear leukocytosis and a similar lymphopenia. Lymphocyte functions were virtually unchanged during acute illness in noninfluenza patients. The relatively specific alterations in lymphocyte responses to lectin-induced stimulation in influenza patients may indicate that the peripheral T cells are incapable of activation via the CD3 or CD2 activation pathways. In addition, increased NKC activity in the periphery may be reflective of increased NKC activity in the lung. Influenza-infected individuals with higher NKC activity at the time of admission to the study also took longer to recover. Finally, the early lymphopenia and the later neutropenia in the influenza-infected patient may represent migration of these cells from the circulation to the infected respiratory tract as a consequence of infection.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to find naturally occurring anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies to anti-human thyroglobulin (anti-hTg) idiotype in sera of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. Sera from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), Graves' disease (GD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and sera from normal subjects were tested for the presence of anti-Id antibodies against mouse anti-hTg monoclonal antibodies (McAb) in indirect ELISA and in indirect solid-phase RIA. Microtitration plates were coated with six McAb, five of them directed against different epitopes on hTg molecule, and then incubated with patients' sera. The bound antibody was detected with either peroxidase or 125I-labeled anti-human IgG. The specific positive reaction was observed in four of 40 patients with HT, in two of 26 patients with GD, in seven of 58 patients with RA, and in none of 20 normal subjects. The detected binding was due to the presence of anti-hTg anti-Id antibodies and not to Tg-anti-Tg circulating immune complexes, as the positive sera did not contain hTg when resolved on SDS-PAGE, nor did they bind to all anti-hTg McAb tested. The binding was dose dependent, and titers of anti-Id antibodies varied from 1:243 to 1:2187. The binding could be inhibited up to 50% by hTg, but not by the thyroid microsomal antigen, indicating that some of those anti-Id might represent the internal image of the antigen. Serum from the patient 3403, showing the strongest reactivity against McAb A-3, was chosen for IgG purification and F(ab')2 fragment isolation. The 3403 F(ab')2 fragment, but not the Fc fragment, was found to react specifically with four mouse anti-hTg McAb but not with the control mouse IgG. Thus, the obtained results permit the conclusion that anti-hTg anti-Id antibodies could occur naturally during the course of thyroid autoimmune disorders.\r"

Of the nine anti-DNA and anti-Sm monoclonals tested, six showed significant binding to affinity-purified rabbit IgG (RIgG) and human IgG (HIgG). To confirm that cross-reactivities were due to a single antibody, immunoabsorption of a representative polyspecific monoclonal termed C11 (anti-DNA, anti-Sm) on either Sepharose-DNA or Sepharose-RIgG resulted in marked loss of activity to the three antigens DNA, Sm and RIgG compared with immunoabsorption on Sepharose-bovine serum albumin. The monomolecular nature of the cross-reacting antibody was also suggested by inhibition analysis of C11; DNA inhibited C11 binding to RIgG 64%, whereas Sm inhibited binding to RIgG 33%. Aggregated RIgG and HIgG, however, did not inhibit binding of C11 to DNA, Sm, or solid-phase RIgG, probably reflecting the low affinity of this antibody for fluid phase Ig. Together, these findings suggest that antinuclear autoantibodies of the IgG, as well as the IgM, class have polyspecific IgG binding activity and suggest that IgG antinuclear antibodies may emerge from rheumatoid factor responses.\r"

  ".U": "87058996\r", 
  ".W": "We have isolated a syngeneic monoclonal antibody (HepSS-1) reactive to a murine methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma, Meth-A. HepSS-1 also bound to a wide variety of established and fresh normal cells derived from not only mice but also other species such as human, monkey, rat, hamster, and chicken. Immunoprecipitation of surface iodinated Meth-A cell extract with HepSS-1, as well as Sepharose 4B gel chromatography of Meth-A cell extract and detection of antigens recognized by HepSS-1 by a sandwich-type radioimmunoassay revealed that the HepSS-1 antigens were composed of several molecular species, with one as large as approximately 10(6) daltons. The following evidence indicates that HepSS-1 specifically recognizes an epitope present in heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HS-GAG). First, treatment of Meth-A cells with heparitinase or heparinase, but not with chondroitinase ABC or hyaluronidase, resulted in the loss of HepSS-1 binding. Second, HS-GAG but not seven other types of GAG (hyaluronic acid, heparin, chondroitin, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate) inhibited HepSS-1 binding to Meth-A cells. Third, HepSS-1 bound with HS-GAG but not with the seven other types of GAG. From the binding analysis of HepSS-1 to various modified HS-GAG and whale omega-heparin, it is additionally suggested that HepSS-1 recognizes an epitope closely related to O-sulfated and N-acetylated glucosamine. We found that NIH 3T3 cells expressed more HepSS-1 epitopes at a low cell density than at confluency and in G2 + M than in G1, whereas NIH 3T3 cells transformed with Kirsten-ras oncogene or SV-40 expressed high levels of HepSS-1 epitopes and ceased to show the density-dependent change in the amount of HepSS-1 epitopes. These observations were also reproduced by using NIH 3T3 cells transformed with a temperature sensitive Kirsten murine sarcoma virus maintained at permissive and non-permissive temperatures. Thus HepSS-1 is a first monoclonal antibody to HS-GAG and seems to be useful to elucidate changes in cell surface HS-GAG in normal cell growth and cell transformation.\r"

Because small cell lung carcinoma cells synthesize immunoreactive bombesin, we investigated the possibility that alveolar macrophages also contain bombesin, a plausible hypothesis considering the many reports of neuropeptide production by immune cells and cells of bone marrow origin. Adherent human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as human and guinea pig alveolar macrophages were found to contain bombesin.

Following the inheritance of DNA restriction fragment-length polymorphisms revealed by the probes in recombinant inbred mouse strains allowed the factor H-associated fragments to be mapped to Sas-1 on chromosome 1, and the C5-associated fragments to be mapped to Hc. Analysis of three-point crosses, in turn, placed the latter locus 19 cM distal to Sd on chromosome 2. We have designated the two loci Cfh and C5, respectively. This genetic analysis raises the possibility that C5 and factor H are both encoded by complex loci composed of distinct structural and regulatory genes.\r"

CR1 on neutrophils bearing monovalent anti-CR1 was not attached to the cytoskeleton. In contrast, cross-linked CR1 on erythrocytes and cross-linked MHC Class I on neutrophils were not cytoskeleton associated. A possible role for filamentous actin (F-actin) in the binding of cross-linked CR1 to neutrophil cytoskeleton was suggested by three observations. When neutrophils were differentially extracted with either Low Salt-detergent buffer or High Salt-detergent buffer, stained with FITC-phalloidin, and examined by fluorescent flow cytometry, the residual cytoskeletons generated with the former buffer were shown to contain polymerized F-actin, whereas cytoskeletons generated with the latter buffer were found to be depleted of F-actin. In parallel experiments, High Salt-detergent buffer was also found to release cross-linked CR1 from neutrophils. Second, depolymerization of F-actin by DNAse I released half of the cytoskeletal-associated cross-linked CR1. Third, immunoadsorbed neutrophil CR1, but not MHC Class I or erythrocyte CR1, specifically bound soluble 125I-actin. In addition, Fc receptor and CR3, other phagocytic membrane proteins of neutrophils, specifically bound 125I-actin. These data demonstrate that CR1 cross-linked on neutrophils becomes associated with detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton and that this interaction is mediated either directly or indirectly by actin.\r"

  ".W": "The crossing over in five murine I-region recombinants (Is/Ik) was studied by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis after Southern blot hybridization by using I-region-specific probes. These recombinants included three recently developed strains, B10.ASR1, B10.ASR11, and B10.ASR12; and two strains B10.S(9R) and B10.HTT derived earlier. Although these recombinants were reciprocal in haplotype orientation to the three recombinants we reported recently, these too crossed over within the same 7 kb stretch of DNA in the E beta gene. This 7 kb stretch of DNA included the 3' half of the first intron, the beta 1 exon, the second intron, and the beta 2 exon. A comparison of the cDNA sequences of the two parental E beta alleles revealed that although the beta 2 exons were identical, there were several nucleotide differences between the two beta 1 exons. This allowed us to determine the parental origin of the beta 1 exon in the recombinants at the level of transcription by using S1 nuclease mapping. Thus we were able to show that in each case the 3' portion of the first intron and the beta 1 exon were upstream from the site of crossover. All eight recombinants involving the k and s haplotypes now can be mapped within a 4.5 kb stretch of DNA, which includes only the beta 1-beta 2 intron and the beta 2 exon of the E beta gene. These findings imply that the I-E molecules expressed in these recombinants will probably have conserved sequences and therefore will exhibit identical I-E-restricted immune responses, despite the fact that crossing over could have occurred at different sites within the beta 1-beta 2 intron.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to elucidate the cellular mechanism of IgE nonresponse to the Cryptomeria japonica (Japanese cedar) pollen antigen (CPAg), which was shown in our previous study to be HLA-linked (1). We established an assay system for the measurement of small amounts of anti-CPAg IgE antibody, both in an antigen-specific and isotype-specific manner, and a culture system to induce antigen-driven IgE antibody synthesis in vitro. By using these methods, we clarified that the function of the HLA-DR molecule in the CPAg-driven IgE response is similar to that of I-A or I-E molecule in mice, namely the product of immune response genes (Ir-genes), because anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody blocked the response, and the interaction between monocyte and monocyte-depleted peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to respond to CPAg was restricted by HLA-DR. Furthermore, PBL from nonresponders revealed a specific IgE response to CPAg when the Leu-2+3- T cell fraction was depleted, thereby suggesting that even nonresponders have Leu-2-3+ T cell and B cell clones specific for CPAg, and they apparently show no response due to the presence of CPAg-specific Leu-2+3- suppressor T cells. This suppressor T cell fraction abolished the IgE response of the autologous B + monocyte + Leu-2-3+ T cell in a CPAg-specific manner. The current cellular analysis together with our previous genetic analysis strongly suggest that the HLA-linked IgE nonresponse to CPAg is mediated by CPAg-specific suppressor T cells. The HLA-linked gene controlling the nonresponsiveness to CPAg is thus designated as the immune suppression gene for CPAg (Is-CPAg). Mapping of Is-CPAg within HLA-DQ subregion is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) against tumors may be important in preventing in vivo solid tumor dissemination. Multiple animal models demonstrate increased rates of tumor dissemination after surgical stress; previously, we have observed that surgical stress impairs murine NKCC. Because of the importance of surgery in the control of solid tumors, it appeared valuable to examine the mechanism underlying surgical stress impairment of NKCC. The results of this study demonstrate that postsurgical suppression of NKCC begins as early as 2 hr after murine hind limb amputation, reaches nadir at 4 days, and does not recover to control level until postoperative day 12. Anesthetic treatment alone does not cause comparable NKCC suppression. The suppression of NKCC accompanied changes in both splenic size and morphology. The immune suppression was observed in multiple compartments including peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen. Mixing experiments demonstrated that surgical stress per se generated a suppressor cell population affecting NKCC. The observed suppression apparently required cell-to-cell contact, because supernatants from 4 and 18 hr cultures of suppressor cells did not cause suppression. The observed suppression was prevented by perioperative treatment with the pyrimidinone analog 2-amino-5-bromo-6-phenyl-4-pyrimidinol. These preclinical observations point to the future prospect of NK-specific perioperative immunotherapy that may help prevent possible tumor dissemination from occurring at the time of surgery.\r"

The surfactants were block copolymers of hydrophilic polyoxyethylene (POE) and hydrophobic polyoxypropylene (POP) that differed in m.w., percentage of POE, and mode of linkage of POP to POE. The liposomes were haptenated with tripeptide-enlarged dinitrophenyl coupled to phosphatidylethanolamine, which was incorporated into the liposomal membrane. Additional injection of mice with surfactant stimulated serum hemagglutination titers and splenic plaque-forming cell (PFC) numbers to varying extents. Block polymers with POP chains flanking a POE center, as well as polymers with POE chains flanking a POP center, displayed high adjuvant activity. These block polymers stimulated the antibody response in a dose-dependent manner. They stimulated the antibody response with both high and low antigen doses. Furthermore, the addition of one of these adjuvants (25R1) reduced the amount of carrier lipid required in the liposome in order to obtain an optimal antibody response. The surfactants, which displayed high adjuvant activity, did not interfere with liposome stability as measured with a liposome lysis assay. Moreover, in vitro preincubation of liposomes with a block polymer did not affect their immunogenicity. Optimal adjuvant activity was observed when both adjuvant and liposomes were administered by the same route. Simultaneous injection of both components, however, is not a prerequisite. Conclusively, it can be stated that nonionic block polymer surfactants are potent adjuvants for stimulation of the antibody response against haptenated liposomes.\r"

We have found that human neutrophils resist complement lysis by the physical removal of membrane attack complexes by both endocytic and exocytic process. The latter mechanism predominates, vesiculation being detectable within 60 sec of initiating the complement cascade. Sixty-five percent of the formed complexes are removed on plasma membrane vesicles, although only 2% of the cell surface is lost. Ultrastructural examination revealed that these vesicles were covered with ring-like \"classical\" complement lesions. Analysis of these vesicles by gel electrophoresis indicated that C9 was present exclusively in the form of a sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant, high m.w. complex. In contrast, the 35% of C9 that remained associated with the cells was found to be inaccessible to a C9-specific monoclonal antibody, and was partly degraded, suggesting internalization of the membrane attack complex and proteolysis of some C9 molecules. The molar ratio of C9 to C8 was 12 to 1 on shed vesicles and on recovered cells.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils have been shown to express a receptor for C3dg that is distinct from CR2 and is termed complement receptor type 4 (CR4). In the present study, other peripheral blood cell types were examined by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry for the presence of C3dg binding activity. Specific uptake of C3dg occurred with neutrophils, platelets, and B lymphocytes, but not with eosinophils or T lymphocytes. Monocytes, contained within a mixed cell population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and platelets, also bound C3dg, whereas purified monocytes did not. Binding of 125I-labeled glutaraldehyde-cross-linked C3dg to platelets was saturable, with an average of 1940 C3dg molecules bound per platelet at saturation (n = 8), ranging in number from 660 to 3930 molecules bound. Activation of platelets with thrombin did not consistently cause an increase in the expression of CR4 sites. 125I-C3dg binding to platelets was competitively inhibited equally well by unlabeled C3dg and iC3b, and approximately fourfold less well by C3b. The addition of platelets to elutriated monocytes generated C3dg binding activity on these cells by the formation of platelet-monocyte complexes. Thus, the CR4 on platelets accounted for the C3dg binding activity initially observed with partially purified monocytes. The adherent property of platelets may enable them to confer on certain other cell types the ability to localize C3dg-coated immune complexes or particles.\r"

LXA and three of its isomers were prepared by total organic synthesis and assayed for activity with human NK cells. Dose-response studies showed that biologically derived LXA and synthetic LXA were equally effective in inhibiting NK cell cytotoxicity. 6S-LXA, with its 6S-OH group in an (S) configuration, proved to be approximately half as potent as LXA. In contrast, 6S-11-trans-LXA and 11-trans-LXA displayed virtually no inhibitory activities. The methyl esters of both LXA and 6S-LXA proved to be more potent than their corresponding free acids. Thus, LXA inhibition of NK cells displays clear-cut stereochemistry. In the absence of putative inhibitors, NK cells bind to their targets to form conjugates. This event is followed by polarization of the NK Golgi apparatus, which moves towards the plasma membrane that is in contact with the target cell. However, in the presence of either the methyl ester or free acid of LXA, the Golgi apparati of NK cells bound to their targets were randomly oriented. In contrast, neither 6S-11-trans-LXA nor the potent NK inhibitor prostaglandin E2 affected the polarization. Furthermore, although prostaglandin E2 resulted in a decrease in NK-target cell binding efficiency, LXA and its isomers failed to affect conjugate formation. Together these results indicate that LXA-induced inhibition of NK cytotoxicity does not act on NK cell binding but may block cytotoxicity by disrupting \"signals\" involved in the specific orientation of the Golgi. Thus, this latter event may appear to be important in cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Sequential development of Leishmania braziliensis promastigotes from a noninfective to an infective stage was demonstrated. The generation of infective forms was related to their growth cycle and restricted to stationary stage organisms. Using immunofluorescence techniques, we have noticed that the binding of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against L. braziliensis (VD5/25) increased progressively as the promastigotes developed in culture and was maximal with the infective forms. This antigenic differentiation was not detected with an anti-L. braziliensis polyclonal rabbit antiserum, suggesting that only a few epitopes, including that recognized by VD5/25, have their expression effectively increased on the surface of infective promastigotes. Immunoprecipitation of lysates of surface-iodinated L. braziliensis promastigotes with this mAb revealed two proteins of apparent 65,000 and 50,000 Mr, the 50,000 Mr protein probably representing the unreduced form of the major surface glycoprotein described in several species of Leishmania (GP65). The increasing expression of this epitope was not found with L. chagasi promastigotes, but seems to occur with the parasites from the L. mexicana complex. Intracellular survival of L. braziliensis was completely inhibited when the infective promastigotes were treated with VD5/25. It appears, therefore, that the increasing expression of GP65 on the promastigote surface represents an essential mechanism of leishmania survival in the macrophage.\r"

The skin of normal guinea pigs failed to develop any cutaneous changes after inoculation with either dead spores or mycelia. In contrast, guinea pigs that had recovered from a T. mentagrophytes infection reacted to topically applied spores by producing pustules but failed to develop pustules either grossly or microscopically when inoculated with mycelia. Because differences in the activation of C' and the subsequent generation of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemoattractant, C5a, might account for our in vivo findings, we measured the amount of C5a activated in vitro when serum was incubated with equivalent amounts of spores or mycelia. Spores consistently activated more C' to C5a than mycelia, although each could activate serum C'. The results support previous studies that show a direct correlation between the clinical manifestations of a dermatophytic infection and the development of immunity against the dermatophyte. Furthermore, the data suggest that a dermatophyte's predominant morphology during an infection may play a critical role in producing pustules by activating C' and chemoattracting PMNs into the fungus-laden stratum corneum.\r"

In the present study, I examined whether anhidrosis, a cardinal feature of CST, is present in the putative mouse sex-linked model, Tabby.

  ".W": "Early cellular events in the malignant transformation of melanocytes to melanoma are virtually unknown. In vitro investigation of this phenomenon has been hampered by the fastidious nature of the human epidermal melanocyte, which has proven difficult to cultivate. The present study compares responsiveness of cultured human epidermal melanocytes and established melanoma cell lines to serum, cholera toxin, and melanocyte growth factor (MGF), three established melanocyte mitogens. Four of four established human melanoma lines were substantially stimulated by fetal bovine serum, as were newborn foreskin-derived epidermal melanocytes. In contrast, none of the four melanoma lines responded to hypothalamic preparations containing MGF that consistently produced an approximately 30-fold increase in newborn melanocyte cell yield over a 2-week period. Cholera toxin, required for successful establishment of primary melanocyte cultures, had small and variable effects on the melanoma lines, with slight stimulation in one case, moderate inhibition in another, and essentially no effect in two others. These data suggest that transformation of epidermal melanocytes to melanoma often involves at least one phenotypic change resulting in escape from MGF regulation and another associated with insensitivity to cyclic AMP modulation; while at least some of the pathways conferring serum dependence are unaltered. Improved culture systems for the human epidermal melanocyte should facilitate further studies into the mechanism of its malignant conversion and may provide useful insights for the prevention and treatment of human melanoma.\r"

  ".W": "Cell cultures of human keratinocytes contain membrane-associated thioredoxin reductase that is extremely active in reducing radicals on the outer plasma membrane. This enzyme activity was confirmed by its purification from cultures of stratified human keratinocytes by affinity column chromatography. The enzyme was assayed both in vivo and in vitro using a spin-labeled quaternary ammonium compound as the substrate, under saturating conditions in free radical substrate. Specific activities were determined by monitoring the sequential decrease in the amplitude of the electron spin resonance signal per unit of cell protein. The following properties were found: Cultures of adult stratified cells have approximately twice the thioredoxin reductase activity of neonatal cells. The enzyme is inhibited by thioprotein inhibitors (i.e., parachloromecuribenzoate and dinitrochlorobenzene). The activity is regulated by calcium concentrations of the cell culture medium. Stratified keratinocytes are half as active in medium containing 2 mM Ca++ compared with 0.1 mM Ca++ concentration. Product inhibition of the enzyme occurs with oxidized coenzyme NADP+ (i.e., 87% inhibition of enzyme activity over 30 min). The enzyme is heat stable at temperatures of 70 degrees C for 10 min. It is inactivated at 75 degrees C. A comparative study of thioredoxin reductase activity on stratified differentiated and undifferentiated rapidly growing cells was performed. Also, enzyme activity was quantitated for cultured keratinocytes isolated from vitiliginous and normal skin of the same donor. The results of this study, and the connection between this enzyme activity and UV-generated free radicals are reconciled in terms of the mechanism of action and metabolic activity of thioredoxin reductase.\r"

  ".W": "Sebaceous wax esters and epidermal acylceramides were isolated from skin surface lipid obtained from children and from young adults. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were prepared from the esterified fatty acids of these lipid classes and analyzed to ascertain the proportions of methyl linoleate (18:2 delta 9,12), methyl sebaleate (18:2 delta 5,8), and methyl sapienate (16:1 delta 6). On the same subjects, 2 measures of sebum secretion rate were obtained, namely the sustainable wax ester secretion rate (WESR) on the forehead and the ratio of wax esters/(cholesterol + cholesterol esters) [WE/(CH + CE)] in the surface lipid. The proportions of methyl linoleate in FAME from the wax esters decreased, and the proportions of methyl sebaleate increased, with increased rates of sebum secretion. For both methyl linoleate and methyl sebaleate, a better correlation was obtained when the ratio of WE/(CH + CE) was used as a measure of sebum secretion rather than the WESR. The proportions of methyl linoleate in the FAME from the acylceramides were also inversely related to ratios of WE/(CH + CE). In acylceramides, linoleate was replaced by sapienate, a major fatty acid of human sebum. It appears, therefore, that sebum fatty acid composition may change with changes in sebaceous gland activity, and that sebum fatty acids can enter the epidermis and be incorporated into epidermal lipids.\r"

Here we report that colloidal gold solutions conjugated with SpA, bovine serum albumin (BSA), or gelatin bind selectively to structures in glutaraldehyde-fixed, plastic-embedded epidermis of rabbit, mouse, and human. Two types of keratohyaline granules are present in epidermis, a phosphorus-rich (PR) and a sulphur-rich (SR) type. The PR keratohyaline granules were strongly labeled with gold particles, whereas SR keratohyaline granules or other structures in the living cells of epidermis were unlabeled. The PR keratohyaline granules are assumed to be precursors of the matrix protein of cornified cells, and intense gold labeling occurred over the lower layer of cornified cells (i.e., stratum lucidum). More superficial cornified cells were weakly labeled or unlabeled. The gold labeling pattern was identical whether SpA, BSA, or gelatin was used to stabilize the colloidal gold solution. The mechanism of binding of protein-conjugated gold to PR keratohyaline granules and matrix protein of cornified cells is not clear. It is speculated that the charged gold particles are not completely coated by the stabilizing protein, allowing for an electrostatic interaction with charged proteins in sections of cells.\r"

It was thus possible to determine lipid concentrations in 12 consecutive epidermal layers, extending 96 microns into the skin. The phospholipids that were characterized all decreased in concentration toward the surface, whereas the neutral lipids and ceramides all increased. Glucosylceramide and acylglucosylceramide reached a peak concentration in the stratum granulosum and then decreased in the surface layers. Cholesterol sulfate reached a maximum concentration in the deeper stratum corneum and then abruptly decreased in the surface layer. These changes in patterns of lipid concentration are consistent with current theories regarding the formation of a water barrier in the stratum corneum that is composed mainly of neutral lipids, and with a possible function of cholesterol sulfate in cellular adhesion in the stratum corneum.\r"

  ".W": "In earlier studies, it was shown that the human plasma-spreading glycoprotein, epibolin (the 65 kD species of serum-spreading factor or vitronectin), requires a second plasma component, termed coepibolin, in order to support maximal dissociated epidermal cell spreading in tissue culture. Whereas epibolin alone in defined medium supports some cell spreading, the purified plasma coepibolin preparations do not effect spreading in the absence of epibolin. Although not yet entirely purified, coepibolin associates with some plasma fractions but not with others; it is certainly not a property of all proteins, e.g., while bovine serum albumin (BSA) has coepibolin activity, ovalbumin does not. The data presented here show that the phorbol ester, 12-tetra-decanoyl-1-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) can act as a potent coepibolin and support maximal spreading over a concentration range of 10-100 ng/ml. In the absence of epibolin TPA does not stimulate the spreading of epidermal cells when given alone or in the presence of BSA or ovalbumin. Coepibolin activity appears to associate with tumor-promoting activity in that the phorbol derivative, phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, shows coepibolin activity, while its inactive non-tumor-promoting isomer, phorbol-4 alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, does not. These data suggest that the proteinaceous plasma-derived cofactor acts in a fashion similar to TPA and that this as yet unexplained mechanism of TPA action is important to the full expression of epibolin and to the early phase of epidermal cell spreading.\r"

In order to further elucidate the significance of lipids in the water-holding properties, lipids, which were extracted as sebaceous-rich lipids (SL) for the first 10-min acetone/ether treatment and as stratum corneum lipids (SCL) for the additional 30-min treatment, were topically applied daily on lipid-depleted forearm skin which had been pretreated with acetone/ether for 40 min. Two daily applications of the SCL which were solubilized in squalane containing 1% alpha-monomethyl heptadecyl glyceryl ether (GE) caused a significant increase of conductance, accompanied by a marked improvement in the level of scaling as compared with nontreatment or GE/squalane base, whereas the SL in the GE/squalane base did not exhibit any significant recovery in either conductance value or scaling. To clarify which components of the SCL are primarily responsible for the observed recovery of the water-holding properties, chromatographically separated fractions of the SCL were also topically applied in the same manner for 2 successive days. Out of the following separated fractions: cholesterol, cholesterol ester, free fatty acid, glycolipids, and ceramide, 2 daily topical applications of ceramide fraction induced a significant and the highest increase in the conductance value as compared with GE/squalane base. Furthermore, glycolipids and cholesterol fractions also exhibited a significant recovery when compared with no application at all. In contrast, free fatty acid and cholesterol ester fractions did not indicate any significant increase in the conductance value. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that structural lipids present in the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum, especially ceramide, play a critical role in the water-holding properties of the stratum corneum.\r"

Follicles are freed from the surrounding connective tissue by shearing, which is effected by repeated cutting with a loosely fitting pair of scissors, and collected individually under liquid using gentle aspiration. Ultrastructural analysis indicates that the follicles are sheared away from the surrounding dermis in the region of the connective tissue capsule which encircles the hair. The follicles appear viable by light and electron microscopy and, within 2 h of isolation, retain the capacity to incorporate [3H]thymidine into DNA and [35S]methionine into proteins as judged by autoradiography. A histologic comparison indicates that the structural integrity of follicles isolated by this new method is significantly superior to those plucked from the animal at the same time. The method affords the isolation of large numbers of hair follicles, without resort to enzyme treatments, suitable for biologic studies in the absence of other skin appendages and dermis.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to investigate the effect of middle-wave ultraviolet (UVB) radiation on mast cell functions using mouse ear skin as an in vivo model. Groups of UVB-irradiated BALB/c mice were given an intradermal injection of the mast cell degranulator compound 48/80 into ears at various time intervals (30 min-7 days) after a single exposure to a bank of fluorescent sunlamp tubes (10-100 mJ/cm2). Both the compound-evoked ear swelling response (ESR) and mast cell degranulation were significantly suppressed by preexposure to UVB (25-100 mJ/cm2) after 0 (30 min) to 3 days postirradiation, with a subsequent recovery by day 7. No such effects were observed in mice irradiated with 10 mJ/cm2. The ESR induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine was not significantly affected by UVB radiation during the experimental period. While within this dose range UV radiation itself caused neither loss of mast cell counts nor a measurable degree of degranulation in ear skin, exposure to larger amounts of UV energy (200-500 mJ/cm2) produced tremendous ear swelling with histologic features of mast cell degranulation in an early phase of inflammation. The results suggest that UVB radiation exerts a dual effect on mast cells and that administration of smaller amounts of UVB may alter the mast cell/vasoactive amine system, suppressing ear swelling in response to the degranulator. Vascular reactivities to vasoactive amines were not affected by UVB irradiation.\r"

  ".W": "The origin of Merkel cells is still a matter of debate, specifically the question of whether they are derived from epithelial cells of the epidermis or from immigrated neural crest cells. As an argument for the latter hypothesis the occurrence of dermal, nerve-associated Merkel cells in human fetal skin has often been mentioned. Therefore, we analyzed the distribution of Merkel cells in epidermis and dermis of plantar skin of human embryos and fetuses, ranging in gestational age between 7 and 17 weeks. Merkel cells were identified by immunocytochemistry on frozen sections using antibodies against simple epithelium-type cytokeratins and by electron microscopy. In the 17-week-old fetus, 17% of the total cutaneous (epidermal and dermal) Merkel cells were located in the upper dermal compartment, whereas in the 14-week-old fetus only 3.9% of the Merkel cells were dermal, including some cells that seemed to be in the process of traversing the dermal-epidermal junction. Thirteen-week-old fetuses showed even fewer dermal Merkel cells. Twelve-week-old fetuses exhibited 660 epidermal Merkel cells per 100 mm total section length, but none in the upper or deep dermis. In 7- to 9-week embryos, no Merkel cells were recognized. However, at this stage, but not in later stages, the basal cells of the plantar epidermis expressed certain simple epithelium-type cytokeratin polypeptides. These results speak against an invasion of Merkel cells or putative neural crest-derived precursor cells into the epidermis via a dermal passage. They suggest that in plantar skin Merkel cells arise, between weeks 8-12, from precursor stages of epithelial cells of the early fetal epidermis which still express simple epithelium-type cytokeratins. The results further suggest that in subsequent stages of skin development some epidermal Merkel cells detach from the epithelium and migrate into the upper dermis where some of them may associate with small nerves.\r"

About 41% of the patients were found to have values above the normal range. A good correlation was observed between elevated levels of aminopropeptides and the degree of involvement of the skin and internal organs in the patients. Most patients (89%) with an active progression of the disease but not those in a stationary phase showed increased serum levels of aminopropeptides. Treatment with corticosteroids apparently normalized the levels of aminopropeptides. Only minor changes were observed with an antibody-based radioimmunoassay which measures primarily the intact form of the aminopropeptide.\r"
