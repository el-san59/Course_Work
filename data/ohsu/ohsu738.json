  ".W": "The intellectual and functional status of a regional cohort of children who weighed 501 to 1000 gm when born between 1980 and 1982 was evaluated at a mean age of 5 1/2 years by standard psychometric tests. Of 90 long-term survivors (survival rate 49%), 78 children (87%) had the full test battery, 5 children (6%) had other tests (4 were blind), and one child was untestable. Most of the mean scores were within 1 SD of the test norms; the lowest scores were in the McCarthy Motor scale and in the Beery Test of Visual-Motor Integration. Children without neurologic impairments and those with an IQ greater than or equal to 68 (n = 60) had higher overall scores but still performed poorly on the Motor subscale and the Beery test. Children who weighed less than 800 gm at birth (n = 28) were similar to those who weighed greater than 800 gm (n = 50), except in the Memory and Motor subscales, in which they performed significantly less well. At a functional level, determined by the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales, two thirds of the children were performing in the adequate range and the remainder in the moderately low to low range. Of the 43 children with no neurosensory impairments and an IQ greater than or equal to 84, 49% were identified (by the Florida Kindergarten Screening Battery) to be at mild to high risk for future learning disabilities. The data from this unselected population provide an unbiased estimate of the prevalence of intellectual and functional problems in children who weighed less than or equal to 1000 gm at birth.\r"

SUBJECTS: Eleven \"well\" infants with a birth weight and gestational age (mean +/- SD) of 1078 +/- 128 gm and 29 +/- 1.9 weeks, respectively, were studied for a 3-week period. Weight and postnatal age (mean +/- SD) at the beginning of the study were 1132 +/- 56 gm and 16 +/- 6 days, respectively. All infants were fed a preterm infant formula and tolerated a full enteral intake (120 kcal/kg/day) for the duration of the study. INTERVENTIONS: Plasma 25-OHD and 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations were measured at the beginning of the study and at the beginning of each 48-hour balance period. Calcium and phosphorus balance studies (n = 33) were performed weekly. MAIN RESULTS: Plasma 25-OHD (30 +/- 10 ng/ml) and 1,25-(OH)2D (54 +/- 14 pg/ml) concentrations were normal at the beginning of the study. Plasma 25-OHD values did not change, but 1,25-(OH)2D values increased (p less than 0.001) throughout the study. Plasma 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations were not related to calcium or phosphorus absorption and retention, but were a linear function of postconceptional age. CONCLUSIONS: Normal vitamin D status and activity are maintained in the very low birth weight infant fed a high calcium formula (380 to 480 IU of vitamin D daily). Plasma 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations are not related to calcium absorption but are linearly related to maturity.\r"

  ".W": "A chemiluminescence (CL) microassay was used to evaluate polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) function in premature newborn infants longitudinally during a 2-month period and in healthy adult control subjects. At postnatal ages of 12, 26, 40 and 54 days the infants' mean peak CL activity was significantly lower than that of the adults. Infants with one or more low CL responses were more severely ill than those with normal CL activity. The infants with low CL responses had longer hospital stays and a higher frequency of serious infections, as well as more days of level 3 care, antimicrobial therapy, supplemental oxygen, assisted ventilation, and total parenteral nutrition. The PMN CL activity before, during, and after episodes of serious infection did not differ. In addition, a high frequency of depressed CL activity was observed at the time of infection. Our findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that defective PMN oxidative metabolic responses are more common in neonates undergoing stress. Our results further suggest that defective PMN function may persist for the first 2 months of life and during the course of serious infection. Enhancement of PMN host defense may be an important strategy in the management of neonatal sepsis.\r"

Surfactant protein A concentrations were standardized per milligrams of total protein present in the aspirate. Among the 23 survivors with complete data, the surfactant protein A concentration increased significantly with time (p less than 0.0001). Concurrent increases in lung compliance (p less than 0.0001) and radiographic scores (p less than 0.0001) were also observed. This increase in surfactant protein A content may reflect lung recovery from barotrauma and oxygen toxic effects or be a response to the primary pulmonary disease process. The two infants who did not survive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation failed to demonstrate these trends.\r"

The overall prevalence of gynecomastia in the 377 with complete data was 48.5% (51% of white subjects and 46% of black subjects). In the majority of subjects, gynecomastia developed during mid-puberty. Gynecomastia was bilateral in 55% of subjects, on the left side in 19%, and on the right in 26%. Gynecomastia was documented for only one visit in the majority of subjects. When subjects were matched at the onset of gynecomastia for race, visit number, and pubertal rating, there were no significant differences between those with or without gynecomastia in serum estradiol level, testosterone level, estrogen/testosterone, ratio, or dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate level. However, free testosterone level, weight, and Quetelet index were all significantly lower, and the testosterone-estrogen binding globulin level was significantly greater, in those with gynecomastia. We conclude that approximately half of adolescent boys have transient gynecomastia, usually lasting less than 1 year; those with gynecomastia enter mid-puberty at an earlier age, have a lower Quetelet index, and have lower serum free testosterone levels.\r"

  ".W": "Because adolescents avoid bringing sensitive issues, such as substance abuse, suicide, and sexual activity, to pediatricians, and may fail to realize that they need health education or services, a computer program was designed to facilitate reporting of high-risk psychosocial and health behaviors and to provide specific health advice and referral for timely professional intervention. Computer printouts done anonymously by a random sample of 265 adolescents after a physical examination were compared with those of a matched group of 294 who were predirected to share the printout with the clinician at their examinations. The former elicited more positive responses to sensitive health problems, but both computer groups responded significantly more often about most high-risk issues than a matched written questionnaire group of 251. Almost all adolescents said that they reported true information to the computer and read all the information it printed. Experience with 3327 teenagers demonstrated that 89% preferred the computer over a questionnaire or personal interview, but nearly all were willing to share the printout with the pediatrician, which should facilitate clinical evaluation. The nonjudgmental computer can identify problem areas and deliver automated medical advice and referral. Automated health assessment and education may become a useful adjunct for addressing adolescent health issues.\r"

Adolescents were interviewed regarding their beliefs about the consequences of using each of four methods of contraception, evaluation of those consequences, perception of the wishes of others regarding use of each method, motivation to comply with those wishes, general attitude toward using the method, view of general social expectations regarding their use of the method, and their intention to use the method during the next year. They were reinterviewed 1 year later to determine actual use. The results support the utility of this model for understanding adolescent behavior. Significant associations were found between intentions to use contraceptive methods and their actual use. Intentions were significantly related to adolescents' attitudes toward using the methods and their perception of social expectations regarding use. General attitudes were significantly related to a summary score reflecting the adolescents' beliefs about specific consequences of use weighted by their evaluations of them. General social perceptions were significantly related to a summary score of perceived desires of specific individuals multiplied by the adolescent's desire to comply with those desires. These findings indicate that physicians can be more effective in clinical practice by querying adolescents about their beliefs and intentions and about their perceptions of significant individuals in their lives.\r"

It was improbable that contagious infections of childhood or seasonal infections could be important triggers of RA.

A recent survey of 76 patients with scleroderma revealed that more than 90% had the scleroderma neck sign. Our study was performed using 15 patients with scleroderma and 30 controls including 3 with primary Raynaud's disease to examine the specificity of the scleroderma neck sign, and to look for a correlation between the presence of the scleroderma neck sign and histological changes of scleroderma in the skin overlying platysma. The scleroderma neck sign was present in 12 of the 15 patients with scleroderma but in none of the 30 controls. It was found both in patients with diffuse (5 out of 5) and limited (7 out of 10) scleroderma. In 10 of the 12 cases where the scleroderma neck sign was positive, there were characteristic histological changes of scleroderma on biopsy of the skin overlying platysma, in 1 there were nondiagnostic abnormalities, and in 1 the biopsy was unsatisfactory. The 3 patients with scleroderma in whom the scleroderma neck sign was absent had either nondiagnostic changes (1) or normal biopsies (2). The 3 patients with Raynaud's disease had normal skin biopsies. The scleroderma neck sign appears to be produced by scleroderma changes in the skin of the neck. In limited or early scleroderma where these changes are otherwise clinically inapparent, the scleroderma neck sign may be diagnostically useful.\r"

The ANA- granddaughter (daughter of the proband) was noted to have severe isolated pulmonary hypertension within the first 6 months of life, and had the other maternal HLA-A1 Cw8 B14 DR1 DQw1 haplotype, which included a B1, B2 duplication of the C4B allele. All 3 members shared DRw52. The possibility that neonatal pulmonary hypertension represents an isolated autoimmune disease or a hitherto undescribed neonatal syndrome is proposed and the immunogenetic autoantibody implications are discussed.\r"

They received hydroxychloroquine in a mean dosage of 3.6 mg/kg (range 2-5 mg/kg) while maintaining corticosteroid therapy. Significant improvement was noted at 3 months of therapy in rash (p less than 0.0001), proximal (p = 0.0004) and abdominal muscle strength (p = 0.0001) and at 6 months of therapy in reduced prednisone dosage (p less than 0.02). These data suggest hydroxychloroquine may be helpful in some patients with childhood DM, particularly those with prominent cutaneous disease or significant corticosteroid toxicity.\r"

It can occasionally affect the exocrine glands presenting with xerophthalmia and xerostomia similar to Sjogren's syndrome. We present 5 such patients who visited our rheumatology clinic complaining of dry eyes and mouth. Investigation for xerophthalmia and xerostomia showed positive rose bengal tests in all patients, positive Schirmer's I tests in 4 and decreased parotid flow rate in 3. Minor salivary gland biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas compatible with sarcoidosis in 3. In the other 2 patients the diagnosis was obtained with transbronchial lung biopsy that revealed noncaseating granulomas. Transbronchial lung biopsy also showed granulomas in 2 patients with positive minor salivary gland biopsy. Our results suggest that sarcoidosis can present with initial symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth. When this happens, transbronchial and minor salivary gland biopsy are very valuable in differentiating sarcoidosis from Sjogren's syndrome.\r"

Cartilage with low endogenous levels are stimulated by interleukin 1 (IL-1) to levels comparable to the high endogenous group. Total blood mononuclear cell products obtained from different individuals either behave in a manner similar to that seen with IL-1, which results in sustained high levels of enzyme secretion, or show an initial stimulation followed by a subsequent dropoff in enzyme secretion even though incubation is continued in the presence of mononuclear cell products. The factor(s) causing this dropoff can be distinguished from IL-1. Production and regulation of such factors may reflect a mechanism whereby the action of IL-1 can be controlled during the inflammatory response.\r"

Forty-two patients with ischemic necrosis of bone had hemodynamic studies performed on their contralateral, asymptomatic joint. A followup evaluation of symptoms and radiographs was obtained to establish the prevalence of clinical ischemic necrosis in the index joints. Thirty-six of 48 joints had increased bone marrow pressure and of these, 15 (42%) developed histologically or radiographically confirmed ischemic necrosis of bone. In none of the 12 bones with normal bone marrow pressure did ischemic necrosis of bone occur (p = 0.005). Venography was also significantly predictive for ischemic necrosis of bone, both alone and in conjunction with bone marrow pressure. Our study reaffirms the risk of developing bilateral ischemic necrosis of bone (31% at a mean followup of 47 months) once the diagnosis has been made on one side. Bone pressure measurements are of predictive value in establishing those joints which require close clinical followup so that detection of disease may be in the precollapse stage of ischemic necrosis of bone.\r"

One hundred and sixteen patients took 188 courses of nonsalicylate NSAID during the 3-year study period. The NSAID prescribed included naproxen, ibuprofen, sulindac, indomethacin, piroxicam, and tolmetin. Naproxen was used significantly longer than any other NSAID (p less than 0.001).\r"

Gastroduodenal lesions were found in 55% (11/20) of the subjects taking naproxen, and 10% (2/20) of those taking salsalate (p = 0.002). Twenty-five percent (5/20) of the subjects taking naproxen and none of the subjects taking salsalate were noted to have severe gastric injury (p = 0.003). There was no difference between the 2 groups in subjective gastrointestinal system adverse experiences. Overall, 95% (19/20) of subjects taking salsalate reported at least 1 adverse experience compared with 60% (12/20) of those taking naproxen (p = 0.02). This was due primarily to the higher number of subjects taking salsalate reporting reversible tinnitus or hearing loss. There was no significant treatment difference in adverse experiences reported for any other organ system. The results of our study support previous observations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis that salsalate produces less gastroduodenal mucosal toxicity than the widely used antiinflammatory agent, naproxen.\r"

Other clinical manifestations commonly seen were pulmonary symptoms, fever, lymphadenopathy, and the development of myopathy. Laboratory features included mild elevations of aldolase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, with essentially normal creatine kinase levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and C-reactive protein levels. Biopsy findings included features of scleroderma, small-vessel vasculitis, fasciitis, and myopathy. Discontinuation of tryptophan administration and implementation of corticosteroid therapy were of some benefit in relieving the intense myalgias and cutaneous findings that developed. Although temporally related to tryptophan ingestion, it is unclear whether this substance, a metabolite, or a contaminant were causal. We speculate that the pathogenesis of this syndrome may relate to abnormalities in tryptophan metabolism.\r"

We applied this simple law to the reported annual incidence of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in the United States from 1982 through 1987. The 6 years of incidence data closely fit a normal distribution that crests in late 1988 and then declines to a low point by the mid-1990s. The projected size of the epidemic falls in the range of 200 000 cases. A continuing incidence of endemic cases can be expected to emerge, but we believe it will occur at a low level.\r"

Treatment of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is difficult since the drug has a prolonged half-life, cardiac decompensation due to underlying heart disease occurs often, and discontinuation of amiodarone therapy may not be possible. We report a patient with severe thyrotoxicosis who received amiodarone for 34 months. Prolonged treatment with methimazole, potassium perchlorate, iopanoic acid, and dexamethasone was unsuccessful in controlling the hyperthyroid state. A near-total thyroidectomy resulted in rapid amelioration of thyrotoxicosis. Since surgery results in rapid control of thyrotoxicosis and permits continued therapy with amiodarone, we suggest that near-total thyroidectomy warrants consideration as definitive treatment for resistant amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.\r"

  ".W": "Selection of appropriate laboratory determinations will enable the clinician to diagnose thyroid dysfunction readily in the majority of patients. At the present time, estimation of free thyroxine and a \"sensitive\" thyrotropin assay are recommended as the principal laboratory tests for thyroid disease. A decrease in serum free thyroxine estimate and a raised level of serum thyrotropin confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism caused by thyroid gland failure. An increase in free thyroxine estimate combined with a serum sensitive thyrotropin level suppressed to less than 0.1 mU/L establishes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis. In sick patients, a normal or raised serum free thyroxine estimate together with a normal level of serum thyrotropin suggests that the patient has neither hypothyroidism nor thyrotoxicosis. Patients with severe illnesses, generally in the intensive care unit, and those treated with certain drugs, as well as individuals with unusual thyroid disorders, may present with confusing laboratory findings. An understanding of the regulation of the thyroid hormone system and/or judicious consultation with an endocrinologist should enable the clinician to diagnose thyroid disease, if present, in such patients.\r"

The health maintenance organization's computerized pharmacy database identified recent stoppers--patients who did not fill their prescriptions regularly enough to be at least 80% compliant. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, subjects who had recently stopped using beta-blockers had a transient fourfold increase in the relative risk of coronary heart disease (relative risk, 4.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 18.5). The association was specific to beta-blockers but not diuretics.

Viruses cultured from the lesions were resistant to acyclovir in vitro after the patients had received prolonged therapy with oral and intravenous acyclovir in traditional divided doses. Investigation into the mechanism of the acyclovir resistance revealed changes in the thymidine-kinase activity of both isolates. This viral enzyme phosphorylates acyclovir and is necessary for drug activation. The first patient's isolate was deficient of all thymidine-kinase activity, while the second patient's isolate had a thymidine kinase with altered substrate specificity for acyclovir. The continuous infusion was safe, well tolerated, and done in an outpatient setting with weekly clinic visits and monitoring of creatinine and acyclovir levels.\r"

However, the precise mechanisms of erythrocyte Al uptake and toxicity are poorly understood. Al accumulation, hemoglobin (Hb) synthesis and cell growth were evaluated in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-induced Friend erythroleukemia cells (FEC), a model system for erythroid differentiation. FEC were grown in media containing either Al citrate, transferrin-aluminum (Tf-Al), Tf or no additions. Al accumulation occurring only in cells grown in Tf-Al containing media was detected at 24 hours and increased linearly up to 96 hours after induction. By 96 hours, 200 +/- 36 micrograms Al/liter lysed cells were detected in Tf-Al grown cells versus 5 +/- 1 micrograms Al/liter lysed cells in cells grown in Al citrate (P less than 0.001). Tf-Al inhibited Hb synthesis at 72 hours after induction. At 96 hours 50 +/- 15% cells were benzidine positive when grown in Tf-Al compared to 76 +/- 15% in Al citrate (P less than 0.001). FEC grown in increasing concentrations of Tf-Al (100 to 500 micrograms/ml) showed inhibition of Hb synthesis at lower concentrations of Tf-Al at 100 micrograms/ml than for cell growth at 300 micrograms/ml. Higher concentrations of Tf-Al (greater than 300 micrograms/ml) did not further inhibit Hb synthesis or cell growth. Iron (Fe) and Tf uptake were increased in Al loaded FEC compared to control cells. The increased Tf uptake was probably the result of increased Tf receptor expression on FES since Tf cell cycling time was unchanged. These data indicate that Al utilizes the Tf uptake pathway for entry into erythrocyte precursors. Al is toxic at sites distal to Fe uptake, possibly at the heme and/or globin synthetic pathways, resulting in decreased Hb synthesis and cell growth.\r"

The X-linked Hyp mouse is characterized by reduced phosphate transport and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) synthesis relative to normal, whereas the phosphate-deprived mouse exhibits elevated phosphate transport and vitamin D hormone synthesis. Protein kinase C activity was higher in renal cytosol of Hyp mice, when compared to normal littermates (358 +/- 11 vs. 244 +/- 31 pmol 32P/mg prot/min, P less than 0.02), whereas genotype differences in brush border membrane and mitochondrial kinase were not apparent. Phosphate deprivation of normal mice elicited a 50% reduction in brush border membrane protein kinase C (from 819 +/- 56 to 460 +/- 48 pmol 32P/mg prot/min, P less than 0.03), an increase in mitochondrial kinase (from 57 +/- 7 to 87 +/- 10 pmol 32P/mg prot/min, P less than 0.03), and no change in cytosolic kinase activity. Phosphate deprivation of Hyp mice led to an increase in mitochondrial protein kinase C (from 72 +/- 7 to 98 +/- 9 pmol 32P/mg prot/min, P less than 0.03) and no change in either brush border membrane or cytosolic kinase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Phase partitioning analyses of a brush border membrane preparation obtained with a divalent cation precipitation procedure (Am J Physiol 246:F853-F858, 1984) confirmed that Na+/H+ antiport activity was localized primarily to the brush border membrane of the rabbit proximal tubular epithelial cell. This analysis also indicated that antiport activity was associated with membrane populations that appeared to be derived from cytoplasmic structures. However, since the starting point of the analysis was a partially-purified brush border sample rather than a total membrane sample, it was not possible to discern the magnitude of the potential cytoplasmic pool of antiport activity. We have now used a three dimensional analytical fractionation procedure, based on differential centrifugation, equilibrium density gradient centrifugation, and partitioning in an aqueous polymer 2-phase system, to survey the subcellular distribution of Na/H antiport activity in rat kidney cortex. Roughly 53% of the recovered antiport activity could be assigned to a population of brush border membrane vesicles characterized by a 15-fold enrichment of maltase. An additional 26% of the recovered activity could be assigned to a group of three membrane populations whose biochemical characteristics appeared equally consistent with origins in distinct microdomains of the brush border membrane and with origins in microdomains of the Golgi complex involved in the assembly or recycling of brush border membrane constituents. Therefore, depending on the identities of membranes which contained the secondary pool of Na+/H+ antiport activity, no more than one-third of the total recoverable Na+/H+ antiport activity could be assigned to cytoplasmic membranes of the proximal tubular epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "The activation of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) by particulate Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THG) represents an interaction hitherto unrecognized. The potential pathophysiological effect of this phenomenon within the interstitium of the kidney is highlighted by the activation of the respiratory burst, as well as by comprehensive PMN degranulation. Products of the interaction are expressed in terms of phagocytosis, luminol-dependent chemiluminescence, granule marker enzyme release and arachidonic acid metabolism. Significant quantities of the primary, secondary and tertiary granule markers, myeloperoxidase, vitamin B12 binding protein and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, respectively, were secreted in a dose and time-dependent manner. Phagocytosis of the glycoprotein was accompanied by the generation of significant quantities of leukotriene B4. Furthermore, the ability of such a particulate ligand to activate the alternative pathway of complement clearly represents a capacity to augment the inflammatory response. Should the interaction of THG with PMN take place within the interstitium of the kidney, augmented by the deposition of complement proteins on the surface of insoluble aggregates, the resulting inflammatory response may lead to marked tissue damage and eventually result in interstitial fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "The content of platelet activating factor (PAF) in glomeruli isolated from rats with nephrotoxic serum glomerulonephritis (NSGN) was quantified at various stages of the disease and the role of complement, platelets and neutrophils in mediating changes in glomerular PAF levels was evaluated. PAF content was assessed following extraction, isolation and quantification of this alkyl ether lipid using a bioassay based on [3H]-serotonin release from labelled rabbit platelets. Following induction of NSGN using proteinuric doses of rabbit immune serum raised against rat glomerular basement membrane, enhanced glomerular PAF levels were observed at 3 hours, 24 hours and on day 15 following induction of the disease. In complement depleted rats and at three hours following induction of NSGN, glomerular PAF levels were significantly lower than in complement replete controls studied in parallel. At the same time point of the disease, platelet depleted rats with NSGN demonstrated significantly lower glomerular PAF levels than parallel controls, whereas in neutrophil depleted rats glomerular PAF levels were no different than controls. These observations indicate that in infiltrative and complement dependent forms of glomerular immune injury, glomerular PAF levels are increased via a complement mediated mechanism. Infiltrating platelets, but not neutrophils, partially account for the enhanced glomerular PAF levels. The observations are of potential importance in the pathophysiology of glomerulonephritis.\r"

  ".W": "We previously described the development of glomerulosclerosis in mice transgenic for large T-antigen, a gene whose in vitro expression markedly increases proliferation of cultured cells. In the current study we sought to determine the effect of unilateral nephrectomy on these sclerosis-prone animals which have a genetically defined potential for increased renal growth. In comparison with sham nephrectomy animals, nephrectomized transgenic female mice had significantly larger kidneys, larger glomeruli (5886 mu2 npx vs. 3796 mu2 sham), more cells per glomerulus and more severe glomerulosclerosis. Nephrectomized transgenic male animals had variable increases in kidney size, no significant increase in glomerular size (4750 mu2 npx vs. 4502 mu2 sham) or cellularity, and no worsening of glomerulosclerosis. In non-transgenic female animals nephrectomy induced an increase in kidney size but not in glomerular size (2640 mu2 npx vs. 2625 mu2 sham) and failed to induce glomerular lesions. A close correlation (r = 0.91) was found between glomerular size and severity of glomerulosclerosis in these animals. This finding supports the hypothesis that a pathophysiologic link exists between glomerular enlargement and glomerulosclerosis. We also found that increases in total kidney size and glomerular size did not consistently parallel each other, that is, renal hypertrophy may occur without an increase in glomerular size. This finding suggests that total kidney growth and glomerular growth may be independently regulated or may have different thresholds for activation following unilateral nephrectomy.\r"

Twenty-four, 48, or 72 hours later, animals were infused with 14C-inulin, PAH and 3H-T and clearances obtained. Prior to sacrifice, India ink was injected for glomerular counting. By 24 hours, glomerular filtration rate per nephron was significantly increased in UNI. However, in R, glomerular filtration rate per nephron was significantly lower than S until 72 hours. Total micrograms DNA per nephron was unchanged in UNI but significantly increased in R compared to S at all times. 3H-T incorporation into DNA was twice as great in UNI as in S was over five-fold greater at 24 hours in R than in S; this marked increase persisted in R at 48 and 72 hours. Autoradiographs confirmed that DNA was synthesized predominantly by renal tubular cells and not infiltrating cells. These results indicate that hyperplasia in compensatory renal growth is related to the quantity of tissue removed and that, in the remnant kidney, DNA synthesis precedes the compensatory increase in glomerular filtration rate per nephron.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of chronic beta adrenergic blockade on potassium homeostasis during moderate intensity exercise (40% of VO2 max) was examined in seven end-stage renal patients who were being maintained on chronic dialysis treatment. Subjects participated in three study protocols: 1) exercise alone, 2) exercise plus propranolol (a nonselective beta-1, beta-2 antagonist), and 3) exercise plus metoprolol (a specific beta-1 antagonist). The basal potassium concentration was similar in all three studies and averaged 4.95 +/- 0.12 mEq/liter. During Study 1 (exercise alone), plasma potassium rose by 0.26 +/- 0.09 mEq/liter. During exercise with propranolol, plasma K concentration rose significantly higher (delta plasma K = 0.44 +/- 0.26 mEq/liter; P less than 0.05 vs. exercise alone). In contrast, the rise in plasma K during exercise with metoprolol (delta plasma K = 0.20 +/- 0.08 mEq/liter) was similar to that observed with exercise alone. Differences in potassium homeostasis between metoprolol and propranolol could not be explained by differences in hemodynamic parameters, levels of potassium regulatory hormones, or acid base status. Thus, the higher rise in potassium concentration during exercise with propranolol could only be explained by adrenergic blockade at the beta-2 receptor site. These results support the concept that adrenergic control of extrarenal potassium homeostasis in dialysis patients is mediated at the beta-2 receptor. Since a deterioration in potassium homeostasis during exercise is observed with beta-2, but not beta-1 blockade, selective beta-1 adrenergic blocking agents may be safer in dialysis patients.\r"

This technique produced a satisfactory yield of well preserved glomeruli and enabled the identification of glomerular pathology with the accuracy comparable to that of renal core biopsy. The FNA plasma clot method may prove useful in the study of glomerular pathology under conditions where the use of percutaneous biopsy is conventionally limited or avoided.\r"

These properties, plus the fact that the ethanol signal can be further isolated from other resonances by spectral editing, open several possibilities for further investigation.\r"

Each subject received one of three widely different doses of alcohol. Analysis of the results of the cognitive test battery demonstrated that a high dose of alcohol detrimentally affects a number of functions associated with the prefrontal and temporal lobes, including planning, verbal fluency, memory and complex motor control. Expectancy does not appear to play a significant role in determining this effect. The implications of this pattern of impairment are analyzed and discussed.\r"

Using age-adjusted rates, we found no evidence of a major shift toward convergence in cirrhosis mortality over this time period for the total population. When age-specific rates were examined, we found evidence for increasing divergence in liver cirrhosis mortality rates for those under the age of 55, whereas the general trend among the older age groups was toward convergence. Straightforward interpretation of the results is hampered by the lack of research in related areas, but the findings do suggest that greater public and professional education may serve a preventive purpose for older U.S. females.\r"

Only 7% of alcoholic smokers were successful in their attempts to quit smoking compared to 49% of the nonalcoholic smokers. More research comparing the smoking cessation efforts of alcoholics and nonalcoholics is needed to confirm these findings. Alcoholism is estimated to be 10 times more common among smokers than among nonsmokers. Possible explanations for this include a susceptibility on the part of some individuals to addictive drugs in general, and/or for some individuals tobacco smoking and alcoholism are both sequelae of a propensity to behave irresponsibly.\r"

Over 11% of a sample of 254 men identified as bad drivers during an index year received an initial DWI arrest over a subsequent 3-year follow-up period. This was over five times greater than the rate of initial DWI arrest among a representative sample of men from the general driving population over the same time period. The same high rate of subsequent DWI arrest among drivers having four or more driving offenses within the index year was replicated in a 1% probability sample of over 39,000 drivers from the general driving population. Those individuals from the original group of 254 bad drivers who received an initial DWI had significantly higher levels of drinking at the time of their original identification as bad drivers than did those who did not receive a DWI. The results were discussed in terms of early identification and preventive interventions within the population of bad drivers.\r"

Analyses revealed that scores of sons of alcohol abusers differed significantly from controls on all 10 Clinical scales and 7 of 13 Wiggins Content scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.

These studies investigated the possibility of negative stereotypes toward COAs emanating from peers and from the mental health community. In Study 1, 570 high school students were asked to rate six separate roles (typical teenagers--male and female; teenagers with an alcoholic parent--male and female; and mentally ill teenagers--male and female) using 11 bipolar adjective pairs. Subjects rated \"COAs\" as significantly different overall from both \"typical teenagers\" and \"mentally ill teenagers.\" When individual nonsignificant differences occurred, COAs were more often grouped with mentally ill teenagers. These correlational findings were extended in an experimental study (Study 2) using mental health workers (N = 80). Subjects watched videotapes of an adolescent who was described as having either a positive or negative family history of alcoholism and as having either a high degree of social success (school leader) or social problems (behavior problems). The adolescent targets labeled COA were judged as more pathological than those labeled non-COA in terms of current and predicted psychological health and psychopathology. These judgments held regardless of the teenagers' labeled current behavior. Both studies demonstrated robust negative stereotypes about COAs both from the COAs' peers and from those responsible for treating COAs. The potentially harmful consequences of labeling COAs--especially those who are currently well-adjusted--are discussed.\r"

This study tested the predictive strength of these factors in a prospective sample of untreated, nonhospitalized young male (n = 98, mean = 25.2 years) and female (n = 121, mean = 25.5 years) offspring of alcoholic (n = 131) and nonalcoholic (n = 88) parents. NIMH-Diagnostic Interview Schedule items were used to diagnose blindly DSM-III alcohol or drug abuse or dependence. No alcohol- or drug-related behavioral items were used in ASP diagnosis. Parental alcoholism was rated using proband information and Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria. ASP, then gender and finally FHA but not age were significant predictors of DSM-III alcoholism. The log linear analysis improvement chi square was significant at p less than .05 for each variable and the overall goodness of fit of the model was substantial (chi 2 = 13.3, p = .78). Prediction of lifetime alcohol abuse/dependence rates for young adults in a prospective sample was highly significant. These three factors with separate genetic vulnerability increased risk over a lifetime. Male gender increased the risk for alcoholism 1.5 times, FHA 1.5 times and ASP diagnosis 3 times in an independent and additive manner.\r"

  ".W": "From June 1983 to April 1988, 100 consecutive infants with symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot (without pulmonary atresia) were operated on. Ages ranged from 0.5 to 12 months (mean 7.3 +/- 3.7). Twenty patients were 0.5 to 3 months, 21 were 3 to 6 months, and 59 were 6 to 12 months of age. Mean weight was 6.5 kg +/- 1.7. Seventy patients received a transannular patch. The hospital mortality rate was 3% and there were no late deaths. Cumulative follow-up was 180 patient-years. Causes of death included hypoplastic pulmonary arteries (4 and 5 months old) and right ventricular failure (4 months old). The most important factors influencing right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction were neither weight (p = 0.90) nor age (p = 0.05) but rather were the ratio between weight and pulmonary arterial outflow tract diameter (p = 0.0005) and the ratio between body surface area and pulmonary arterial outflow tract diameter (p less than 0.0001). The last 48 patients were operated on with no deaths. During this period, operative management differed essentially in myocardial protection with blood cardioplegia. The predicted 30-day survivorship after repair was 90% to 99% (95% confidence limits). No ventricular arrhythmias have been detected after repair (mean follow-up 22.2 months). Mean right ventricular/left ventricular end-diastolic dimension ratio was (0.53 +/- 0.10 with M-mode echocardiography. These early results encourage us to proceed with primary repair of infants with symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot thanks to improved surgical management and enhanced myocardial protection.\r"

A simple technique that consumes less operative time, accompanying less bleeding, and that enables eradication of the disease in one stage was devised by the senior author. The technique requires only three major steps: (1) decortication limited to the parietal sides of the peel's sac, (2) cleansing the empyemic cavity, and (3) drainage. To date, six patients have been treated by this method; complete cure was achieved in all. Neither death nor recurrence of the disease has been noted during the follow-up period averaging 24.5 months. The mean operative time was 3.06 hours, mean bleeding volume was 1262 ml, and the mean hospital stay period was 1.14 months. The methods and results of the technique are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The objectives of this study were to elucidate the long-term influence on vein bypass grafts of platelet inhibition and its late discontinuation. Cephalic vein grafts were interposed bilaterally in the femoral arteries of stump-tailed macaque monkeys fed a diet that sustains plasma cholesterol levels of approximately 225 mg/dl. Fifteen animals were divided into three groups of five animals each. Group I received no medications and served as a control group. Group II received for the full duration of the study a combination of aspirin, 80 mg/day, and dipyridamole, 50 mg/day. Group III received the same regimen of platelet inhibition as in group II during the first 9 months, but were not treated during the subsequent 9-month interval. Grafts were excised for analysis from groups I and II at both 9 and 18 months and from group III at 18 months. Cholesterol content in group I grafts was 470 +/- 89 micrograms/100 mg at 9 months and 388 +/- 127 micrograms/100 mg at 18 months. In group II grafts, cholesterol content was 208 +/- 72 micrograms/100 mg at 9 months (p less than 0.001 compared with group I) and 266 +/- 84 micrograms/100 mg at 18 months. In group III grafts, cholesterol content was 249 +/- 71 micrograms/100 mg at 18 months. Differences in cholesterol content among the three groups of grafts at 18 months were not found to be statistically significant. Stepwise regression analysis at 18 months showed that cholesterol content was best predicted by medial fibrosis (r2 = 0.66) followed by abundance of foam cells (increase in r2 = 0.26) in group I, by fibrin in group II (r2 = 0.63), and by prevalence of macrophages in group III (r2 = 0.74). In all groups, platelets, fibrin, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were less abundant than they had been at 3 months. Cross-sectional area occupied by the intima was not influenced by platelet inhibition.\r"

  ".W": "A pig model of autologous saphenous vein to common carotid artery bypass grafting was developed. An end-to-end anastomotic technique led to lower middle graft and distal turbulence. Saphenous veins were surgically prepared with or without distention at 600 mm Hg, implanted into the arterial circulation, and removed 2 hours later. Medial integrity was then assessed by adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate concentration ratio, and endothelial integrity, leukocyte and platelet adhesion by scanning electron microscopy. In grafts made with undistended vein adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate concentration ratio was not significantly lower (3.0 +/- 0.1, n = 32) than in freshly isolated vein (3.3 +/- 0.1, n = 26), endothelial cover was 98% +/- 1%, n = 6, and there was little platelet or leukocyte adhesion. In distended grafts adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate concentration ratio was reduced to 2.2 +/- 0.2 (n = 7, p less than 0.005), endothelial cover was reduced to 38% +/- 14% (n = 6, p less than 0.001), and there was extensive platelet and leukocyte adhesion to exposed subendothelium. In separate experiments graft patency measured at 1 to 5 weeks was significantly greater (96%, n = 25) when undistended vein was used than when distended vein was used (64%, n = 25, p less than 0.005). The data show that distention leads to medial and endothelial damage and that this is associated with increased platelet and leukocyte adhesion and with reduced early patency.\r"

  ".U": "90173352\r", 
  ".W": "Atrioventricular node reentry tachycardia is the most common cause of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Available nonpharmacologic therapies include (1) catheter ablation or cryosurgical ablation of the His bundle and insertion of a permanent pacemaker and (2) surgical dissection around the atrioventricular node or discrete cryosurgery of the perinodal tissues, in an attempt to divide or ablate only one of the dual atrioventricular node conduction pathways responsible for the tachycardia while leaving the other intact. This report describes 23 consecutive patients who underwent the discrete cryosurgical procedure between August 13, 1982, and March 16, 1989. The first patient in this series, a 38-year-old woman, is the first patient in whom refractory atrioventricular node reentry tachycardia was cured surgically by a procedure designed to treat this arrhythmia. The ages of the 13 female and 10 male patients ranged from 12 to 56 years with an average age of 29 years. Fourteen of the 23 patients (61%) had the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Other associated arrhythmias included atrial flutter/fibrillation (n = 2), right atrial reentrant tachycardia (n = 1), junctional tachycardia (n = 1), and a Mahaim fiber (n = 1). Associated anatomic abnormalities included Ebstein's anomaly in two patients and a large right atrial aneurysm in one patient. The perinodal cryosurgical procedure was performed through a right atriotomy in the normothermic beating heart. Multiple 3 mm diameter cryolesions were placed around the borders of the triangle of Koch on the lower right atrial septum to alter the input pathways of the atrioventricular node. There were no operative deaths in this series of patients. Postoperatively, all 23 patients had normal atrioventricular conduction, and no heart block has occurred in any patients during the follow-up period. All patients have remained free of atrioventricular node reentry tachycardia (and of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) and none has required postoperative antiarrhythmic drugs for either of these arrhythmias. We consider this simple, safe, easily performed, and uniformly successful operation to be the procedure of choice for the treatment of medically refractory atrioventricular node reentry tachycardia.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-six patients undergoing a modified Fontan procedure from 1977 to 1985 had lung tissue available from the perioperative period (n = 51) or recent palliative procedure (n = 5) (37 biopsy, 12 autopsy, 7 biopsy and autopsy). Twenty-six patients had tricuspid atresia, and 30 had other causes of functional univentricular heart. Pulmonary arterial structure was classified by both the Heath-Edwards and morphometric scales. Biopsy and autopsy grades were identical except for a minor difference in Heath-Edwards scale in one case. Elevated preoperative mean pulmonary artery pressure (greater than 15 mm Hg) was associated with medial hypertrophy (p = 0.04), although six patients with normal pulmonary artery pressure had medial hypertrophy and six patients with mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 15 mm Hg did not have medial hypertrophy. Medial hypertrophy was a possible risk factor in patients with univentricular heart: Patients with medial hypertrophy had a ninefold greater risk of death (p = 0.08). Controlling for confounding variables did not alter this result (0.06 less than or equal to p less than or equal to 0.10). Medial hypertrophy was not a risk factor for death in patients with tricuspid atresia: Four had this feature and each survived. Four patients with tricuspid atresia died and none had medial hypertrophy. A mean transpulmonary pressure gradient was measured on the first postoperative day in 45 patients. In patients with medial hypertrophy there was a trend toward a higher gradient (p = 0.13). All patients with medial hypertrophy who had this measurement (n = 9) had a transpulmonary pressure gradient of 7 mm Hg or greater, whereas this was true in only 18 of 36 without medial hypertrophy (p = 0.007). On the basis of an evaluation of medial hypertrophy, we conclude that biopsy does not aid in selection of patients with tricuspid atresia for a Fontan procedure; its role in patients with univentricular heart is uncertain.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to determine if augmentation of myocardial adenosine levels during global ischemia improves functional recovery after reperfusion. Isolated adult rabbit hearts were subjected to 120 minutes of mildly hypothermic ischemia (34 degrees C) with modified St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution used to provide myocardial protection. Myocardial adenosine levels were augmented during ischemia by providing exogenous adenosine in the cardioplegic solution or by inhibiting adenosine degradation with 2-deoxycoformycin, a noncompetitive inhibitor of adenosine deaminase. Four groups of hearts were studied: (1) control (n = 23)--cardioplegia alone; (2) adenosine group (n = 10)--adenosine 200 mumol/L added to the cardioplegic solution; (3) 2-deoxycoformycin group (n = 8)--2-deoxycoformycin 1 mumol/L added to the cardioplegic solution; and (4) a combined adenosine/deoxycoformycin group (n = 10). Recovery of developed pressure 45 minutes after reperfusion in the control group averaged only 38% +/- 4% of baseline values. Significantly better recovery was evident in the adenosine (66% +/- 7%), deoxycoformycin (59% +/- 2%), and adenosine/deoxycoformycin (75% +/- 2%) groups. The slope of the relationship between end-diastolic pressure and volume was used as an index of diastolic stiffness. The slope averaged 85 +/- 2 mm Hg/ml in the control group 45 minutes after reperfusion, significantly higher than that in the adenosine (31 +/- 6), deoxycoformycin (75 +/- 5), and adenosine/deoxycoformycin (58 +/- 5) groups; this suggests better diastolic function in the adenosine-augmented groups. During ischemia, adenosine levels were significantly elevated in the adenosine-augmented groups, whereas adenosine triphosphate decreased equally in all four groups, which indicates that augmenting myocardial adenosine had no effect on depletion of adenosine triphosphate during ischemia. After reperfusion, adenosine triphosphate levels were depressed in the control group but increased in the other groups above baseline values, which suggests that improvement in functional recovery was due to accelerated repletion of adenine nucleotide stores in the adenosine-augmented groups.\r"

During 4 1/2 hours of global ischemia, three groups of six dogs each received one of three histidine-buffered cardioplegic solutions (500 ml initially and 250 ml every 30 minutes) at 27 degrees C. Group 1 cardioplegic solution was calcium free, group 2 solution contained a trace amount of calcium chloride (70 mumols /L), and group 3 cardioplegic solution was calcium free but contained diltiazem (150 micrograms/kg body weight). Left ventricular function measured as percent control of developed pressure revealed significantly greater (p less than 0.05) recovery in groups 2 and 3. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining showed 35% +/- 9% (mean +/- standard error) of heart mass necrosis in group 1 versus 0% and 0.5% +/- 0.4% in groups 2 and 3, respectively (p less than 0.001). Electron microscopy revealed ultrastructural changes characteristic of calcium paradox injury in group 1 myocardium. Calcium paradox injury was produced in an in vivo model of global myocardial ischemia and multidose cardioplegia despite moderate hypothermia and non-coronary collateral flow. The addition of either trace levels of calcium or diltiazem to the cardioplegic solution was effective in preventing this injury.\r"

A composite superior vena cava was reconstructed on the right side from the recipient translocated superior vena cava, donor superior vena cava and innominate vein, and recipient in situ pericardium. The inferior vena cava was rerouted from the left side across the midline to the right through a composite conduit consisting of the recipient night atrium and in situ pericardium over the diaphragm.

The ages of recipients ranged from 1 month to 64 years and of donors from 1 month to 48 years. The actuarial survival rates for cyclosporine-treated patients were 80.7% at 1 year and 59.7% at 5 years and were significantly greater than those for previous patients not treated with cyclosporine (p less than 0.005). Their actuarial prevalence of rejection was 60.0% at 1 month and 86.9% at 1 year; 206 patients are living. The actuarial prevalence of lymphoma development was 4.6% at 5 years but has been significantly lower with the current immunosuppression protocol of lower doses of cyclosporine, and OKT3 in place of rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (p less than 0.005). Infection remains the most common cause of death. Recipients less than 50 years of age had a significantly higher actuarial survival than older recipients (p less than 0.01). Male and female recipients had similar overall prevalence of survival and rejection, but men died of graft atherosclerosis significantly more frequently (p less than 0.005). Rehabilitation has been successful in 85% of patients surviving 1 year after transplantation. Of those surviving 1 year, 96.5% were in New York Heart Association class I. Thus the results of orthotopic cardiac transplantation have improved since the introduction of cyclosporine and have allowed measured liberalization of the criteria for recipient selection.\r"

Prearrest and postischemic left ventricular functions were compared by means of an isolated working heart apparatus. Hearts (n = 8 per group) arrested and stored for up to 8 hours all resumed the spontaneous rhythm of contraction during reperfusion for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C. There was good recovery of aortic flow rate (105% +/- 3%) against a pressure of 100 cm H2O, of heart rate (102% +/- 2%), and of aortic pressure (86% +/- 5% of prearrest values). Hearts stored for 10 and 20 hours showed poor or no postischemic recovery of cardiac pump function (aortic flow, 16% +/- 11% and 0%, respectively). Enrichment of St. Thomas' Hospital solution with L-glutamate (20 mmol/L) also failed to improve functional recovery of hearts subjected to 10 hours of storage, but hearts treated with St. Thomas' Hospital solution containing L-aspartate (20 mmol/L) or L-aspartate plus L-glutamate (20 mmol/L each) reestablished aortic flow rates of 99% +/- 5% and 93% +/- 4%, respectively. These results indicate that the addition of L-aspartate to St. Thomas' Hospital solution improves the functional recovery and extends the safe preservation of explanted hearts stored at 4 degrees C.\r"

To better define subclinical coagulation in man, we measured plasma fibrinopeptide A concentrations before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were assigned to one of three groups of heparin management: group 1 (n = 10)--initial heparin dose 300 IU/kg, with supplemental heparin if the activated coagulation time fell below 400 seconds; group 2 (n = 6)--initial heparin dose 250 IU/kg, with supplemental heparin if activated coagulation time was less than 400 seconds; and group 3 (n = 5)--initial heparin dose 350 to 400 IU/kg, with supplemental heparin if whole blood heparin concentration was less than or equal to 4.1 IU/ml. Activated coagulation time and heparin concentration were measured every 30 minutes during cardiopulmonary bypass, and fibrinopeptide A was measured at hypothermia, normothermia, and whenever activated coagulation time was less than 400 seconds. Quantitative and qualitative blood clotting competence was assessed after cardiopulmonary bypass, including mediastinal drainage for the first 24 hours. Fibrinopeptide A values were markedly elevated during cardiopulmonary bypass but were well below the levels present before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Fibrinopeptide A correlated inversely with heparin concentration during cardiopulmonary bypass (r = -0.46, p = 0.03), but higher fibrinopeptide A levels during cardiopulmonary bypass did not correlate with post-cardiopulmonary bypass coagulopathy. Group 3 patients received the highest heparin doses (p less than 0.05) and had the greatest postoperative blood loss (p less than 0.05). Protamine dose and heparin concentration during cardiopulmonary bypass correlated best with postoperative mediastinal drainage. Our findings support the following conclusions: (1) compensated subclinical plasma coagulation activity occurs during cardiopulmonary bypass despite activated coagulation time greater than 400 seconds or heparin concentration greater than or equal to 4.1 IU/ml; (2) post-cardiopulmonary bypass mediastinal drainage correlates strongly with increased heparin concentration during cardiopulmonary bypass (p less than 0.05) and protamine dose (p less than 0.05); and (3) during cardiopulmonary bypass at both normothermia and hypothermia, activated coagulation times greater than 350 seconds result in acceptable fibrinopeptide A levels and post-cardiopulmonary bypass blood clotting.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated 158 hearts from patients with tetralogy Fallot so as to probe the precise anatomy of so-called membranous flaps and their relationship to the ventricular septal defect, the tricuspid valve, and the atrioventricular conduction axis. A membranous flap was detected in 61 hearts (38.6%) of the 158, all being found when the ventricular septal defect was perimembranous. Two types of flap were discovered. A remnant of the interventricular membranous septum (or a real flap) was seen in 32 and reduplication of the leaflets of the tricuspid valve (pseudoflap) was present in 32. The pseudoflaps either were connected to the anteroseptal commissure of the tricuspid valve or were attached to the medial papillary muscle complex. The medial papillary muscle was abnormally attached more frequently in those hearts with flaps (31%, 52%) than in the ones lacking a flap (5%) (p less than 0.01). An anomalous arrangement of the leaflet of the tricuspid valve was significantly more prevalent in those hearts with a pseudoflap (41%) than in those with a real flap (14%) and in those without a flap (9%). There was a tendency for real flaps to be smaller (p less than 0.05) and thinner than pseudoflaps. A few flaps were considered too tiny to warrant placement of sutures within their structure during surgical repair. During our investigation, we noted also the morphologic arrangement of the rest of the hearts.\r"

  ".W": "Intraoperative evaluation of the effectiveness of myocardial revascularization has been limited by an inability to assess regional myocardial perfusion. Microbubbles of sonicated diatrizoate sodium and diatrizoate meglumine (Renografin) have been an effective echocardiographic contrast agent and have been employed clinically during cardiac catheterization. This recent development in contrast-enhanced two-dimensional echocardiography permits real-time imaging of transmural myocardial blood flow but has not been evaluated in the operating room. This study represents the initial surgical application of this directed technique and was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraoperative perfusion contrast echocardiography in assessing the results of coronary artery bypass grafting. Twenty men with significant coronary artery disease ranging in age from 49 to 73 years were studied. Direct contrast agent injection into completed saphenous vein bypass grafts caused the myocardium supplied by each graft to be well delineated and provided a tomographic view of contrast distribution. The enhanced region was well correlated with the size and distribution of the native vessel. Rapid contrast washout (less than 20 seconds) indicated satisfactory regional perfusion. Contrast echocardiography prolonged the operation less than 10 minutes and did not result in any perioperative complications.\r"

  ".W": "The Carpentier-Edwards standard porcine bioprosthesis was implanted in 1190 patients (1201 operations, 1303 valves) between January 1975 and June 1986; most implants were before 1982. The mean age of the patients was 57.2 years (range 8 to 85 years). The early mortality was 7.6% (aortic valve replacement 5.1%, mitral valve replacement 8.8%, and multiple valve replacement 15.3%). Late mortality was 3.9% per patient-year (aortic valve replacement 3.6%, mitral valve replacement 4.2%, and multiple valve replacement 3.8%). The total cumulative follow-up period was 6737 years. Thromboembolism was 1.5% per patient-year (fatal 0.4% per patient-year) (minor 0.6%, major 0.9%); antithromboembolic therapy-related hemorrhage was 0.5% (fatal 0.1%); prosthetic valve endocarditis was 0.6% (fatal 0.2%); nonstructural dysfunction was 0.5% (fatal 0.2%); and structural valve deterioration and/or primary tissue failure was 1.5% per patient-year (fatal, 0.2% per patient-year). Thromboembolism and structural valve deterioration were the significant complications, structural valve deterioration occurring primarily between the sixth and 10th year of evaluation. The overall patient survival was 65.0% for aortic valve replacement and 54.8% for mitral valve replacement (p less than 0.05) at 10 years. The patients were classified as 92.9% New York Heart Association functional classes III and IV preoperatively and 92.3% classes I and II postoperatively. Freedom at 10 years from thromboembolism was 84.3% for aortic valve replacement and 76.5% for mitral valve replacement (p = 0.05); structural valve deterioration was 78.6% for aortic valve replacement and 71.6% for mitral valve replacement (p less than 0.05); reoperation was 74.4% for aortic valve replacement and 67.1% for mitral valve replacement (p less than 0.05). Freedom from all valve-related complications at 10 years was 58.9% for aortic valve replacement and 46.8% for mitral valve replacement (p less than 0.05); valve-related mortality was 89.5% for aortic valve replacement and 82.6% for mitral valve replacement (p = not significant); mortality and reoperation was 58.9% for aortic valve replacement and 46.8% for mitral valve replacement (p less than 0.05); mortality and residual morbidity (treatment failure) was 87.2% for aortic valve replacement and 75.1% for mitral valve replacement (p = not significant); mortality, residual morbidity, and reoperation were 66.3% for aortic valve replacement and 54.9% for mitral valve replacement (p less than 0.05). The standard Carpentier-Edwards porcine bioprosthesis has provided satisfactory clinical performance and has afforded patients excellent quality of life.\r"

There were significant rises in exercise time (mean [SD] 13.2 [5.5] to 20.0 [6.2] min), maximum oxygen consumption (19.1 [7.0] to 25.0 [6.7] ml.min-1.kg-1), and anaerobic threshold (11.7 [3.6] to 15.4 [4.8] ml.min-1.kg-1) after 2 months of erythropoietin treatment. The improvements were maintained but not augmented on repeat testing after 4, 8, and 12 months of therapy. Carbon monoxide transfer [corrected] rose from 15.5 (2.9) to 18.6 (3.7) ml.min-1.mm Hg-1. There was a substantial reduction in exercise-induced cardiac ischaemia (eight patients had significant ST segment depression before erythropoietin, only one after 2 months' treatment, and none after 12 months' treatment), despite a significant rise in whole blood viscosity. Left ventricular mass, as estimated by echocardiography, progressively decreased from 354 (169) g to 251 (95) g after 12 months' treatment, and four patients showed a reduction in cardiothoracic ratio on chest X-ray.\r"

Three models, based on Cox' regression analysis, were used. Two models were derived from survival of PBC patients in drug trials and the third from cirrhotic patients who did not receive transplants. Observed and expected survival were compared for a follow-up time of 7 years. After 1 year the difference in favour of LTx was small, but after 5 years survival with LTx exceeded all predicted survival probabilities without LTx. After 3 years every year of follow-up added about 0.3 years to expected survival gain per transplanted patient, resulting in 1.5 to 2.3 life-years gained at 7 years' follow-up, depending on the model used. The benefit was greatest for patients in Child-Pugh classes B and C. The consistency between the three models in their predictions supports the validity of the use of predictive models in the indirect assessment of LTx.\r"

All but 1 case showed only 1 region of tumour. 66% of tumours involved one breast quadrant, 23% extended over more than one quadrant, and 11% were centrally located. Mammographic estimates, based on the extent of microcalcifications, frequently underestimated the histological size of tumours, the extent of the discrepancy being related to the histological type--8/50 predominantly micropapillary/cribriform. In view of the frequently large size, adequate excision of many DCIS will require a wide excision involving up to a whole quadrant.\r"

Animals fed this food factor and a high-sodium diet had significantly smaller endolymphatic sac lateral intercellular spaces than those animals fed only a high-sodium diet (analysis of variance with Scheffe's multiple comparison test, P less than 0.001). Animals fed a high-sodium diet had significantly larger endolymphatic sac lateral intercellular spaces than those animals fed a control diet only (analysis of variance with Scheffe's multiple comparison test, P less than 0.001). Results of this study suggest that dietary sodium affects endolymphatic sac fluid dynamics and that other food factors may regulate sodium metabolism, and therefore endolymphatic sac function.\r"

The duration of endotracheal intubation is considered the most important etiologic factor. Surprisingly, most premature infants do not acquire subglottic stenosis. Infants with similar clinical characteristics and care have varying laryngeal outcomes. We hypothesized an autoimmune mechanism to type-II collagen to explain the varying laryngeal outcomes of these infants. A retrospective study of premature infants of comparable birth weight, gestational age, and duration of endotracheal intubation was conducted. The eight control children, who did not manifest symptoms of airway obstruction, had longer durations of intubation than did the infants who developed subglottic stenosis. Three of five affected infants had serum antibodies to type-II collagen, in contrast to none of the control infants (P = .035). This finding warrants additional study, and might lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic measures for these patients.\r"

A discussion of these treatment modifications is provided. All patients should be treated in close communication with the medical transplant treatment team.\r"

To determine whether preoperative awake upper airway measurements predict the response to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, presurgical lateral cephalometric radiographs were evaluated on 60 consecutive patients with symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea. Patients underwent overnight polysomnograms before uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and 3 months afterwards. Forty-eight (80%) patients had a good response as defined by a postoperative apnea index of less than or equal to 4 apneas/hour or a reduction in apnea index of greater than or equal to 60%. Responders had a significantly narrower inferior airway space (P less than .0005) and a smaller ratio of inferior airway space to tongue length (P less than .001). Improvement in apnea severity following uvulopalatopharyngoplasty was related to the degree of airway narrowing (r = 0.36; P less than .01). This study shows that upper airway measurements help predict response to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Patients with a narrow airway, particularly relative to tongue size, have good responses to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty.\r"

Aging in peripheral nerves has been reported to resemble a \"dying back\" neuropathy in that the most severe and earliest age-related changes occur at the most distal levels of the nerve fibers. The lengths and terminal axonal branching of neuromuscular junctions in 17 human posterior cricoarytenoid muscles aged 4 days to 95 years were determined. Both neuromuscular junction lengths and the numbers of axonal terminal branches in the very young group differed significantly from values in two older groups. In contrast to results reported for some other muscles, there was no significant age-related change in these parameters in the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle during adult life. This difference may be related to the repetitive contraction of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle.\r"

Collagen (2.5-5cc) is injected through a device designed for vocal-fold and laryngeal rehabilitation. Several injection points are necessary to raise a good Passavant's ridge. The muscular activity of the posterior pharyngeal wall models the collagen pad for the first 3 weeks; afterwards, the collagen shape remains unchanged due to its integration in the host tissues. At this time, five patients have been injected with Gax collagen and have improved. The oldest case dates from 28 months ago; the most recent dates from 8 months ago. There were no adverse reactions, and the results remain stable at the present time.\r"

Thirteen percent of the patients had septal perforations, 3.5% epistaxis, and 36% complained of mild dryness of the nose. An improvement in breathing was noted in 24% of the patients. There was no difference in rhinological complaints between patients who underwent the sublabial approach and those operated via a transnasal approach. Twenty percent of the patients operated on with the sublabial approach had additional temporary complaints in the upper lip; therefore, the transnasal-transseptal approach is currently our procedure of choice.\r"

Age-related differences in the brainstem respiratory centers may account for differences in the LCR and play a role in such disorders as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and infant apnea. Study of the LCR at the brainstem level could provide insights into normal maturation of respiratory centers and eventually the pathophysiology of these disorders. The present study evaluated the laryngeal brainstem response (LBR) evoked by electrical stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve in kittens using a far-field technique similar to auditory brainstem response testing. Recordings were obtained via posterior pharyngeal and posterior cervical recording sites and compared to results previously obtained in our laboratory for adult cats. The LBR in kittens demonstrated differences in threshold, latencies, and morphology which suggests that postnatal maturation of laryngeal function at the brainstem level does occur.\r"

Recent correlations of the levels of acute-phase and immune-reactive proteins with tumor extent, immune reactivity, and circulating immune complex (CIC) levels in patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma prompted an investigation of the relationship of CICs to those protein factors characteristically altered in the serum of patients with NPC. In 70 untreated NPC patients and 21 normal participants, levels of CIC, Igs, immune-reactive proteins, and EBV antibody titers were measured and correlations with tumor extent and clinical stage determined. In patients with advanced tumors (stages III and IV), levels of CIC, immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and acute-phase proteins (haptoglobin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, alpha 1-antitrypsin) were significantly increased compared to stage I, stage II patients, or normals. In patients with elevated CIC levels, levels of IgA and IgM were significantly increased compared to normals or patients with normal CIC levels. Uniquely, serum IgA levels correlated directly with CIC levels among patients but not controls. EBV antibody titers were increased in the NPC patients and were not significantly related to tumor extent or CIC levels. The immunosuppressive properties of CICs might account, in part, for the immune suppression previously reported in patients with NPC. Thus, the increased levels of CICs demonstrated in these patients provide a rationale for evaluating the effects of removing CICs, since such therapeutic manipulations have been associated with tumor regressions in patients with other tumor types.\r"

Currently, the technique is most frequently used in scalp surgery for correction of male pattern baldness. Other uses of tissue expansion are in cranial facial surgery and expansion of distant, regional, or microsurgical flaps. Perhaps its greatest value from a reconstructive perspective, however, is in providing new skin for reconstruction of various facial defects through the use of primary wound closure or a multitude of local flaps.\r"

  ".W": "The heating potential of a closed loop interstitial hyperthermia system employing 1,064 nm laser light in conjunction with a long frosted contact probe was investigated in hind limb muscle of anesthetized dogs. The laser system was an Nd:YAG surgical laser modified with a single channel thermometry unit, a computer, a printer, and a computer-controlled laser exposure shutter. The long frosted laser probe was implanted into the muscle, and 3.12-5.00 Watts of laser power was delivered interstitially. Temperature distribution was measured in three dimensions around the frosted probe. The temperature distributions generated by this technique were satisfactory for producing desired hyperthermia temperatures in an approximately 3.5 cm3 cylindrical tissue volume. A multiple laser delivery system is needed to induce interstitial hyperthermia in large tumors. A significant potential for the long frosted contact probe may be its use in combining interstitial hyperthermia and interstitial photodynamic therapy. Using this technique, both modalities may be delivered while employing the same treatment setup.\r"

A fiber with its tip inside the balloon transmitted energy from an Nd:YAG laser for coagulation of tumors in one bile duct cancer, in six portal vein growths from primary liver cancers, and in a superficially growing stomach cancer. The balloon increased the precision of irradiation by making lesions easier to identify through displacement of bile or blood and by keeping the fiber tip at a fixed position relative to the lesion. The technique, basic experimental studies, and clinical experiences are reported.\r"

  ".W": "Light in the visible and near-infrared region is diffusely scattered in tissues by macromolecules. It was therefore hypothesized that tissue coagulation caused by high-power continuous wave laser irradiation might significantly alter tissue optical properties, resulting in a redistribution of laser energy during the laser ablation process. Infrared transmittance studies confirmed the hypothesis by demonstrating an irreversible decrease in light transmittance (45%) during heating of a 0.75 mm thick slice of tissue. Absorption and scattering coefficients were then determined from transmittance and reflectance measurements on thin slices of raw and coagulated myocardium irradiated with a Nd:YAG laser (1.06 microns). The scattering coefficient was found to increase fourfold (0.427 mm-1----1.74 mm-1) during tissue coagulation, while the absorption coefficient remained relatively unchanged (0.044 mm-1----0.051 mm-1). Calculations indicate that the coagulation-induced changes in tissue optical properties substantially increase surface back-scattering and reduce tissue penetration.\r"

Microscopic examination of nuclear spreads revealed an increased number of cells in mitosis after a single irradiation with 142 J/cm2. These results support previous observations suggesting that laser light of low thermal energy interferes with cell cycling and may inhibit cell growth when irradiation is performed at doses of 11.9 J/cm2 or more.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopic detection of small tumors is key to the early diagnosis and treatment of malignancy. This paper describes a simple, endoscopic detection system which enables tumor localization and a permanent record based on the laser-induced fluorescence of dihematoporphyrin ether (LIFD). Spectral analysis of dihematoporphyrin ether (DHE, Photofrin II) was performed with a Perkin Elmer LS-5 scanning fluorimeter. DHE at concentrations of 50 micrograms/ml and 5 micrograms/ml in 95% ethanol were tested, demonstrating fluorescence quenching at 50 micrograms/ml DHE at 406 nm excitation. This phenomenon was not observed at 442 nm excitation. Based on this data and the availability of the helium cadmium laser, a series of endoscopic detection systems was developed and tested utilizing a LiConix 4240NB helium cadmium laser (TEMoo, 442 nm, 40 mW). A fiber with a microdiverging (MDL) lens was used. Irradiance achieved at the tip of the fiber was 31.58 mW/cm2 for MDL. A Corning 34832 (550 nm) sharp cutoff barrier filter was coupled to an Olympus OES BF2T10 bronchoscope. Successful detection of LIFD was obtained. Direct observation of LIFD is possible when wearing Laserguard argon safety goggles (OD 15 at 488 nm, OD 11 at 514 nm). Photographic recording of LIFD was performed with the following cameras and parameters: Olympus OM-2S camera (OM2) with EES135 film (ISO 1600) with a 4-second exposure (method 1) and the Olympus OES SCP-10 instant camera with Polaroid 779 (ISO 640) film and a 120-second exposure (method 2). The photographic methods demonstrate the red fluorescence of DHE on filter paper disks at concentrations of 0.5 micrograms/ml (500 ng/ml). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective study was carried out to determine the usefulness of the CO2 laser in the management of patients with recurrent and metastatic intraabdominal tumors. Twenty-six intraabdominal procedures utilizing the laser were carried out on 24 patients at The Ohio State University between 1984 and 1988. This included 11 patients with recurrent adenocarcinoma of colonic origin, 3 patients with malignant carcinoid tumors, 3 patients with ovarian carcinomas, and one patient each with metastatic pheochromocytoma, appendix, breast, stomach, and lung carcinoma. In addition, there was one patient with pseudomyxoma peritoneii and one patient with both colonic and ovarian carcinoma. Tumors were located in the retroperitoneum (3), pelvis (2), liver (11), bowel serosa (5), diaphragm (4), mesentery (3), and peritoneal implants (3). The laser was used as an adjunct to standard surgical techniques and in most instances was combined with other operative procedures. Its use was greatest in cases where en bloc resection was impossible, as with hepatic lesions located near the hepatic veins or vena cava. Additional benefit was derived in cases where cytoreductive or debulking surgery was useful as in ovarian carcinoma and metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. All four patients with neuroendocrine tumors are still alive 3, 7, 12, and 56 months after surgery. In addition, symptom relief was apparent in all after surgery. All patients with ovarian carcinoma are also alive 9-29 months after surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90173682\r", 
  ".W": "Photokilling of pigmented mouse melanoma cells (B-16) was investigated using pulsed high intensity visible radiation. Melanin acts as an endogenous chromophore, and 694 nm radiation with 40 nsec pulse duration and 0.5-3 X 10(7)w/cm2 intensity causes cell death. Irradiation of non-pigmented human melanoma cells (U1) or human squamous carcinoma cells (FaDu) under similar conditions did not kill the cells. Also, irradiation of B-16 cells with 300 microsec laser pulses (10(3)W/cm2) or with continuous wave (CW) radiation (10(-3)W/cm2) did not kill the cells. These data indicate that pigmented cell killing is due to absorption of radiation by melanin and that the pulsewidth and intensity of radiation play important roles in cell killing. The generation of acoustic waves due to absorption of the pulsed radiation by pigmented cells and by isolated melanosomes was demonstrated at 532 and 625 nm and 8.5 nsec pulse duration (10(7)-10(8) W/cm2); the amplitudes of the acoustic signals were approximately 2.5-3.0-fold higher at 532 nm compared with 625 nm, and they increased with increasing fluence. In contrast, irradiation of U1 or FaDu cells with comparable fluences and intensities did not generate acoustic waves. A possible correlation between the generation of photoacoustic waves and pigment cell death is proposed. Since the thermal relaxation time of melanosomes is 0.5-1.0 microsec, the mechanism proposed is that thermal confinement of high intensity, short-pulse visible radiation generates acoustic waves by thermal expansion, leading to mechanical damage to the cells.\r"

Previous work had shown that a laser would induce breakdown of liposomes when a dye was encapsulated within the liposomes. The present investigation was performed to determine if release could be induced from liposomes that did not contain dye. In vitro, dynamic studies of the release of the drug from liposomes diluted in blood (flowing in a capillary tube at 40 microns/min) were conducted using an argon dye laser operating either in the blue-green mode (488/514 nm) or in the dye mode (577 nm). A radio-labeled marker was used to monitor the drug release. The results showed that the drug could indeed be released from liposomes that did not contain dye, at energy levels that are not likely to be harmful to the tissue. At identical power levels, the release of the drug was greater at 577 nm than at 488/514 nm, probably owing to the greater light absorbance of hemoglobin at the longer wavelength. The results indicate the potential for the site-specific release of a variety of molecules in the ocular vasculature.\r"

The aim of this study was to compare the tissue effect of three types of laser irradiation (Nd:YAG laser at 1.06 and 1.32 microns and holmium laser at 2.12 microns) on the rabbit endometrium. Crater formation, coagulation necrosis, and muscle necrosis were evaluated at the time of ablation, as well as at 1 week and 4 weeks postablation. The results were assessed by determining the depth and width of the affected portion in the uterine wall (lumen to serosa). It was shown that Nd:YAG laser at 1.32 microns caused more generalized and extended effects as compared with the other laser types examined. Endometrial regeneration was faster after ablation by the Nd:YAG laser at 1.06 microns and the holmium laser than by the Nd:YAG laser at 1.32 microns. The widest range of \"ablation energy\" (defined as that causing ablation without muscle damage) was achieved by applying the holmium laser. Further evaluation of the holmium laser for this indication is recommended.\r"

Damage zones thinner than 100 microns were readily produced using single pulses to cut guinea pig skin as well as bovine cornea, aorta, and myocardium. Multiple pulses can lead to increased damage. However, a systematic decrease in damage with irradiance, predicted theoretically by an evaporation model of ablation, was not observed. The damage-zone thickness was approximately constant around the periphery of the cut, consistent with the existence of a liquid layer which stores heat and leads to tissue damage, and with a model of damage and ablation recently proposed by Zweig et al.\r"

The probe diameter (1 mm) is small enough for use in coronary laser angioplasty, and the probe is shown to transmit laser light and receive fluorescent signals simultaneously. In a 2 mm diameter lumen, the spot width in a plane normal to the axis of the lens is about 2 mm and the lateral spot size is approximately 10 mm long. The ability to direct the probe's beam pattern angularly should provide flexibility in both diagnosis and treatment.\r"

A group of well-trained (8 male and 4 female) former endurance athletes was phlebotomized and 3-4 months later reinfused with the freezer-stored autologous red blood cells (RBC) from 1350 ml of blood. The [Hb] increased significantly (P less than 0.001 for both sexes) from 146.7 +/- 5.31 and 131.7 +/- 11.20 g. l-1 immediately before reinfusion to maximum values of 163.5 +/- 7.47 and 155.9 +/- 11.43 g.l-1 (mean +/- SD) in males and females, respectively, 2 d after reinfusion. S-iron increased transiently 5 h after reinfusion. S-bilirubin remained unchanged throughout the study. S-ferritin increased gradually (P less than 0.02) from 48 +/- 32.91 mmol.l-1 before reinfusion to a maximum of 80.8 +/- 39.52 mmol.l-1 2 wk after reinfusion. S-[Epo] increased transiently (P less than 0.01) from 8.83 +/- 2.51 (mean +/- SD) to 12.36 +/- 5.64 U.l-1, (mean +/- SD) 5 h after reinfusion. Subsequently, there was a significant marked decrease in s-[Epo] to 5.85 +/- 1.32 U.l-1, (mean +/- SD) 1 d after reinfusion (P less than 000.1, as compared to before reinfusion). Thereafter, s-[Epo] remained low throughout the study. Blood lactate was significantly decreased only the first 2 d after reinfusion (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The current consensus is that runners commonly experience a mild anemia influenced by iron deficiency. We compared hematologic parameters of 72 (35 males and 37 females) runners with 48 (27 males and 21 females) nonrunners and assessed the impact of iron supplementation. Male runners had lower hemoglobin (Hb) values than male nonrunners (14.8 vs 15.3 g.dl-1) (P less than 0.05) regardless of iron usage. Female runners had higher (P = 0.05) Hb values than female controls (13.5 vs 12.8 g.dl-1). Female runners off iron had Hbs similar to controls off iron (P = 0.30). Iron parameters (total serum iron, TSI; total iron-binding capacity, TIBC; percent saturation of the TIBC, %sat TIBC; and serum ferritin) of runners vs controls, runners vs runners (on or off iron), and nonrunners vs nonrunners (on or off iron) were comparable except 1) male runners off iron had lower (P less than 0.05) %sat TIBC values (26%) than male runners on iron (34%) and 2) female runners taking iron had ferritin values (32 ng.ml-1) similar to those of female nonrunners taking iron (39 ng.ml-1) but higher (P less than 0.05) than their counterparts off iron (15 and 15 ng.ml-1, respectively). This study concludes that running affects Hb in a variable manner and suggests that the runner's iron status is similar to that of the general population.\r"

Biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle before and after each exercise session. Glycogen content of the fibers was quantified as optical density (OD) using microspectrophotometric densitometry on serial cross-sections of muscle tissue stained with a periodic acid Schiff reagent stain after individual fibers were identified as ST or FT according to a stain for myofibrillar ATPase activity. Analysis of variance with repeated measures yielded the following results: OD, i.e., glycogen, was reduced similarly in both fiber types after exercise, but only in the males (P = 0.02); there was no significant main effect of training status per se (i.e., strength-trained vs untrained). These results indicate that years of strength training do not change the pattern of muscle fiber-specific glycogen utilization during repeated dynamic MVCs.\r"

Runners and swimmers did not differ significantly from each other with respect to this increase in VO2max; nor did they demonstrate significant changes in respiratory exchange ratio (RER) at VO2max between tests. The run-trained and swim-trained groups both experienced a decrease in HR at a standard submaximal walking workload but did not differ significantly from each other. Controls showed no significant change in submaximal exercise response. A significant difference was observed among groups (P less than 0.01) for change in percent body fat.

Ten trained male triathletes performed three cycle ergometer exercises: high intensity-short duration (HS), low intensity-short duration (LS), and low intensity-long duration (LL). Baseline VO2 was measured for 1 h prior to each exercise condition. Postexercise VO2 was measured continuously until baseline VO2 was achieved. The duration of EPOC was similar for HS (33 +/- 10 min) and LL (28 +/- 14 min), and both were significantly longer (P less than 0.05) than the EPOC following LS (20 +/- 5 min). However, total net caloric expenditure was significantly more (P less than 0.05) for HS (29 +/- 8 kcal) than for either LS (14 +/- 6 kcal) or LL (12 +/- 7 kcal). The exercise conditions used in this study did not produce a prolonged EPOC. However, the exercise intensity was shown to affect both the magnitude and duration of EPOC, whereas the exercise duration affected only the duration of EPOC. Moreover, the duration of EPOC and the subsequent caloric expenditure were not necessarily related. Based on the resulting magnitude of the postexercise energy expenditure, it is possible that EPOC may be of some value for weight control over the long term.\r"

Studies of circuit weight training in healthy adults and athletes have shown increases of 20-45% and cardiovascular improvement from 0 to 15%. An increasing number of exercise programs for cardiac and coronary prone populations have introduced circuit weight training. The few reported studies have shown that high risk patients can attain increases in fitness similar to those seen in healthy populations. Furthermore, the hemodynamic responses to circuit weight training suggest that it is a clinically safe and acceptable form of exercise.\r"

However, the accurate measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressure during exercise is difficult with auscultation and impractical with direct arterial techniques. The purpose of this study was to compare an automated system (Colin, Inc. STBP-680) with auscultation in humans during rest and exercise and to compare the automated system with direct arterial blood pressure measurement in a canine model during pharmacological challenges that resulted in a wide range of blood pressure values. Compared with direct arterial blood pressure taken in the canine model, the STBP-680 gave good estimates of diastolic blood pressure and adequately monitored relative changes in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure (mean arterial pressures in all instances were calculated as one-third systolic plus two-thirds diastolic blood pressures). Compared with auscultation methods in humans, the STBP-680 gave similar estimates of resting diastolic blood pressure and monitored relative changes in resting systolic blood pressures, diastolic blood pressures, and mean arterial pressures. During both treadmill and cycle ergometer exercise in humans, the STBP-680 monitored changes in systolic blood pressure, phase IV diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure. Further, the STBP-680 estimated exactly and noted relative changes in heart rate in every test. However, during exercise, quantitative estimations of systolic blood pressure by the STBP-680 were higher than those found using auscultation. Where exact, quantitative measures of blood pressure are needed, direct arterial measurement continues to be the most accurate method. However, where indirect methods can be used, the STBP-680 may provide a suitable alternative that reduces many of the technical concerns of auscultation in young, healthy individuals.\r"

  ".U": "90174215\r", 
  ".W": "The risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted disease as a result of rape is not known, in part because it is difficult to ascertain whether infections were present before the assault or acquired during it. To investigate this question, we examined female victims of rape within 72 hours of the assault and again at least one week after the assault. Of the 204 girls and women initially examined within 72 hours of the rape, 88 (43 percent) were found to have at least one sexually transmitted disease. These diseases included infections caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (6 percent of those tested), cytomegalovirus (8 percent), Chlamydia trachomatis (10 percent), Trichomonas vaginalis (15 percent), herpes simplex virus (2 percent), Treponema pallidum (1 percent), and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1; 1 percent) and bacterial vaginosis (34 percent). Among the 109 patients (53 percent) who returned for at least one follow-up visit (excluding those who were found to be infected at the first visit or who were treated prophylactically), the incidence of new disease was as follows: gonorrhea, 4 percent (3 of 71); chlamydial infection, 2 percent (1 of 65); trichomoniasis, 12 percent (10 of 81); and bacterial vaginosis, 19 percent (15 of 77). There were no new infections with herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, Trep. pallidum, or HIV-1, but follow-up serologic testing was performed in only 26 percent of the patients. On the basis of our assumptions that most venereal infections present within 72 hours of a rape were preexisting and that new infections identified 1 to 20 weeks later were acquired during the assault, we conclude that the prevalence of preexisting sexually transmitted diseases is high in victims of rape and that they have a lower but substantial additional risk of acquiring such diseases as a result of the assault.\r"

  ".U": "90174216\r", 
  ".W": "Infection is a frequent complication in patients undergoing hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease and is the primary cause of mortality among such patients. Macrophages are important in host defense against infection largely because their Fc gamma receptors recognize antibody-coated bacteria. We therefore studied macrophage Fc gamma-receptor function in vivo and in vitro in 56 patients with end-stage renal disease who were on hemodialysis and in 20 healthy volunteers. The clearance of IgG-coated (sensitized) autologous red cells was decreased in 53 patients. The inhibition of clearance in the 56 patients was 52 +/- 3 percent at 1 hour, 41 +/- 5 percent at 1 1/2 hours, and 29 +/- 5 percent at 2 hours (P less than 0.001). The clearance of unsensitized erythrocytes and heat-altered autologous erythrocytes was normal. The impairment of clearance was not correlated with age, sex, nutritional status, HLA haplotype, or the presence of circulating immune complexes. The recognition of these IgG-sensitized red cells in vitro by Fc gamma RI (an Fc gamma-receptor protein that binds monomeric IgG) on blood monocytes from the patients was also significantly decreased (P less than 0.001) but was partially improved by hemodialysis. Nine patients had severe infections during a two-year follow-up period. The clearance of IgG-coated cells in these patients (half-time, 12.9 +/- 1.7 hours) was significantly impaired, as compared with that in the 47 patients without severe infections (half-time, 4.4 +/- 1.8 hours; P less than 0.001). We conclude that macrophage Fc gamma-receptor function is impaired in patients with end-stage renal disease who are undergoing hemodialysis, and that this impairment probably contributes to the observed immunodepression and high prevalence of infection among such patients.\r"

We describe eight patients with MEN-1 and hypergastrinemia (seven with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) in whom we searched for neuroendocrine tumors in the pancreas and duodenum. Tumors were found in the proximal duodenum in all eight patients: solitary tumors (diameter, 6 to 20 mm) in three patients and multiple microtumors (diameter, 2 to 6 mm) in the other five. Paraduodenal lymph-node metastases were detected in four patients. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed the presence of gastrin in all the duodenal tumors and in their lymph-node metastases. In contrast, no immunoreactivity for gastrin was present in the endocrine tumors found in the seven pancreatic specimens available for study, except for one tumor with scattered gastrin-positive cells. In four of the six patients whose duodenal gastrinomas were removed, serum gastrin levels returned to normal; in the other two patients gastrin concentrations decreased toward normal. We conclude that in patients with MEN-1 and the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, gastrinomas occur in the duodenum, but the tumors may be so small that they escape detection.\r"

Nine patients (45 percent) who survived for more than one year form the basis of this report. Before surgery, the nine survivors had severe restrictive lung disease, with a mean (+/- SD) vital capacity (VC) of 43 +/- 9 percent, a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 50 +/- 9 percent, and a single-breath diffusing capacity (DLCO) of 36 +/- 9 percent of predicted values. One year after transplantation, the patients' VC had reached 69 +/- 10 percent, FEV1 79 +/- 15 percent, and DLCO 62 +/- 16 percent of predicted values. Relative perfusion to the transplanted lung rose from 63 +/- 14 percent (three days after surgery) to 77 +/- 7 percent within three months and stayed constant or increased slightly thereafter. Before surgery, despite supplemental oxygen at flow rates varying from 1 to 9 liters per minute, none of the patients could exercise beyond stage 1/2 (2.7 km [1.7 miles] per hour, 5 percent grade) on a modified Bruce treadmill-exercise protocol. All eight patients tested one year or more after transplantation achieved at least stage 1 (2.7 km [1.7 miles] per hour, 10 percent grade), and usually a higher stage, without supplemental oxygen. Arterial oxygen tension returned to normal values in most patients (87 +/- 13 mm Hg), and supplemental oxygen, which all patients required before surgery, was no longer needed by any patient after transplantation. We conclude that in carefully selected patients with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis, single-lung transplantation is an effective treatment.\r"

In 53 children who had received liver transplants, we examined the relation of height, weight, residual small-bowel length, and (in 17 children) the terminal plasma clearance rate of cyclosporine to the dose of cyclosporine required to achieve blood levels of 200 ng per milliliter. The required intravenous dose of cyclosporine (expressed as milligrams per day) increased steeply as body size and bowel length increased, whereas the required oral dose declined with increasing bowel length. When expressed as milligrams per square meter of body-surface area per day, the required intravenous dose did not change with body size, but the required oral dose declined with increasing body size. Small-bowel length correlated closely and inversely with the log of the oral dose of cyclosporine (r = -0.77, P = 0.0001). The rate of clearance was also related to the log of the oral dose (r = 0.57, P = 0.017) but was independent of age and size. Multiple regression analyses that included height and weight showed that only small-bowel length and the rate of clearance from plasma were independently related to the required oral dose of cyclosporine. We concluded that the length of the small bowel is the chief determinant of the required dose of orally administered cyclosporine in children after liver transplantation. Children and infants require large oral doses of cyclosporine because of the limited absorptive surface area of their intestines.\r"

We found that the proportion of non-U.S. papers published annually in these journals increased between two- and almost threefold, irrespective of whether the total number published per year rose (the Journal of Clinical Investigation and Blood), fell (the Lancet), or remained constant (the New England Journal of Medicine). Most non-U.S. research published in these periodicals originated in Western Europe or Japan. The limited available data on papers sent to the journals revealed a decline in the number of U.S. papers submitted in recent years (the New England Journal of Medicine) or a slower rate of increase relative to that of non-U.S. submissions (Blood), indicating that the increase in the number of non-U.S. papers published reflects an increase in the amount of high-quality research originating abroad as compared with the amount originating in the United States. The explanation for this phenomenon is unclear, but it coincides with the slowed growth of funding from the National Institutes of Health for U.S. clinical research.\r"

  ".U": "90174236\r", 
  ".W": "Recent neuroradiologic and neuropathological studies indicate that at least some patients with schizophrenia have slightly enlarged cerebral ventricles and subtle anatomical abnormalities in the region of the anterior hippocampus. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we studied 15 sets of monozygotic twins who were discordant for schizophrenia (age range, 25 to 44 years; 8 male and 7 female pairs). For each pair of twins, T1-weighted contiguous coronal sections (5 mm thick) were compared blindly, and quantitative measurements of brain structures were made with a computerized image-analysis system. In 12 of the 15 discordant pairs, the twin with schizophrenia was identified by visual inspection of cerebrospinal fluid spaces. In two pairs no difference could be discerned visually, and in one the twin with schizophrenia was misidentified. Quantitative analysis of sections through the level of the pes hippocampi showed the hippocampus to be smaller on the left in 14 of the 15 affected twins, as compared with their normal twins, and smaller on the right in 13 affected twins (both P less than 0.001). In the twins with schizophrenia, as compared with their normal twins, the lateral ventricles were larger on the left in 14 (P less than 0.003) and on the right in 13 (P less than 0.001). The third ventricle also was larger in 13 of the twins with schizophrenia (P less than 0.001). None of these differences were found in seven sets of monozygotic twins without schizophrenia who were studied similarly as controls. We conclude that subtle abnormalities of cerebral anatomy (namely, small anterior hippocampi and enlarged lateral and third ventricles) are consistent neuropathologic features of schizophrenia and that their cause is at least in part not genetic. Further study is required to determine whether these changes are primary or secondary to the disease.\r"

We conducted a population-based, randomized, 10-week dietary-supplementation trial in which the effects of 6 g per day of 85 percent eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids were compared with those of 6 g per day of corn oil in 156 men and women with previously untreated stable, mild essential hypertension. The mean systolic blood pressure fell by 4.6 mm Hg (P = 0.002), and diastolic pressure by 3.0 mm Hg (P = 0.0002) in the group receiving fish oil; there was no significant change in the group receiving corn oil. The differences between the groups remained significant for both systolic (6.4 mm Hg; P = 0.0025) and diastolic (2.8 mm Hg; P = 0.029) pressure after control for anthropometric, lifestyle, and dietary variables. The decreases in blood pressure were larger as concentrations of plasma phospholipid n-3 fatty acids increased (P = 0.027). Dietary supplementation with fish oil did not change mean blood pressure in the subjects who ate fish three or more times a week as part of their usual diet, or in those who had a base-line concentration of plasma phospholipid n-3 fatty acids above 175.1 mg per liter. We conclude that eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids reduce blood pressure in essential hypertension, depending on increases in plasma phospholipid n-3 fatty acids.\r"

  ".W": "To compare ondansetron (GR 38032F), a 5-hydroxytryptamine3-receptor antagonist, with metoclopramide in the prophylaxis of acute cisplatin-induced emesis, we conducted a double-blind crossover study in 97 patients scheduled to receive cisplatin (80 to 100 mg per square meter of body-surface area) for treatment of cancer. None had received chemotherapy before this trial. Among the 76 patients who satisfactorily completed both parts of the study, complete or nearly complete control of emesis (i.e., no episodes of emesis occurred, or only one or two) was achieved in 57 of 76 treatments (75 percent) with ondansetron and in 32 of 76 treatments (42 percent) with metoclopramide (P less than 0.001). Ondansetron was also more effective in controlling acute nausea, as assessed with a visual-analogue scale (P = 0.019) or a graded scale (P = 0.024). There was a significant preference among patients for ondansetron (55 vs. 26 percent; P = 0.006). Dystonic reactions were observed during three treatments with metoclopramide; both agents were otherwise well tolerated. We conclude that ondansetron is more effective than metoclopramide in the control of cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting, and that this suggests that serotonin is an important mediator of this side effect.\r"

There were no statistically significant differences in age, age at menarche, or reason for visiting the gynecologist. The percentages of women in this population who were sexually experienced were the same in all three years (88 percent in 1975, 87 percent in 1986, and 87 percent in 1989). Oral contraceptives were used by 55 percent of the women in 1975, 34 percent in 1986, and 42 percent in 1989; the use of condoms as the usual method of birth control increased (6 percent in 1975, 14 percent in 1986, and 25 percent in 1989; P less than 0.001). In 1975, only 12 percent reported the regular use of condoms during sexual intercourse, in some cases in conjunction with other methods of contraception, as compared with 21 percent in 1986 and 41 percent in 1989 (P = 0.0014). No significant differences were found in the three surveys in the number of male sexual partners or the frequency of fellatio, cunnilingus, or anal intercourse. An additional sample of 189 college women who did not consult the health service was surveyed in 1989, and similar sexual behavior was reported by those who were sexually experienced (65 percent). We conclude that in this population there has been little change in sexual practices in response to new and serious epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases, with the exception of an increase in the use of condoms (which still does not reach 50 percent).\r"

A special case of this problem arises when two independently moving gratings are superimposed. The gratings tend to cohere and move unambiguously in a single direction (pattern motion) instead of moving independently (component motion). Here we report that the tendency to see pattern motion depends very strongly on the luminance of the intersections (that is, to regions where the gratings overlap) relative to that of the gratings in a way that closely parallels the physics of transparency. When the luminance of these regions is chosen appropriately, pattern motion is destroyed and replaced by the appearance of two transparent gratings moving independently. The observations imply that motion detecting mechanisms in the visual system must have access to tacit 'knowledge' of the physics of transparency and that this knowledge can be used to segment the scene into different objects. The same knowledge could, in principle, be used to avoid confusing shadows with real object boundaries.\r"

These movements often involve the coordination of several neural networks, the output of which can be changed by modulatory substances. Here we report that the neuropeptide red pigment concentrating hormone modulates the interactions between two rhythmic pattern-generating networks in the lobster stomatogastric nervous system. Red pigment concentrating hormone markedly enhances the amplitude of synaptic interactions between elements of two pattern-generating networks--the cardiac sac and the gastric mill. Consequently, two networks operating under some circumstances virtually independently can be fused into one functional unit operating differently from either of the two original networks. These results show how a neuropeptide can alter the functional configuration of a neural network so that widely disparate outputs can be produced by the same neurons.\r"

  ".W": "During their intrathymic differentiation, T lymphocytes expressing alpha beta T-cell receptors (TCR) are negatively and positively selected. This selection contributes to the establishment of self-tolerance and ensures that mature CD4+ and CD8+ cell populations are restricted by the self major histocompatibility complex. Little is known, however, about gamma delta T-cell development. To investigate whether selection operates in the establishment of the gamma delta T-cell class, we have generated transgenic mice using gamma- and delta-transgenes encoding a TCR that is specific for a product of a gene in the TL-region of the TLb haplotype. Similar numbers of thymocytes expressing the transgenic TCR were generated in mice of TLb and TLd haplotypes. But gamma delta thymocytes from TLb and TLd transgenic mice differed in cell size, TCR density and in their capacity to respond to TLb stimulator cells or interleukin-2 (IL-2). In contrast to gamma delta T cells from TLd transgenic mice, gamma delta T cells from TLb transgenic mice did not produce IL-2 and did not proliferate in response to TLb stimulator cells, but they did proliferate in the presence of exogenous IL-2. These results indicate that functional inactivation of self-antigen-specific T cells could contribute to the establishment of self-tolerance to thymic determinants.\r"

  ".W": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disease caused by recessive mutations of the gene encoding the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The incidence of PKU varies widely across different geographic areas, and is highest (about 1 in 5,000 live births) in Ireland and western Scotland, and among Yemenite Jews. A limited number of point mutations account for most of the PKU cases in the European population. Here we report that a single molecular defect--a deletion spanning the third exon of the PAH gene--is responsible for all the PKU cases among the Yemenite Jews. Examination of a random sample of Yemenite Jews using a molecular probe that detects the carriers of this deletion indicated a high frequency of the defective gene in this community. Although the deleted PAH gene was traced to 25 different locations throughout Yemen, family histories and official documents of the Yemenite Jewish community showed that the common ancestor of all the carriers of this genetic defect lived in San'a, the capital of Yemen, before the eighteenth century.\r"

  ".U": "90174307\r", 
  ".W": "Targeted recombination in mammalian cells is rare compared with non-homologous integration. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the reverse is true. Differences in targeting efficiency could arise because a target of unique DNA is 200 times more dilute in mammalian genomes than it is in yeast. We tested this possibility by measuring gene targeting in normal CHO cells with two copies of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene and in amplified CHOC 400 cells, which carry 800 copies. If the concentration of the target gene is critical, amplified cells should show an enhanced frequency of targeted recombination relative to non-homologous integration. Using a positive/negative selection protocol, we demonstrated that the efficiency of targeting into DHFR genes is indistinguishable in normal and amplified CHO cells. As targeting does not depend on the number of targets, the search for homology is not a rate-limiting step in the mammalian pathway of gene targeting. Thus, the difference in genome size is not the basis for the different outcomes of targeting experiments in S. cerevisiae and mammals.\r"

  ".W": "The Escherichia coli phage 434 repressor binds as a dimer to the operator of the DNA helix. Although the centre of the operator is not in contact with protein, the repressor binding affinity can be reduced at least 50-fold by changing the sequence there: operators with A.T base pairs near their centre bind the repressor more strongly than do operators with G.C base pairs at the same positions. To explain these observations, it has been proposed that the base composition at the centre of the operator affects the affinity of the operator for repressor by altering the ease with which operator DNA can undergo the torsional deformation necessary for complex formation. In this model, the variation in binding affinity would require the torsion constant to have specific values and to change in a sequence-dependent manner. We have now measured torsion constants for DNAs with widely different base compositions. Our results indicate that the torsion constants depend only slightly on the overall composition, and firmly delimit the range of values for each. Even the upper-limit values are much too small to account for the observed changes in affinity of the 434 repressor. These results rule out simple models that rely on substantial generic differences in torsion constant between A.T-rich sequences and G.C-rich sequences, although they do not rule out the possibility of particular sequences having abnormal torsion constants.\r"

The method allows accurate, reliable measurement of negative as well as positive pressures. We describe the derangement of postural intraventricular pressure regulation caused by placement of a shunt, as well as the influence of various shunt systems and the antisiphon device on this problem. Ventriculoatrial, ventriculoperitoneal, and ventriculopleural shunts all caused similar severely abnormal postural intracranial pressure relationships. The antisiphon device was generally effective in restoring normal pressures in patients in the upright position. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the mechanisms of postural intracranial pressure regulation in patients without hydrocephalus.\r"
