  ".W": "The tissue distribution and levels of estrogen receptor in neonatal mouse uterine tissue were determined in epithelial and stromal fractions separated by mild enzymatic treatment. Proteins of the isolated fractions were separated by gel electrophoresis and receptor was detected on immunoblots with monoclonal antibody H-222. Estrogen receptor protein was detectable in samples of reproductive tract tissue from 5- and 10-day-old mice. The level of receptor in 5-day-old animals was lower per unit DNA in epithelial cells than in stroma. Receptor levels were increased in both tissue types after treatment with diethylstilbestrol, but not with progesterone. Receptor protein present in these neonatal tissues was able to bind steroid as evidenced by affinity labeling with tamoxifen aziridine. Immunohistochemistry on sections of uteri from 4- and 10-day-old mice confirmed the biochemical results and indicated lower nuclear straining in epithelial cells than in stromal cells of uteri of 4-day-old mice. These results demonstrated that estrogen receptor protein is present in both epithelium and stroma of the neonatal mouse uterus, but at a higher level in stromal cells.\r"

Simple parameterizations of the hyperboloid model are then used to determine the constraints that govern key parameters, such as the number of strands in the barrel, and to rationalize the remarkable conservation of strand number, observed to be eight, in nearly all the known examples of parallel beta-barrels. It is shown that the requirement to exclude solvent from the barrel interior, while at the same time keeping an upper limit on strand twist and interstrand distance so as to foster extensive hydrogen bonding interactions within the sheet, imposes strong constraints on barrel geometry. A formal description of the relationships between beta-sheet twist, strand number, and barrel dimensions is given here. It could have important implications for studies of protein folding and design.\r"

It was found that the native protein is maximally stable at about 20 degrees C and is denatured upon heating and cooling from this temperature. The heat and cold denaturation processes are approximated rather well by a two-state transition showing that the molecule is composed of a single cooperative system. The main difference between these two processes is in the sign of the enthalpy and entropy of denaturation: whereas the heat denaturation proceeds with increases in the enthalpy and entropy, the cold denaturation proceeds with decreases in both quantities. The inversion of the enthalpy sign occurs at about 15 degrees C in an acetate buffer, but this temperature can be raised by addition of urea to the solvent.\r"

  ".W": "In rats chronically consuming ethanol, the liver mitochondrial membranes develop resistance to the disordering effects of ethanol in vitro, so-called \"membrane tolerance\". To investigate the molecular basis of this tolerance in the inner mitochondrial membrane, multilamellar vesicles were produced by recombining the mitoplast phospholipids (quantitatively separated by preparative HPLC) from control and ethanol-fed animals in various combinations. The effect of in vitro ethanol on the physical properties of these vesicles was determined by electron spin resonance. Vesicles composed of all mitoplast phospholipids from control rats were disordered by 50-100 mM ethanol, whereas those made of the phospholipids from ethanol-fed animals were resistant. When phosphatidylcholine (46 mol %) or phosphatidylethanolamine (42 mol %) from ethanol-fed rats replaced the corresponding phospholipids of control rats, the vesicles were disordered by ethanol. By contrast, when as little as 2.5 mol % of cardiolipin (one-fourth the naturally occurring amount) from ethanol-fed rats replaced that phospholipid from control rats, vesicles were rendered entirely resistant to disordering by ethanol. The same amount of cardiolipin from ethanol-fed rats also conferred membrane tolerance to vesicles composed of bovine phospholipids, demonstrating that this effect is not restricted to rat mitoplast phospholipids. In vesicles composed of a single mitoplast-phospholipid class, only vesicles composed of cardiolipin from ethanol-fed rats resisted disordering. Phosphatidylinositol from liver microsomes of ethanol-fed rats also confers membrane tolerance and was the only microsomal phospholipid that formed tolerant vesicles. Thus, in livers of rats chronically fed ethanol, anionic phospholipids are selectively converted into potent promoters of membrane tolerance in both mitochondrial and microsomal membranes.\r"

To further characterize the two less prevalent elongated variants, we have purified the three forms of the gamma chain, isolated unique tryptic fragments, and sequenced the variant portions of each chain. The intermediate-sized form (gamma 55) has a sequence identical to the longest variant (gamma 57.5) from residue Val-408 to Pro-423, which is the C terminus of the gamma 55 chain. The gamma 57.5 chain extends an additional four amino acids. The C-terminal amino acid sequence and corresponding nucleotide sequence of the gamma 55 chain show marked similarity with an elongated gamma-chain variant of rat fibrinogen. In addition, a remarkable similarity in both amino acid and nucleotide sequence was noted between the human gamma 55 chain and the C-terminal extension in human and bovine A alpha chain of fibrinogen, which are encoded by the cDNA but are posttranslationally cleaved and are not found in plasma. The findings suggest an evolutionary conservation in the C-terminal amino acid sequence found in both the fibrinogen A alpha and gamma chains in several species.\r"

Two cDNAs were isolated by hybridization to oligonucleotide probes designed to encode tryptic peptides isolated from S6KII. The two cDNAs show 91% sequence similarity to each other. These two cDNAs predict proteins of 733 (S6KII alpha) and 629 (S6KII beta) amino acids that show 95% sequence similarity over the 629 amino acids where they are colinear. Amino acids 44-733 of S6KII alpha were expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant protein was used to raise antiserum in rabbits. This antiserum reacted with authentic S6KII prepared from Xenopus eggs. This interaction was specifically blocked by the recombinant protein from E. coli. The sequences of S6KII alpha and -beta predict four tryptic peptides whose sequences are identical to four peptides isolated from a tryptic digest of S6KII. The S6KII proteins have a very unusual structure when compared with previously studied protein kinases. They contain two apparent kinase domains, each similar to distinct protein kinases. The amino-terminal 366 amino acids show high sequence similarity to the regions of protein kinase C, the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase that contain the sites for ATP binding and are believed to be the catalytic centers for phosphotransferase activity. The remainder of the S6 kinase molecule shows high sequence similarity to the ATP-binding and presumed catalytic domain of the catalytic subunit of phosphorylase b kinase.\r"

  ".W": "Allene oxides are unstable epoxides that have been implicated as intermediates in the biotransformation of hydroperoxyicosatetraenoic acids and related hydroperoxides to ketols and cyclopentenones. Direct proof of the structure of the putative allene oxide intermediates has been hampered by their extreme instability under the conditions of their biosynthesis (t1/2 approximately 15-30 sec at 0 degree C and pH 7.4). We now report the isolation and structural elucidation of allene oxides prepared from the (13S)-hydroperoxides of linoleic and linolenic acids. The compounds were biosynthesized by using a very active enzyme preparation from flaxseed. After a 5-sec incubation at 0 degrees C, the allene oxide metabolites were extracted and purified as the methyl ester derivatives at -15 degrees C. The structures were established by UV, CD, NMR, and oxygen-18 labeling experiments. 12,13(S)-Oxido-9Z,11-octadecadienoic acid is derived from linoleic acid, and 12,13(S)-oxido-9Z,11,15Z-octadecatrienoic acid is from linolenic acid. Analysis of the breakdown products formed on exposure to water led to identification of hydrolysis and cyclization products previously characterized as enzymic derivatives of the (13S)-hydroperoxides in flaxseed. Our results give direct proof of the structure of the allene oxide intermediates and should facilitate further investigation of the metabolism of this class of epoxide to prostaglandins, clavulones, and other stable end products.\r"

Here we report the purification of protein BPP23 from chick cochlea and the generation of a specific antiserum. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments with this antiserum indicate that BPP23 is a calcium-binding protein very similar, if not identical, to avian calbindin, the 28-kDa vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein. Although the basilar papilla contains both receptor hair cells and supporting cells, immunocytochemical studies by others have localized calbindin-like immunoreactivity to the hair cells in the rat auditory receptor epithelium. Our estimates of the abundance of protein BPP23, assuming exclusive localization within the hair cell, indicate a concentration of at least 1 mM. Avian calbindin has four high-affinity (Kd = 0.5 X 10(-6)) calcium-binding sites. The presence of a specific calcium-binding activity at such high levels suggests an important function for cochlear calbindin (BPP23) in hair cell calcium homeostasis and auditory transduction.\r"

Furthermore, we show that binding of ATF to these promoter elements is required for the constitutive in vitro transcriptional activity of the cAMP-inducible somatostatin gene. Taken together, our results suggest that a common cellular transcription factor, ATF, can be regulated in vivo by two apparently unrelated inducing agents: the adenovirus E1a protein and cAMP.\r"

  ".U": "88217910\r", 
  ".W": "For the polypentapeptide of elastin, (L-Val-L-Pro-Gly-L-Val-Gly)n, and appropriate analogs when suitably cross-linked, it has been previously demonstrated that development of elastomeric force at fixed length and length changes at fixed load occur as the result of an inverse temperature transition, with the temperature of the transition being inversely dependent on the hydrophobicity of the polypeptide. This suggests that at fixed temperature a chemical means of reversibly changing the hydrophobicity could be used for mechanochemical coupling. Evidence for this mechanism of mechanochemical coupling is given here with a 4%-Glu-polypentapeptide, in which the valine in position 4 is replaced in 1 out of 5 pentamers by a glutamic acid residue. Before cross-linking, the temperature for aggregation of 4%-Glu-polypentapeptide is remarkably sensitive to pH, shifting from 25 degrees C at pH 2 to 70 degrees C at pH 7.4 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). At 37 degrees C, the cross-linked 4%-Glu-polypentapeptide matrix in PBS undergoes a pH-modulated contraction and relaxation with a change from pH 4.3 to 3.3 and back. The mean distance between carboxylates at pH 4.3 in the elastomeric matrix is greater than 40 A, twice the mean distance between negatively charged species in PBS. Accordingly, charge-charge repulsion is expected to make little or no contribution to the coupling. Mechanochemical coupling is demonstrated at fixed load by monitoring pH dependence of length and at constant length by monitoring pH dependence of force. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of mechanochemical coupling in a synthetic polypeptide and the first system to provide a test of the recent proposal that chemical modulation of an inverse temperature transition can be a mechanism for mechanochemical coupling. It is suggested that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation may modulate structure and forces in proteins by locally shifting the temperatures of inverse temperature transitions.\r"

In cell pairs exhibiting low gap junctional conductance (less than 500 pS), single-channel events with a unitary conductance of 53 +/- 2 pS (5 experiments; 186 events) were apparent. Event duration and open-time probability were estimated to be 0.95 sec and 0.17, respectively. When the junctional conductance in well-coupled cell pairs (with initial junctional conductance, greater than 5 nS) was reduced by cytoplasmic acidification or application of heptanol, single-channel events could be visualized. Compared to low-conductance controls, unitary channel conductance was unaltered (for acidification the conductance was 58 +/- 3 pS in 11 experiments with 253 events; for heptanol the conductance was 61 +/- 1 pS in 2 experiments with 171 events), while the probability of channels being open was decreased. The constancy of unitary channel conductance under control conditions and during uncoupling procedures suggests that opening and closing of the gap junction channel are all-or-none processes during which no stable subconductance states are formed.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that neuroblastoma cells and several types of primary neuronal cells in culture rapidly extend neurites when switched from serum-containing to serum-free medium. The present studies on cloned neuroblastoma cells show that thrombin blocked this spontaneous differentiation at 2 nM with a half-maximal potency of 50 pM. This required the catalytic activity of thrombin and was reversed upon thrombin removal. Thrombin also caused cells in serum-free medium to retract their neurites at equally low concentrations. Two other serine proteases, urokinase and plasmin, did not block or reverse neurite extension even at 100-fold higher concentrations. A specific assay for thrombin indicated that thrombin detected in serum-containing medium from neuroblastoma cultures was derived from serum and that it was likely responsible for much of the known capacity of serum to maintain neuroblastoma cells in a nondifferentiated state. This was supported by the finding that heparin addition reduced the thrombin concentration in serum-containing medium and stimulated neurite outgrowth from neuroblastoma cells in serum-containing medium. Studies on the ability of thrombin to modulate neurite outgrowth by other agents showed that it blocked and reversed the neurite outgrowth activity of two thrombin inhibitors: protease nexin-1 (which is identical to glial-derived neurite-promoting factor) and hirudin. Thrombin, however, did not block the neurite-promoting activity of dibutyryl cAMP or prostaglandin E1. These results suggest a specific role for thrombin in control of neurite outgrowth.\r"

In the present study we have used several approaches to elucidate the mechanism for the paracrine transfer of retinol between liver parenchymal and stellate cells. In one series of experiments, chylomicrons labeled with [3H]retinyl palmitate or with retinyl [3H]palmitate were injected intravenously into rats. It was shown that the retinol as well as the palmitate moiety were initially taken up in parenchymal liver cells. However, only the retinol moiety was detected in stellate cells, indicating that the retinyl ester is hydrolyzed before retinol is transferred to stellate cells. It is well known that parenchymal liver cells secrete retinol bound to retinol-binding protein (RBP), and we have recently found that stellate cells do have RBP receptors. Here we report that antibodies against RBP completely block the transfer of retinol from parenchymal to stellate cells. These findings indicate that following uptake of chylomicron remnant retinyl ester in parenchymal cells, the retinyl ester is hydrolyzed, and retinol secreted from parenchymal cells on RBP is taken up by stellate cells by means of RBP receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Growth of germinal cells at different angular positions within the posterior portion of the embryonic frog eye has been examined by orthotopically transplanting small groups of germinal cells from pigmented (stage 30-38) donor embryos into albino (stage 28-36) hosts and then serially photographing the polyclonal-cell progeny domain (typically a black sector) in the pigmented retinal epithelium of the living, growing eye. Far-ventral (6 o'clock) germinal cells formed a narrow sector along the ventral fissure, but ventral germinal cells at a position just posterior to the fissure (7 o'clock on a right eye) were seen to expand rapidly their angular territory on the germinal zone and formed huge sectors that widened toward the front of the older larval eye. Posterior (8, 9, and 10 o'clock) germinal cells were seen to shift their angular positions gradually toward dorsal and formed sectors that appeared to veer dorsalward nearing the front of the older eye. Dorsal (11 o'clock) germinal cells showed attenuative growth, forming sectors that narrowed approaching the front of the older eye. A simulation model of the growth dynamic was used to examine how expansive growth ventrally drives the positional variations in growth. When far-ventral germinal cells were programmed to retain the 6 o'clock position and ventral (7 o'clock) germinal cells were programmed to divide symmetrically at a high probability to produce two daughter germinal cells, not only were the observed ventral chimeric patterns simulated, but also simulated were the attenuative growth of dorsal transplants and the dorsal displacement and veering seen in the growth of posterior transplants.\r"

  ".U": "88217921\r", 
  ".W": "By using an immunological and peptide mapping approach two calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules (calCAMs) in the embryonic chicken are compared. A third closely related molecule is identified and compared to the two calCAMs. One of the calCAMs appears to be identical to the previously identified adhesion molecule N-cadherin, originally identified in chicken retina and localized to neural tissues. The second is the same as L-CAM, originally identified in chicken liver but localized to a variety of epithelial tissues. The third, also found in liver, is similar to L-CAM but is much closer in structure to N-cadherin. It is, however, immunologically distinct from N-cadherin. We therefore refer to this newly identified molecule as CRM-L for cadherin-related molecule in liver. CRM-L, N-cadherin, and L-CAM are all cell-surface proteins with a similar stability to tryptic digestion in the presence of calcium. CRM-L has the same molecular mass and isoelectric point as N-cadherin but is distinct from L-CAM in these properties. Two-dimensional peptide maps of complete tryptic digests reveal that CRM-L shares 69% of its peptides with N-cadherin and 20% with L-CAM. On the basis of these data, we suggest that there are at least two distinguishable types of calCAMs in the chicken embryo: one represented by the closely related molecules N-cadherin and CRM-L, and another represented by L-CAM.\r"

  ".W": "Using a rapid rRNA sequencing technique, we have determined the sequence of the 400 nucleotides located at the 5' end of the large subunit rRNA molecule from eight species of unicellular eukaryotes (protists). This region contains a pair of conservative domains well-suited for long-range phylogenetic evaluations among eukaryotes, due both to their substantia, length and to their intrinsic rate of sequence variation during evolution. It also comprises a central more rapidly evolving portion, which allows for a fine tuning of distance evaluation between closely related species. Molecular distances were computed between the aligned nucleotides of all presently available protist sequences and were used to derive a tentative dendrogram. Within the limitations inherent to this approach, a number of interesting observations emerge: The various protist groups appear to have separated very early from each other. The most deeply divergent protists belong to a number of orders of flagellates (mastigotes), suggesting a very ancient origin for organelles containing a 9 + 2 microtubular arrangement. Ciliates emerged late among eukaryotes, suggesting that their peculiar genetic code was derived secondarily. Moreover, a dinoflagellate clusters with ciliates, thus making it likely that the unusual features of nuclear organization and mitosis of this group are not primitive but derived characters. Finally, within groups, taxonomic and evolutionary inferences appear to be feasible using this portion of the rRNA.\r"

We have demonstrated that duck delta-crystallin has enormously high ASL activity, while chicken delta-crystallin has lower but significant activity. The lenses of these birds had much greater ASL activity than other tissues, suggesting that ASL is being expressed at unusually high levels as a structural component. In Southern blots of human genomic DNA, chicken delta 1-crystallin cDNA hybridized only to the human ASL gene; moreover, the two chicken delta-crystallin genes accounted for all the sequences in the chicken genome able to cross-hybridize with a human ASL cDNA, with preferential hybridization to the delta 2 gene. Correlations of enzymatic activity and recent data on mRNA levels in the chicken lens suggest that ASL activity depends on expression of the delta 2-crystallin gene. The data indicate that the same gene, at least in ducks, encodes two different functions, an enzyme (ASL) and a structural protein (delta-crystallin), although in chickens specialization and separation of functions may have occurred.\r"

Blot hybridization of human genomic DNA to nonoverlapping cDNA fragments revealed multiple bands, many of which hybridize with two or more probes in a manner inconsistent with the existence of a single GLUD gene. Moreover, two separate 36-base synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the coding region hybridize to multiple genomic fragments, confirming the existence of more than one GLUD-related gene in human.\r"

We have examined the distribution of DR and DQ beta-chain and DQ alpha-chain alleles in PV patients and in control subjects by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes and sequence analysis of in vitro amplified DNA. Ninety percent (34/38) of the DR4 haplotypes in patients contain a specific DR beta I sequence present in 36% (16 of 44) of DR4 controls (P = 0.001). This sequence is also found in DRw6 haplotypes. However, it is present in only 25% (6 of 24) of DRw6 patients. The results of our analysis indicate that predisposition to PV is conferred by different sequences in DR4 and DRw6 haplotypes. The DR4 susceptibility is highly associated with the Dw10 DR beta I allele, implicating the polymorphic residues in the third hypervariable region. The DRw6 susceptibility is strongly associated with a rare DQ beta allele (DQB1.3). This allele differs from a common DQ beta allele (DQB1.1) only by a valine----aspartic acid substitution at position 57.\r"

  ".W": "In view of the widespread occurrence of gene families in eukaryotic genomes that suggests the importance of gene duplication in evolution, a population genetic model incorporating unequal crossing-over was formulated. By using this model, the time needed for acquiring a new gene is investigated by an approximate analytical method and by computer simulations. The model assumes that natural selection favors those chromosomes with more beneficial genes than other chromosomes in the population, as well as random genetic drift, mutation, and unequal crossing-over. Starting from a single gene copy, it is found that the time for acquiring another gene with a new function is dependent on the rates of occurrence of unequal crossing-over and mutation. Within a realistic range of parameter values, the required time was at least several times 4N generations, where N is the effective population size. Interchromosomal unequal crossing-over at meiosis is more effective than intrachromosomal (between sister chromatids) unequal crossing-over for obtaining a new gene, provided that other parameters are the same. However, the genetic load for acquiring a gene is larger under the model of interchromosomal crossing-over. The relevance of this finding to the advantage of sexual reproduction is discussed.\r"

To circumvent the problems associated with the inaccessibility of human tissues and a lack of sensitive methods to detect DNA damage, we have investigated the capability of human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro to metabolize carcinogens to their DNA binding species by a 32P-labeled adduct assay. Freshly isolated lymphocytes were exposed at 37 degrees C for 18 hr to 4-aminobiphenyl, 2-aminofluorene, 2-anthramine, 2-acetylaminophenanthrene, benzidine, 1-nitropyrene, 1,2-benzanthracene, triphenylene, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, or benzo[a]pyrene at 30 microM each, compounds that are shown or suspected to be carcinogenic in experimental animals. Anthracene, pyrene, and perylene were included as noncarcinogenic controls. Our data indicate that all test carcinogens formed readily measurable levels of DNA adducts. Analysis of exposed DNAs by 32P-labeling after digestion and adduct enrichment showed exclusively or predominantly one major adduct for all test carcinogens, except for 2-anthramine, triphenylene, and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, which showed two or three adducts, in the range of 8-1500 amol/micrograms of DNA. No DNA binding was detected for the noncarcinogens. From 12 lymphocyte specimens studied thus far, significant interindividual variations were observed for 2-aminofluorene (62-fold), 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (10-fold), benzidine (19-fold) and benzo[a]pyrene (18-fold) in their capacity to bind to the lymphocyte DNA. The lymphocyte system in combination with the 32P-adduct assay may prove to be an ultrasensitive means to determine interindividual variations in the ability to biotransform carcinogens.\r"

Antibody against human placental MCM was used to screen human placenta and liver cDNA expression libraries for MCM cDNA clones. One clone expressed epitopes that could affinity-purify antibodies against MCM. A cDNA corresponding in length to the mRNA was obtained and introduced into COS cells by DNA-mediated gene transfer. Cells transformed with this clone expressed increased levels of MCM enzymatic activity. RNA blot analysis of cells genetically deficient in MCM indicates that several deficient cell lines have a specific decrease in the amount of hybridizable mRNA. These data confirm the authenticity of the MCM cDNA clone, establish the feasibility of constituting MCM activity by gene transfer for biochemical analysis and gene therapy, and provide a preliminary picture of the genotypic spectrum underlying MCM deficiency.\r"

The RNA.RNA heteroduplexes containing a variable number of base mismatches were digested with RNase A, and the resistant products were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We show that many of these single base mismatches are cleaved by RNase A, generating unique and characteristic patterns of resistant RNA fragments specific for each of the different viral strains. Comparative analysis of the cleavage patterns allows a qualitative estimation of the genetic relatedness and evolution of field strains. We also show that cleavage by RNase A at single base mismatches can readily detect and localize point mutations present in monoclonal antibody-resistant variants. This method should have wide applications in the study of RNA viruses, not only for epidemiological analysis but also in some diagnostic problems, such as characterization of phenotypic mutants.\r"

Skin fibroblasts cultured from patients with all types of cystinosis show increased intralysosomal free (nonprotein) cystine; however, fibroblasts from heterozygotes have normal free-cystine values. To determine whether genetic complementation occurs between the different forms, somatic cell hybrids were constructed between cells from a patient with infantile nephropathic cystinosis and cells from patients with other types of cystinosis. If complementation occurred, the hybrids would be expected to have normal cystine levels. To construct hybrid cells, a \"universal parent\" cell type (TG1-neo), which was hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine (HAT) sensitive and G418 resistant was constructed from an infantile nephropathic cystinosis fibroblast strain. Polyethylene glycol fusion of TG1-neo with other cells that are not HAT sensitive or G418 resistant allowed for selection of hybrid cells in a medium containing HAT and the aminoglycoside G418. As indicated by elevated cystine levels, complementation did not occur between TG1-neo and two different benign cystinosis strains, an intermediate cystinosis strain, or another nephropathic cystinosis cell strain. When a normal fibroblast strain was fused with TG1-neo, all 15 hybrid clones studied contained normal amounts of intracellular free cystine.\r"

  ".W": "TL (thymus leukemia) antigens are encoded by genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the mouse. Although similar in overall structure to other class I MHC antigens (H-2, Qa), TL expression is regulated in a highly distinctive fashion. In contrast to the broad distribution of H-2 and the intermediate distribution of Qa, TL expression is restricted to cells of T-cell derivation during development in the thymus and is lost when T cells migrate to the periphery. Some mouse strains do not express TL antigens on thymocytes (TL- strains), but leukemias occurring in these mice can have a TL+ phenotype, indicating activation of normally silent TL genes. In transfection studies with H-2 or TL genes in L cells (mouse fibroblasts), H-2 is expressed at high levels, whereas TL is poorly expressed. To identify genetic elements that regulate expression in transfected L cells, chimeric genes were constructed by transposing the 5' and 3' regions of TL and H-2 genes. Antigen expression was not influenced by transposing the cytoplasmic domain and 3' untranslated region. In contrast, interchanging the 5' flanking sequences and exon 1 had a marked influence on antigen expression, with 5' sequences from the H-2 gene increasing TL expression 10- to 50-fold, and 5' sequences from the TL gene markedly decreasing H-2 expression. With both the parental TL gene (p20-TL) and the highly expressed chimeric TL gene (construct 3), levels of TL mRNA and TL antigen correlated with the number of transfected gene copies. However, in cells transfected with equal copy numbers, much higher levels of TL mRNA and TL antigen were found in construct-3 transfectants than in p20-TL transfectants. In addition, there was marked heterogeneity in TL mRNA size in L cells transfected with p20-TL, in contrast to a more homogeneous transcript size in construct-3 transfectants. These results point to regulatory sequences in the 5' flanking region of class I genes that control proper initiation and processing of TL transcripts.\r"

Plasma membrane vesicles partially purified from multidrug-resistant human KB carcinoma cells, but not from drug-sensitive cells, accumulate [3H]vinblastine in an ATP-dependent manner. This transport is osmotically sensitive, with an apparent Km of 38 microM for ATP and of approximately equal to 2 microM for vinblastine. The nonhydrolyzable analog adenosine 5'-[beta, gamma-imido]triphosphate does not substitute for ATP but is a competitive inhibitor of ATP for the transport process. Vanadate, an ATPase inhibitor, is a potent noncompetitive inhibitor of transport. These results indicate that hydrolysis of ATP is probably required for active transport of vinblastine. Several other drugs to which multidrug-resistant cell lines are resistant inhibit transport, with relative potencies as follows: vincristine greater than actinomycin D greater than daunomycin greater than colchicine = puromycin. Verapamil and quinidine, which reverse the multidrug-resistance phenotype, are good inhibitors of the transport process. These results confirm that multidrug-resistant cells express an energy-dependent plasma membrane transporter for hydrophobic drugs, and establish a system for the detailed biochemical analysis of this transport process.\r"

A fusion polypeptide containing 37 kDa of the Escherichia coli TrpE protein (anthranilate synthase) and 55 kDa of the cloned protein was recognized in immunoblot experiments with antisera raised against a partially purified preparation of the approximately equal to 60-kDa protective filarial antigen. These data relate the cloned antigen to a potentially protective antigen in lymphatic filariasis.\r"

Whole-cell current-clamp and voltage-clamp recordings indicated that the cells remained electrically excitable after dissociation. Cell-attached recordings frequently revealed single-channel openings in the presence of dopamine or of the D2 dopamine agonist quinpirole. Channel openings were rarely or never observed in the absence of drugs or in the presence of quinpirole plus the dopamine antagonist haloperidol. The D2 antagonist spiperone was more potent at blocking the appearance of the channel than was the D1 antagonist SCH-23390. The channel reversal potential varied with the extracellular K+ concentration as predicted by the Nernst equation. The channel current-voltage relationship was linear, with a conductance of approximately equal to 85 pS in the presence of 140 mM KCl. These results are consistent with the opening of single K+ channels following D2 dopamine receptor activation.\r"

The highest levels of hybridization in adult brain were associated with neurons, primarily in telencephalic structures. The dense labeling associated with hippocampal pyramidal cells was reduced significantly when the cells were eliminated by injection of the neurotoxin ibotenic acid but was not affected when electrolytic lesions were placed in the medial septum. Since the gene encoding amyloid precursor protein has been localized to mouse chromosome 16, we also examined the expression of this gene in the brains of mouse embryos with trisomy 16 and trisomy 19 at 15 days of gestation. RNA gel blot analysis and in situ hybridization showed a marked increase in amyloid precursor protein mRNA in the trisomy 16 mouse head and brain when compared with euploid littermates or with trisomy 19 mice.\r"

Neurons expressing highest levels of GAP-43 mRNA were found by in situ hybridization to be concentrated in layer 2 of association cortex and in hippocampal pyramidal cells. Control studies showed that several other RNAs had regional distributions that were different from GAP-43, although the mRNA encoding the precursor of the Alzheimer amyloid beta protein followed a similar pattern of expression. These results suggest that a restricted subset of cortical and hippocampal neurons may be specialized for synaptic remodeling and might play a role in information storage in the human brain.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the role of delta sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP) in sleep-related growth hormone (GH) release, male rats were deprived of sleep for 4 hr by placing them on a slowly rotating wheel. Sleep deprivation by this method caused a significant increase in GH release, as indicated by the increase in plasma GH concentrations (P less than 0.01), and also in the amount of slow-wave sleep (SWS) (P less than 0.001) above initial values after removal of the animals from the rotating wheel. These increases were blocked by microinjection into the third cerebral ventricle of highly specific antiserum to DSIP. In control rats receiving an equal volume of normal rabbit serum, the significant increase in plasma GH as well as SWS remained after removal of the rats from the wheel. The increased release of endogenous DSIP in the sleep-deprived animals may have caused an increase in SWS as well as plasma GH. Since DSIP increases plasma GH after its injection into the third cerebral ventricle and since passive immunization against DSIP blocks the increase in SWS and GH release that follows the 4 hr of sleep deprivation, the results suggest that DSIP can be a physiological stimulus for sleep-related GH release as well as for the induction of SWS.\r"

While syntactical features play a role in interspecific song recognition by males of many bird species, syntax variation within species and female responsiveness to song syntax have received little attention. This report demonstrates that differences in naturally occurring learned song syntax within a species whose syntax varies geographically are behaviorally salient to both male and female birds. The salience of culturally transmitted intraspecific differences in song syntax has implications for the process of conspecific song perception and may be involved in the regulation of genetic exchange between large populations of swamp sparrows (Melospiza georgiana).\r"

Analysis in vitro showed that the radioimmunoconjugate was selectively cytotoxic to a Thy 1.2+ EL-4 murine tumor cell line. Approximately three bismuth-212-labeled immunoconjugates per target cell reduced the uptake of [3H]thymidine by the EL-4 target cells to background levels.

A molecular recognition theory based on the translation of coding and noncoding DNA strands was used to identify complementary amino acid sequences responsible for self-binding. The second hypervariable region of the heavy chain domain, extending into the third framework region, was predicted as the primary self-binding locus. Among peptides synthesized with different variable heavy and light chain regions, a 24-residue peptide spanning the second hypervariable and third framework regions of the heavy chain of T15 was nearly as effective as phosphorycholine in inhibiting the self-binding complexes.\r"

Catheter-related sepsis occurred in 15% and thrombotic occlusion in 22% of those patients with Broviac catheters, compared with 3% and 1%, respectively, in patients having subcutaneous reservoirs. Although the initial cost of the subcutaneous reservoir is greater, overall cost of maintenance of the percutaneous catheter far exceeds that of the reservoir because of the need for daily catheter care and heparin flushing of the Broviac device, which is unnecessary for the subcutaneous port. Our experience favors the use of the subcutaneous reservoir in patients receiving prolonged chemotherapy.\r"

Patients' ages ranged from 24 to 90 years, with a mean age of 53 years. Multifocal disease was more common in women under age 40. Pruritus was the most common complaint, but 60% of the patients were asymptomatic. Twenty-five patients (20%) had other associated malignancies: carcinoma in situ of the cervix in ten patients, invasive carcinoma of the cervix in six, multifocal carcinoma in situ involving vulva, vagina, and cervix in five, vaginal carcinoma in situ in two, and endometrial carcinoma in two. Sixty-five patients were treated primarily with wide excision, 45 with total vulvectomy, seven with \"subtotal\" vulvectomy, three with skinning vulvectomy, and three with vulvectomy and bilateral groin node dissection; two patients refused treatment. Fifteen patients had a recurrence--recurrent carcinoma in situ in ten, and invasive carcinoma of the vulva in five. Whether the patient had had total vulvectomy or a lesser procedure appeared to make no difference in the recurrence rate. Thus a well planned excision of vulvar carcinoma in situ appears to be the treatment of choice. All recurrences were in patients over age 40, so although the lesion is histopathologically identical in the younger patients, its biologic behavior seems to be more benign. Since it is possible, however, that invasive disease will ultimately develop in some of the younger patients, careful follow-up is still required.\r"

A significant increase in spine or hip bone mineral density measured by dual photon absorptiometry was observed in all patients. The estrogen-treated group had the greatest increase in bone density. Addition of estrogen seems to supplement bone gain and allow sodium fluoride to be administered in lower doses, which are easily tolerated and yet effective.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether a therapeutic dose of iodine 131 affects the results of 24-hour radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) testing, we reviewed records of hyperthyroid patients previously treated with 131I at Michigan State University and its affiliated hospitals. We identified 26 patients who had had clinical evaluation and determination of the serum thyroxine (T4) level, triiodothyronine resin uptake (T3RU), and RAIU (using 131I) within two weeks before and several months after the therapeutic dose of 131I. Before treatment, all patients had clinical hyperthyroidism, with an elevated T4 level and increased T3RU and RAIU. After treatment with 131I, eight patients (31%) had an RAIU that was discordant with their clinical and biochemical (T4 and T3RU) assessment. In six patients (23%) of the RAIU was inappropriately high, and in two patients (8%) it was inappropriately low. Since we did not identify any other factors known to interfere with the results of RAIU testing, we conclude that a therapeutic dose of 131I, may by itself increase or decrease a subsequent RAIU determination; therefore, after treatment with 131I, RAIU is not a good diagnostic index of thyroid activity.\r"

Despite its widespread use, it is associated with relatively few complications, and these are usually minor and quickly reversible. Recently a much more dramatic and serious complication of heparin therapy has been identified. In heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with associated thrombosis or \"white clot syndrome,\" patients have paradoxic thromboembolic events while receiving heparin. These events are of acute onset and of major consequence, often resulting in limb loss or death. This paper describes our own experience with ten patients in whom the white clot syndrome occurred during heparin therapy for thrombotic or embolic events. Both porcine and bovine heparin preparations were being given through various routes. In the three cases in which platelet aggregation testing was completed, results were positive. Our ten patients ultimately had a 20% major limb amputation rate and an overall 50% mortality.\r"

This report demonstrates that the medium can be simplified further by the removal of dextrose, leaving for study a medium consisting simply of balanced salts and citrate anticoagulant (PC). Some dextrose, 3.2 mM, was present in the fresh PC platelet concentrates due to plasma carryover in the production of platelet concentrates, but this dextrose concentration was considerably less than the 22.6 to 25.5 mM present in platelet concentrates in PCD or plasma. Platelet count, pH, PCO2, and PO2, as well as platelet aggregation and release responses to stimulation, in vitro, were as well preserved in the PCD or PC media as in the plasma controls. In the PC medium, platelets consumed 2.5 mM dextrose over 5 days and left 0.7 mM dextrose. The same consumption of dextrose was noted in PCD platelet concentrates, while platelets in plasma metabolized twice as much dextrose and formed twice as much lactate. Thus, the rate of glycolysis in platelet concentrates was independent of the dextrose concentration in the medium, and the platelet functions were well preserved.\r"

A very good linear correlation (r = 0.913) was found between the initial white cell content of the PC and the histamine level at 5 days of storage. The rise in histamine content was not influenced by the type of plastic container. The results indicate a process of histamine release by the white cells during storage. Although histamine is metabolized rapidly in vivo, a critical histamine threshold could be reached in man by the rapid infusion of stored PC containing high levels of histamine. This could explain some unexpected transfusion reactions in patients receiving PC.\r"

Saline-suspended whole organisms, cell-free culture media, and disrupted organisms were used to test for such antigens in, on, and secreted by the microorganisms examined. Disrupted organisms of an isolate of Shigella sonnei nonspecifically inhibited IgG anti-Kl as well as IgG antibodies of the specificities Kpb, Fya, S, and c. However, only Escherichia coli 0125:B15, subtype 12808, had specific K1-like activity (no activity with other IgG [(k, Kpb, Jka, Fya, S, c] and IgM [A, B, M, P1] antibodies). Disrupted organisms inhibited IgM but not IgG anti-K1 in the HAI assay. A second subtype, E. coli 0125:B15, subtype 12809, exhibited no K1-like activity. These findings support the report of K1 activity in cell-free broth cultures of E. coli 0125:B15 (subtype unspecified). Thus, although not all E. coli 0125:B15 possesses K1-like activity, the finding of such activity in at least one E. coli subtype confirms the idea that bacterial components may play a role in the production of naturally occurring antibodies directed against non-ABO red cell antigens.\r"

Current methods of blood bank storage of PMN concentrates are associated with impaired in vitro PMN chemotaxis (CTX) and in vivo recovery and circulation kinetics after 24 hours of storage. This suggested the possibility that PMN may become hyperadherent during storage. To test this hypothesis, PMN concentrates were harvested and stored at both 22 and 6 degrees C and their adherence properties to relevant biologic surfaces, endothelial cell (EC) monolayers, and extracellular matrix (ECM) derived from endothelium were measured. Adherence was measured within 4 hours of collection and after 24 and 48 hours of storage. The aggregation properties of fresh and stored PMN were also studied. The adherence of fresh, unstimulated PMN to EC and ECM (31 +/- 5% and 34 +/- 4%, respectively) increased significantly after storage for 24 hours (EC = 41 +/- 8%; ECM = 43 +/- 4%) at 22 degrees C. F-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP) stimulated the adherence of fresh PMN (EC = 37 +/- 4%; ECM = 42 +/- 4%; p less than 0.05). The adherence of PMN stored at 22 degrees C was further stimulated by FMLP (EC = 46 +/- 6%; ECM = 50 +/- 4%). PMN stored at 6 degrees C had significantly higher adherence than PMN stored at 22 degrees C, and the percentage of increase in adherence induced by FMLP was attenuated in PMN stored at 6 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A method for the preparation of white-cell-poor red cells from 400 ml of blood collected in a quadruple bag with one 80-ml and two 300-ml satellite bags is described. In this procedure, a platelet concentrate was prepared from the buffy coat fraction obtained by the first centrifugation of whole blood. After centrifugation of whole blood for 5 minutes at 3500 X g, the plasma was transferred into the 300-ml bag until the interface of red cells and plasma reached a level 32 mm from the top of the bag; then approximately 70 g of plasma and buffy coat were collected into the 80-ml bag. The buffy coat fraction was centrifuged further for 5 minutes at 170 X g, and the supernatant (concentrated platelets in plasma) was transferred into the second 300-ml bag. In this blood processing, the recovery of red cells into the packed red cells and of platelets into the platelet concentrate was 93 +/- 4 percent and 52 +/- 13 percent, respectively, of the original value. White cells in the packed red cells were 70 +/- 28 X 10(7) with recovery of 32 +/- 9 percent of the original value, and the lymphocytes in the white cells were only 7 +/- 5 X 10(7) (7 +/- 4% of the original value). White cell contamination of platelet concentrate was below the threshold of white cell detection by the microcell counter (less than 300 cells per microliter of concentrate).\r"

The woman's serum reacted strongly with her husband's red cells in the antiglobulin test and with 5 of 6 Er(a-) cell samples from unrelated donors, suggesting that the antigen has an antithetical relationship to Era. The failure of the serum to react with one Er(a-) cell sample and with cells from the Er(a+) daughter of an Er(a-b+) mother gives evidence for a silent allele, Er. Four Er(b+) bloods were found among 605 random white donors, indicating a gene frequency for Erb of 0.0033.\r"

Most of the remaining donors showed a persistent p24 reactivity on Western blot and had no risk factors for HIV infection. Immunofluorescence testing of the initial sample from 93 donors could not definitively separate seroconverters from those with persistent p24 reactivity. Of 57 donors with p18 reactivity, none were positive on follow-up anti-HIV testing. Our findings suggest policies and strategies for notifying donors of atypical anti-HIV Western blot results.\r"

Although donor characteristics differed, the relative risk of a positive test for anti-HBc in the autologous group was 2.09. When 413 autologous donors were compared to 413 volunteer donors matched for age, sex, and zip code, the relative risk of a positive test for anti-HBc in the autologous group was 3.2. If anti-HBc is a marker for non-A, non-B hepatitis transmissibility, then our autologous group is not as safe as our volunteer donors. We recommend that autologous blood, even when designated by donor history and laboratory screening results as suitable for homologous transfusion, not be used for other than the intended autologous recipient.\r"

However, the risk of transfusion-transmitted diseases form such donors has not been evaluated. We compared the prevalence of infectious markers and rate of abnormal responses to a confidential donor ballot in autologous donors from two blood collection programs, one blood center and one hospital-based, to corresponding homologous blood programs. The incidence of abnormal test results in autologous donors for HIV antibodies (either Western blot confirmed or repeatedly reactive, unconfirmed), HBsAg, ALT, and anti-HBc were not statistically different from homologous rates. The incidence of STS abnormalities in autologous donors was statistically significant, although all positive results were biologic false positives. The rate of abnormal responses to the confidential ballot was statistically significant only in autologous donors whose collections were already determined to be unsuitable for homologous use due to medical history problems. Although the data do not address infectious complications in transfusion recipients, this study offers no evidence that autologous blood components are less safe than their homologous equivalents.\r"

The patients had a mean age of 39 +/- 5 years and were short-term acromegalic with a mean duration of disease of 6 +/- 3 years. Mean left ventricular mass was 163 +/- 43 g/m2 in the acromegalic group versus 120 +/- 24 g/m2 in the control group. Preload (the diastolic diameter of the left ventricle) was within normal limits, while afterload (end-systolic meridional wall stress) was significantly decreased in the acromegalic group. Myocardial contractility assessed as fractional shortening of the left ventricle was 39.9 +/- 3.6% in the acromegalic group versus 32.9 +/- 5.1% in the control group, and cardiac output was increased by 52% in the acromegalic group because of increased heart rate and stroke volume. We suggest that augmented peripheral blood flow is responsible for the condition of cardiac hyperkinesia in short-term acromegaly and involved in the development of hypertension, which is a frequent complication of long-term acromegaly.\r"

Sixteen patients also had neuroectodermal manifestations other than pheochromocytoma. Preoperatively, heart disease was found in most of the hypertensive patients aged 50 years or more at operation, but was uncommon in the others. In these subjects, heart disease persisted after surgery. Young subjects with sustained hypertension were not less affected by preoperative cerebrovascular accidents than older subjects. After surgery, hypertension persisted in 12 patients, and was easily controlled by drug therapy in eight. Nine patients died 7 months-18 years after surgery. In no case was the death directly associated with the pheochromocytoma disease. Three died from other neuroectodermal abnormalities. The 55 surviving patients have been followed up for a mean of 12 years after surgery. During the observation time the survival of the pheochromocytoma patients was similar to that of the normal population.

The intramuscular glycogen store increased by more than 80% (p less than 0.05) from 350 mumol/g dw (dry weight), and the activities of citrate synthase and 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase increased by more than 50% (p less than 0.05) and 30% (p less than 0.05). The activity of glycogen synthase was decreased by approximately 20% (p less than 0.05), whereas lactate dehydrogenase remained unchanged. Capillaries/fibre and fibre area increased by more than 50% (p less than 0.05) and 30% (p less than 0.05) leaving the area of supply constant. Training did not influence fasting blood lipids and glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, oral glucose tolerance, and insulin response to an oral glucose load measured 72 hours post-exercise. It is concluded that patients with manifest type II diabetes, as normoglycaemic individuals, adapt to physical training. However, no persistent effect on glucohomeostasis and lipaemia is produced by short-term training in the diabetic patients.\r"

Ancillary immunocytochemical studies were also performed on the smears (four cases) and cell blocks (three cases), along with ultrastructural (electron microscopic) examination of the aspirated specimen (two cases). Three of the four patients were elderly (age range: 44-65 years), and all had large pancreatic masses. A spectrum of cytomorphologic features was encountered, including poorly cohesive bizarre mononuclear cells, many multinucleated tumor giant cells, and associated malignant spindle cells. Prominent cellular cannibalism and cytophagocytosis also were seen. Immunoperoxidase studies demonstrated dual staining of the malignant cells for cytokeratin and vimentin in two cases and exclusive staining for vimentin in the remaining two cases. Ultrastructural examination demonstrated epithelial features in both cases studied. One of the cases demonstrated intracytoplasmic whorled bundles of intermediate filaments, corresponding to pale eosinophilic globular material, appreciated both in the Diff-Quik- and Papanicolaou-stained smears and staining with positive results for vimentin. The immunocytochemical studies suggest that the coexpression of vimentin and cytokeratin within the cells is consistent with a pleomorphic malignancy of epithelial origin. It is speculated that the staining of two of the cases exclusively for vimentin can be seen in either epithelial malignancies with sarcomatoid transformation or, less likely, a pure sarcoma of the pancreas.\r"

Six of them were from the small intestines and the remainder from the stomach. Their size ranged from 0.2 to 12.0 cm in maximum cross-section. The polyps were classified into four groups, based on histology and size. The nodular stage (average: 0.4 cm) showed nodules of immature fibroblasts with a loose myxoid background resembling a tactile corpuscle of Meissner. The fibrovascular stage (average: 1.5 cm) demonstrated concentric aggregations of mature fibroblasts, with endothelial proliferation and eosinophilic infiltration. When the polyps became larger (average: 4.8 cm), the histologic patterns were modified, evolving into the sclerotic or edematous stage by either collagenization or vascular compromise following intestinal obstruction. This study suggests that histologic patterns of IFPs may represent an evolutional change when size is increased.\r"

A continuous pattern of IgA deposition along the perisinusoidal area was observed not only in the alcoholic patients but also in the nonalcoholic patients. Ultrastructurally, IgA deposits were seen on the plasma membranes of Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes and in the endocytotic vesicles and phagosomes of Kupffer cells and endothelial cells. In the alcoholic group, deposits of IgA on collagen fibers were observed at sites where pericellular fibrosis developed but, on the other hand, IgA deposits were diminished or absent on the plasma membranes of hepatocytes. IgA1 showed the same deposit pattern as IgA. IgA2 was observed on and in Kupffer cells and endothelial cells but was not detected on the plasma membranes of hepatocytes. From these studies, the authors conclude that IgA deposition in the liver is not specific for alcoholic liver disease but may reflect the reduced metabolism of damaged liver. An additional finding was that, of the IgA subclasses, only IgA1 combined with the plasma membranes of hepatocytes.\r"

The low content of the enzyme in the liver of type II citrullinemic patients is associated with two kinds of the enzyme distribution that can be visualized by means of an immunohistochemical method (Saheki and colleagues. Biomed Res 1983;4:235-238). Among the 25 cases of type II citrullinemia examined, 11 exhibited homogeneous distribution of the enzyme, as in the control livers. On the other hand, 14 presented the clustered distribution, in which the hepatocytes stained positively with antisera to argininosuccinate synthetase formed a cluster among the poorly stained cells. No clustered distribution of the enzyme was present in the liver of control patients either with or without liver diseases. No clustered distribution of arginase and aldolase B was observed even in the liver of type II citrillinemic patients. These results suggest that clustered distribution is specific to argininosuccinate synthetase in the liver of type II citrullinemic patients. From considerations concerning the heterogeneous distribution of the enzyme and certain clinical parameters as well, the authors suggest that the clustered type in type II citrullinemia has a less favorable prognosis with regard to fatality.\r"

In these samples the platelet, erythrocyte, and leukocyte counts were significantly lower than in adults. Large red blood cells with a high hemoglobin content were present. Before the twentieth week of gestation, erythroblasts made up about half of the nucleated elements. Lymphocytes formed most of the leukocytes, and their absolute numbers were comparable to those in adults. Most of the fetal blood lymphocytes expressed T- or B-cell surface differentiation antigens. The percentage of T-cells was lower and that of B-cells was higher than in the adult. A high OKT4/OKT8 ratio was present. It was due to a low percentage of OKT8-positive cells. Lymphocytes with a natural killer cell phenotype were rare. Most lymphocytes were OKT10 positive, but almost none reacted with the antithymocyte antibody OKT6. These results give additional information about the development of blood cells in early human life. They can be used as reference values for the prenatal diagnosis of hereditary or acquired anomalies of the hematologic and immunologic systems.\r"

All discriminant methods identified serum albumin as the best single discriminating test, with the log-quadratic discriminant analysis classifying 81% of patients correctly. The combination of albumin, carboxy-terminal parathyroid hormone, and chloride improved classification accuracy (92% by use of log-quadratic discriminant analysis). Logistic discriminant analysis, using all 20 variables, gave a classification accuracy of 100%. Quadratic discriminant analysis gave better classification than linear discriminant analysis, and both methods performed better when log-transformed data were used. Logistic discriminant analysis followed by discrimination procedures using log-transformed data yielded the highest classification accuracy and reliability of the methods used.\r"

In three cases, tissue interpreted as diploid by one method was aneuploid by another method. The S-phase measurements were not reproducible between the methods because of the low percentage of cells in S-phase (mean: 2.6%; range: 0.0-7.5% overall). Aneuploid cells were rare in nodular goiter (2 of 19 cases, 10.5%) but were increasingly present in subsequent subgroups, i.e., 2 of 7 papillary carcinomas (28%), 3 of 10 follicular adenomas (30%), and 6 of 10 follicular carcinomas (60%).\r"

Both adenomas (11 cases) and carcinomas (6 cases) were studied. As a control for methods, ten randomly selected normal autopsy thyroids were analyzed, all of which demonstrated normal diploid DNA content. Among the Hurthle cell tumors, however, aneuploid peaks were present in six adenomas (55%) and in four carcinomas (67%). Similarly, polyploid DNA peaks in the absence of other aneuploid peaks were present in two adenomas and two carcinomas (18% and 33%, respectively). These findings demonstrate the limited value of aneuploidy or polyploidy as diagnostic features for malignancy in Hurthle cell tumors of the thyroid. As for prognosis, there does not appear to be any unfavorable prognostic significance for abnormal DNA content in histologically benign Hurthle cell tumors treated by surgical excision because no metastases or recurrences occurred in this group at a mean disease-free follow-up of 50 +/- 19 months for six aneuploid lesions and 19 +/- 7 months for two polyploid adenomas. Preliminary data suggest that aneuploidy may, however, have an important prognostic value for histologically defined Hurthle cell carcinomas, because the only patient to die from the tumor in this series had an aneuploid Hurthle carcinoma. Thus, the authors' data indicate that the diagnostic utility of DNA content in Hurthle cell tumors is extremely limited and that there does not appear to be any negative prognostic significance for aneuploidy in histologically defined Hurthle cell adenomas.\r"

Because TCAs are highly tissue bound, it has been postulated that postmortem tissue release would give rise to elevated blood levels. This study examines the authors' experience with TCAs as a cause of death and the reliability of postmortem liver and blood levels. Postmortem liver and blood TCA levels (parent drug and active metabolite) were quantitated by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). From 1977 through 1985 the number and percentage of deaths caused by TCA overdoses have remained constant in regard to the total number of deaths caused by poisonings and overdoses: range: 4-17; 5.6-20.2%, respectively. During a six-month period in 1986-1987, nine deaths were caused by six different TCAs. Substantial increases in blood TCA levels were observed as the postmortem interval increased. The mean liver and blood levels were as follows: 232 micrograms/g of tissue (SD, 168) and 6.2 mg/L (SD, 2.4). The liver to blood ratio for the nine cases was 37 (SD, 22):1. In comparison, in cases (n = 4) in which the causes of death were not TCA related but the patients were taking therapeutic doses of TCA, the mean liver and blood levels were 10.8 micrograms/g (SD, 6.0) and 0.26 mg/L (SD, 0.06), respectively. The liver to blood ratio of 39.2 (SD, 17.9): 1 was not different than in the overdose cases. This large tissue to blood gradient in both TCA overdose and therapeutic ingestion cases indicates that postmortem release of tissue-bound TCAs into the blood might falsely show elevated postmortem blood levels that could be indicative of a manner of death even in the nonoverdose, therapeutic ingestion. Thus, only liver TCA levels should be quantitated to specify the manner of death.\r"

The range of coefficients of variation (CVs) for the analyzers with NTs was as follows: Reflotron: CV, 2.4-7.9%; Seralyzer CV, 1.4-18.7%; Vision: CV, 1.5-2.7%; DT60: CV, 2.5-46.8. The percentage results that is different by greater than 10% between the NTs and trained technologists was related to the complexicity of procedure for each analyzer and was the lowest for the Vision analyzer and greatest for the Seralyzer.\r"

There have been no reports dealing with changes in thyroid function and thyroid morphologic characteristics associated with bromide intoxication. The characteristic histologic features of the affected thyroid gland included a marked hyperplasia of follicles lined by tall columnar follicular cells with foci of papillary proliferation and a loss of colloid materials in the follicular lumen. Ultrastructurally, thyroid follicular cells showed a marked dilatation of rough endoplasmic reticulum containing no electron-dense materials. X-ray microanalysis of the thyroid follicular cells revealed the presence of significant amounts of bromide and an absence of iodine. These indicated that severe hypothyroidism in this patient might be related to the accumulation of bromide in the thyroid follicular cells.\r"

The restriction of the disease to the stomach was confirmed by laparotomy and staging examinations, and the patient has been free of any malignancy during a follow-up period, of eight years. Histologically the tumor consisted of fibrous strands between which mostly small lymphocytes but also some plasma cells, eosinophils, lacunar cells, and binucleated Reed-Sternberg cells were seen. The Reed-Sternberg cells were also identified with Leu-M1 and peanut agglutinin-staining. The present case confirms that Hodgkin's disease may--although rarely--arise in the lymphatic tissue of the stomach.\r"

This case is of particular interest because a review of surgical material from a fistulotomy performed two years before the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma provides a clue to the early diagnosis. The clue is the presence of globules of mucin present in the granulation tissue and free on the slide. Fifty routine fistulotomy or fistulectomy specimens did not contain mucin globules. Recognition of the appearance of these mucin globules in fistulectomy or fistulotomy specimens can alert the pathologist to the possibility of perianal mucinous adenocarcinoma, resulting in earlier diagnosis and treatment.\r"

Previous research, however, has presented confusing and conflicting results on the determinants of childhood injuries, particularly psychosocial predictors, largely due to methodologic problems. The purpose of this analysis, based on a prospective follow-up study of 532 children, was to identify factors related to injuries encountered in a prepaid group practice during a 12-month period. Using logistic regression, we found four factors independently associated with the risk of at least one treated injury: high activity level, high rate of pediatric utilization for non-injury-related visits during the follow-up period, occurrence of a treated injury during the year preceding the follow-up period, and negative attitude toward medical care providers by the child's mother. In addition, four factors were found to be independent predictors of injuries judged severe enough to always warrant medical care: occurrence of a treated injury in the preceding year, high rate of pediatric utilization for non-injury-related visits during the follow-up period, working more than 15 hours a week outside the home by the child's mother, and more life events reported by the mother for the year preceding the follow-up period. Since family stressors are related specifically to the risk of more severe injuries, which are unlikely to escape medical attention, we conclude that these factors probably are related to the occurrence of common injuries of early childhood and not exclusively to utilization behavior. We therefore suggest that children from families with these characteristics be targeted for injury prevention strategies.\r"

Prevention of injuries that are not amenable to environmental control will require change in human behavior. Important research questions to address this goal include the following: How do identified risk factors influence the occurrence of injuries? How do children learn behaviors that alter the rate of injury? How do child developmental factors contribute to safety and injury? Innovative methods are needed, such as measure of environmental hazards, exposure to risk, and precursors of serious injuries. These approaches expanded by a broadened base of investigators should help reduce childhood mortality and morbidity due to injuries.\r"

Thirty-four children younger than 10 years of age were treated for gunshot wounds from 1980 to 1987. Sociologic and epidemiologic data were assessed by a child-abuse team and police. Other studies have concluded that gunshot wounds in young children were usually caused by unintentional injury, child abuse, or neglect. From our present study we add a further, and very disturbing, category, that of attempted or intentional pediatric homicide. The children in this category were shot in retaliation for gang activities of their older siblings. This study demonstrates that the majority of our patients' childhood gunshot wounds were related to gang violence and retaliation, the availability of handguns in the home, and child neglect. The prevalence of childhood gunshot wounds in the inner city is increasing dramatically.\r"

There were 32 unintentional deaths from firearms in children from birth to age 19 years. The death rate in rural counties was four times that of urban counties. Twenty-seven deaths (85%) occurred at home, with an adult present in only two cases. The home death rate for males was 5.2 times that of females, with 15- to 19-year-old males most at risk. The rates among whites and Native Americans were similar, at 1.5 and 1.2 per 100,000, respectively, with no deaths among the black population. This review concurs with previous studies that firearms are a significant cause of mortality in the pediatric age group. Counseling parents about the hazards of firearms may prevent deaths through better supervision and more responsible gun care and storage.\r"

The average (+/- SD) time between infant poison exposures and parent telephone calls to the statewide poison center during the evaluation period was 5 +/- 3 minutes for the subjects and 12 +/- 4 for age-matched and socioeconomically matched controls. Both groups had similar frequencies of potentially dangerous exposures for which syrup of ipecac was recommended. Subject parents appeared to have homes which in various respects were significantly more child-safe than those of the controls. Significantly more control homes contained syrup of ipecac after the exposures than before (77% vs 41%).\r"

One hundred twenty-three cases of children younger than 6 years old who ingested these products were reviewed. The cases were arbitrarily divided into three groups based on the amount ingested by history. Group 1 included children in whom less than 30 mL was ingested; group 2, 30 to 60 mL was ingested; and group 3, more than 60 to 105 mL was ingested. Of the 102 patients in group 1, no children experienced symptoms or signs. One of 17 children in group 2 was described by parents as sleepy but was asymptomatic one hour later. Two of four children in group 3 behaved as if intoxicated, yet blood ethanol levels were undetectable within 2 1/2 hours after ingestion. Based on our study, asymptomatic children who ingested by history less than 105 mL of a cologne, perfume, or after-shave and remain asymptomatic can be safely watched at home. All children with symptoms of intoxication need health care facility referral.\r"

We describe patients who were intentionally poisoned and who demonstrated these symptoms. Because of the widespread use of ipecac for therapy in acute accidental poisonings, toxicology laboratories may not look for or report the presence of this drug in their routine screens. This may delay the recognition of chronic ipecac poisoning in patients.\r"

In contrast only 25% stated they had syrup of ipecac in their home. Among blacks and Hispanics this proportion was 9%. To explore possible reasons for this we telephoned a sample of 65 physicians listed in the greater Washington, DC, telephone directory as providers of care for infants and children. Of the 45 (69%) who agreed to be interviewed, 73% informed their patients about poison control centers and 53% provided the appropriate telephone number. Although 78% believed parents should have ipecac in the house, only three (7%) of 45 actually dispensed ipecac to parents. We conclude that ipecac is not widely available in the homes of American children. By regularly dispensing it in the course of pediatric care, physicians could largely remedy this deficiency.\r"

This was a cohort study based on the injury log maintained on a daily basis by staff of the day-care center, as required by state II-censure law. A total of 224 children was enrolled in the center during the study period: 29 infants (ages 0 to 16 months), 62 toddlers (16.1 to 30 months), and 133 preschoolers (30.1 to 72 months). One hundred four children were bitten one or more times by other children in the center, with a total of 347 bites. The bite rates (defined as number of bites per 100 child days of enrollment in the center) varied significantly by age group but not by gender for initial or first-time bites, with toddlers having the highest rate and preschoolers the lowest (infants, 0.7129; toddlers, 1.3672; preschoolers, 0.4193). Total bite rates (which took into account multiple bites per child over the 12-month study period) varied significantly by age group, with toddlers having the highest rate per 100 days of enrollment and preschoolers the lowest (infants, 2.1931; toddlers, 3.1300; preschoolers, 0.5611). Males and females differed significantly in total bite rates per 100 enrollment days within the toddler age group (males, 3.6683; females, 2.3096) but not within the other two age groups. None of the demographic characteristics available in this study distinguished between children who were bitten compared with those who were not bitten with the exception of number of days of enrollment. The circumstances surrounding the biting events were examined with respect to the activity of the child when bitten, the victim's location when bitten, body part bitten, and treatment by staff. The results of this study raise policy questions about treatment protocols for human bites of children in group child-care settings, the routine recording of biting events, and the ethics and practice of reporting such events to parents.\r"

  ".W": "Alternative care arrangements are often necessary when children enrolled in day-care centers experience illness or temporary disability. To meet this need, a new facility named Health House was established by the Child Development Program of the Pomona (Calif) Unified School District. This report describes the organization, operation, and costs of the program, and reviews the management of 179 episodes of illness or temporary disability in 99 children served by the program during the 1983-1984 school year. The medical conditions of patients cared for were comparable with those seen in physicians' offices as reported in a national survey. The daily cost of care per child for the sponsoring agency was $38. The service enabled an average daily salary saving of $39.80 for the working parent. Health House may serve as a model for the management of illness or temporary disability in children enrolled in day-care centers.\r"

In 1977, Tennessee adopted the nation's first law requiring the use of child restraint devices (CRDs), but despite extensive promotional efforts, a majority of young children still travel unrestrained. We surveyed all acute-care hospitals in Tennessee to determine their policies regarding CRDs. Of 109 hospitals with obstetric services, 28 (26%) had a policy calling for discharged newborns to be transported in CRDs; only seven (5%) of 128 pediatric services had such a policy. It is time for hospitals and professional organizations to adopt policies to ensure that the parents of every child discharged from an obstetric or pediatric unit are educated concerning CRD use laws and are able to comply with them. Pediatricians should consider incorporating \"discharge in child restraint device\" into their routine discharge orders.\r"

Although labial adhesions are a relatively common lesion, they only recently have been associated with childhood sexual abuse. Labial adhesions are ordinarily found in girls between 2 months and 7 years of age and are usually very superficial and disappear spontaneously by the time the child approaches puberty. We encountered six sisters, all of whom had been sexually abused, who had labial adhesions. Four of the six had changes in the area of the posterior fourchette that were consistent with previous trauma. In addition, four of the girls' hymens had thickened, irregular edges or other changes that were considered abnormal. The father, the grandfather, and an uncle confessed to lewd and lascivious misconduct with the children. Although labial adhesions alone are not reason enough to make a report of sexual abuse, the physician is obligated to inquire as to the possible cause if the adhesions do not fit the usual pattern or if there are other suspicious findings.\r"

Children examined for sexual abuse had a mean age of 5.8 years and a median age of 5 years; 71% had normal findings on examination, including 48% of those with a history of penetration. Fourteen children were brought for evaluation on the basis of caretakers' misinterpretation, overconcern, or malice. The current spectrum of patients seen for child abuse or neglect reflects increased public and professional awareness of the problem. Earlier recognition of abuse, especially greater readiness to consider sexual abuse, brings younger, less physically injured children to the clinic.\r"

The purposes of the present study were to assess and compare residents' knowledge of child abuse and their attitudes toward the propriety of different forms of childhood discipline. We surveyed 192 residents from seven different training programs with questionnaires probing their knowledge of child abuse and their attitudes toward childhood disciplinary measures; 161 (84%) of the questionnaires were satisfactorily completed by residents in pediatrics (n = 87), family medicine (n = 51), and surgery (n = 23). Both pediatric residents and family medicine residents outperformed surgery residents in one subscale and the total score on the test. Scores were not related to year of training or attitudes toward childhood discipline but were correlated with self-reports of previous child abuse teaching. Residents' performance on a childhood disciplinary measure demonstrated wide latitude in their rating of the acceptability of 23 different modes of childhood discipline. Our findings indicate a need for a more systematic approach to residents' education in childhood intentional injuries and some value clarification of their attitudes toward various forms of childhood discipline.\r"

  ".W": "To identify which clinical findings serve to differentiate acute epiglottitis from laryngotracheitis and also to evaluate the role of direct inspection of the epiglottis in the evaluation of children initially thought to have laryngotracheitis, we prospectively evaluated 155 children presenting to the emergency room with acute stridor. Three of the findings on physical examination were associated with epiglottitis: absence of spontaneous cough, drooling, and agitation. The diagnosis assigned prior to inspection of the epiglottis was incorrect in two of six patients with epiglottitis and in three of 149 patients with laryngotracheitis. The diagnosis made after inspection was correct in all 155 patients. Minor complications of inspection were seen in seven patients with laryngotracheitis. No complications were seen in the children with epiglottitis. We conclude that drooling, agitation, and absence of cough are predictors of epiglottitis, but clinical findings alone cannot exclude epiglottitis in every child who appears to have laryngotracheitis. When laryngotracheitis is the suspected diagnosis, inspection of the epiglottis by a pediatrician in a hospital emergency room is an effective aid to the evaluation of the child with acute stridor.\r"

  ".U": "88220333\r", 
  ".W": "During maintenance hemodialysis in patients with chronic renal failure, acute elevations of the plasma calcium are common, although of doubtful significance. Because the mechanisms for this hypercalcemia are unclear, calcium, magnesium, and inorganic phosphate mass transfer data was collected during routine hemodialysis. While the increase in the plasma calcium did not significantly correlate with the gain of calcium from the dialysate nor with the dialysate calcium concentration, there was a significant positive correlation between the degree of hypercalcemia and the loss of body phosphate (r = 0.66, P less than 0.05, n = 15). Hemodialysis without ultrafiltration and concomitant hemoconcentration depressed the dialysis hypercalcemia by 46% (P less than 0.001). However, continuous infusion of 33.5 mmol of phosphate during a 5-hour dialysis period, which reduced the plasma phosphate fall (1.53 +/- 0.16 to 0.87 +/- 0.08 mmol/L, P less than 0.01, in the control group; compared with 1.59 +/- 0.19 to 1.35 +/- 0.11 mmol/L, not significant [NS], in the phosphate infusion group) abolished the hypercalcemia (2.38 +/- 0.07 to 2.54 +/- 0.04 mmol/L, P less than 0.01, in the control group and 2.39 +/- 0.06 to 2.41 +/- 0.04 mmol/L, NS, in the phosphate infusion group). It is suggested that during routine hemodialysis, the loss of inorganic phosphate from the body is excessive, and that phosphate as well as calcium is released from the intracellular pool in response to the rapid fall in the plasma phosphate concentration. Such rapid, repetitive, and excessive losses of phosphate, particularly from bone, may be an important cause of renal osteodystrophy.\r"

Increases in carboxy terminal parathyroid hormone (PTH) and urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) occurred at 1 week and persisted for up to 3 years after surgery. 1,25(OH)2D levels fell from 26.5 +/- 2.0 to 18.6 +/- 1.7 pg/mL (P less than 0.05) at 1 week. Tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP) fell from 83.4% to 72.3% at 1 month and remained at this level throughout the study. At 6 months, several changes developed that were suggestive of increased PTH effect: hypocalciuria, a decrease in serum phosphate, and the return of 1,25(OH)2D levels to baseline or above. 1,25(OH)2D levels showed an inverse correlation with serum phosphate at 6 months (r = 0.75, P less than 0.005) and 1 year (r = 0.60, P less than 0.01). In addition, at 6 months, an increase in bone mineral content by forearm photon absorptiometry was indirect evidence for a period of positive calcium balance. The compensatory changes demonstrated in this study after loss of renal mass took place over the course of several months and persisted for up to 3 years.\r"

In a boy, chronic postinfectious glomerulonephritis developed, most probably due to recurring superinfections of bullous skin lesions. He also experienced acute oliguric renal failure due to severe diarrhea during exacerbation of EBDH. A female patient developed a nephrotic syndrome due to secondary amyloidosis. Hypoalbuminemia caused further fluid losses through bullous skin lesions, aggravating intravascular hypovolemia and leading to rapid renal failure secondary to bilateral renal vein thrombosis.

We excluded from the analysis most cases in which mosaicism was diagnosed or in which there were cytogenetic discrepancies among samples obtained from the conceptus. There remain 48 cases of 47,+21, 39 cases of other nonlethal abnormalities, and 12 lethal abnormalities diagnosed in 4,481 studied. A regression analysis (restricted to the 3,848 cases diagnosed in the 35-49-year maternal age interval) was done on rates of (1) 47,+21, (2) other abnormalities excluding lethals or (3) including them, and (4) all abnormalities excluding lethals or (5) including them. The model used was y = exp(bx + c), where y is the rate of abnormality, x is maternal age at time of CVS (the modal age of the procedure was 10 gestational weeks from the last menstrual period), and b and c were, respectively, (1) 0.288 and -15.527; (2) 0.272 and -15.173; (3) 0.253 and -14.141; (4) 0.282 and -14.753; and (5) 0.271 and -14.195. We also derived rates of abnormalities at the time of CVS that would be predicted from rates (of nonmosaics) at amniocentesis after adjustment for the difference in gestational age between the usual times that these two procedures are done. The difference between the numbers of abnormalities predicted on the basis of these adjusted amniocentesis rates and the numbers observed at CVS provides an estimate of the spontaneous loss of embryos and fetuses between the usual gestational ages of these procedures. In these data, for 47,+21 the estimated proportion lost is 21% but the result is not significant at the .05 level. For other abnormalities excluding lethals the estimated spontaneous loss is 29% (P approximately .05); including lethals it is 44%. For all abnormalities, excluding lethals, pooled together, the estimate is 24%; including lethals it is 33%. The last three values are all significant at the .05 level or lower. The observed rates of abnormalities at CVS would be approximately 10% to 15% higher if one pooled diagnosed mosaics with the nonmosaics, but the estimated proportion of spontaneous fetal loss would be lower.\r"

Ascertainment correction, which has not been applied in previous studies of CF carrier fertility, was applied to these data. Before ascertainment correction was applied, CF carriers appeared to manifest a significant fertility advantage over controls. After the correction formula was applied, this difference disappeared. Carriers and controls were also compared in terms of the length of intervals between births. Again, no significant differences were found. It was concluded that fertility differences are unlikely to account for the observed Caucasian CF gene frequency. Other mechanisms, particularly a past selective event or random genetic drift, are more likely to be responsible.\r"

The calculated incidence of adnexal masses that required surgical intervention during pregnancy in our primary population (patients who were not referred for evaluation of an already identified mass) was one case per 1300 live births. A malignant tumor was found in 5.9% of the pregnant patients who underwent exploratory celiotomy for therapy of an adnexal mass. Those pregnant women who underwent emergency celiotomy because of hemorrhage or torsion as a complication of an adnexal mass spontaneously aborted or underwent premature delivery more frequently than those patients who underwent elective celiotomy for removal of the mass (p less than 0.001). On the basis of this review, we recommend that pregnant women with persistent adnexal masses undergo elective extirpation of the mass in the second trimester of pregnancy.\r"

To minimize the confounding effect of the socioeconomic status, the outcome of grand multiparity has been investigated in a mostly homogeneous, ultraorthodox Jewish community in Jerusalem, Israel. A total of 5916 deliveries in one community hospital (Bikur Cholim) were studied, of which 893 (13%) occurred in mothers who had given birth to seven or more infants. There was a significant decrease in the incidence of small for gestational age infants among the grand multiparous women (3.6% as opposed to 5.8% in the control population). This difference was independent of maternal age. Moreover, grand multiparous women gave birth to significantly more large for gestational age infants. No increase in obstetric complications or neonatal morbidity and mortality was found among the offspring of the grand multiparous mothers. Having taken socioeconomic status into account, we conclude that grand multiparity does not carry an increased risk of perinatal morbidity or mortality.\r"

  ".U": "88220413\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously reported the detection of endotoxin in the amniotic fluid of patients with gram-negative intraamniotic infection. Endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide is a potent biologic product capable of inducing prostaglandin release from several cell types and, therefore, may be involved in the onset of human parturition in the presence of intraamniotic infection. This article describes a technique for the quantification of endotoxin in amniotic fluid. The method uses a computer-assisted quantification of the turbidimetric reaction between the Limulus amebocyte lysate and endotoxin. Serial dilutions of Escherichia coli endotoxin in culture-negative amniotic fluid were prepared, and the samples were run in the assay. Amniotic fluid was found to enhance the reaction, and a dilution of 1:20 was required for this biologic fluid to behave similarly to pyrogen-free water. The sensitivity of this kinetic turbidimetric technique in the detection of endotoxin in amniotic fluid was 40 pg/ml. This method was applied to the quantification of endotoxin concentration in amniotic fluid in 26 patients with intraamniotic infection and premature rupture of membranes. Patients in active labor had higher concentrations of endotoxin (median = 47,514 pg/ml) than nonlaboring patients (median = 635 pg/ml) (p less than 0.025). Therefore, women with preterm labor had a higher median concentration of endotoxin in amniotic fluid than patients who were not in labor.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective ultrasound evaluation of 150 normal pregnant women was conducted between 15 and 40 weeks' gestation. A variety of biometric measurements were obtained that included measurements of the frontal lobe distance (the anterior edge of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles to the frontal bone) and the thalamic frontal lobe distance (measured from the posterior edge of the thalami to the frontal bone). Analysis of these data revealed a high degree of correlation between the gestational age and the frontal lobe distance (R2 = 0.89, p less than 0.0001), and between the gestational age and thalamic frontal lobe distance (R2 = 0.93, p less than 0.0001). Similarly, a high degree of correlation was also found between the biparietal diameter and the frontal lobe distance (R2 = 0.95; p less than 0.0001), between the biparietal diameter and the thalamic frontal lobe distance (R2 = 0.90, p less than 0.0001), and between the frontal lobe distance and the thalamic frontal lobe distance (R2 = 0.92, p less than 0.0001). The relationships between femur length and frontal lobe distance (R2 = 0.89, p less than 0.0001) and between the femur length and the thalamic frontal lobe distance (R2 = 0.945, p less than 0.0001) were also evaluated. Nomograms for the relationships between gestational age and frontal lobe distance and thalamic frontal lobe distance were generated and included the mean +/- SD and the percentile distributions. Growth of the frontal lobe was best described by a first-degree linear equation. The results of this study demonstrate the pattern of growth of the frontal lobe and the high rate of correlation between growth of the frontal lobe and the gestational age and the biparietal diameter. These findings offer a potential method by which the decreasing size of the frontal lobe, as shown in three cases described herein, can be evaluated prenatally and thus serve as a useful tool in the prenatal diagnosis of microcephaly.\r"

A total of 844 blood samples from patients with ovarian cancer and gynecologic control subjects was evaluated to determine the specificity of each of the four assays for ovarian cancer. It was determined that the mean and percent positivity for patients with ovarian cancer were significantly higher than those values for all control groups. When clinical parameters of the patients with ovarian cancer were examined, it was found that NB/70K appeared to be elevated in patients with all of the pathologic types of early stage, low-grade epithelial ovarian cancers studied. One of the four radioimmunoassays (the NB12123 assay) was capable of detecting elevated blood NB/70K levels in greater than 50% of patients with early stage ovarian malignancies. The NB12123 assay was also able to detect NB/70K in the blood of 45% (9 of 20) of patients with stage I, well-differentiated ovarian cancer. These results indicate that NB/70K may be a useful marker for the early detection of localized tumors as well as for monitoring patients with ovarian cancer, as has been demonstrated previously. In addition, NB/70K appears to be a marker for all stages, grades, and pathologic types of human ovarian epithelial tumors.\r"

A study of possible predisposing factors was conducted in 398 and 383 primiparas admitted for uncomplicated spontaneous labor at two hospitals. Psychosocial factors, notably anxiety about childbirth, and physical factors, especially maternal height and body mass index, were measured before the onset of labor. Difficult labor was defined in primiparas admitted to the hospital for spontaneous uncomplicated labor as (1) prolonged labor that was longer than 15 hours from admission until full dilation with vaginal delivery or (2) cesarean section. Anxiety about childbirth as self-reported before the onset of labor did not predispose to difficult labor at either hospital. Short height and heavy body mass index predisposed to difficult labor. Further work is needed to elucidate psychosocial factors predisposing to difficult labor.\r"

Although the safety of vaginal birth after cesarean section has been documented in several recent publications, automatic repeat cesarean section remains the rule in this country. We present one of the largest series of trial of labor ever reported. Of 57,553 live births, 4929 (8.6%) were of women with prior cesarean sections. Among 1776 patients who underwent a trial of labor, 1314 (74%) delivered vaginally. There was no maternal or perinatal mortality related to uterine scar rupture. Thus during the study period 1314 major operations were avoided. We conclude that, for the vast majority of women, allowing a trial of labor is a safe alternative to automatic elective repeat cesarean section.\r"

Induction of progestin receptors did not occur in one case of uterine mixed mullerian tumor and there were no measured progestin receptors after tamoxifen treatment in three cases of ovarian cancer and in one case of benign ovarian tumor. Because induction of progestin receptors is the best-documented response of estrogen target cells to estrogenic stimuli, this induction of progestin receptor with tamoxifen may be considered to indicate the estrogen sensitivity of a tumor. Further study is warranted to determine whether hormonal sensitivity assessed by the use of tamoxifen might serve to select tumors likely to respond to hormonal therapy.\r"

Only four (12%) patients with significant intrinsic renal disease did not have effective normalization of renal function by percutaneous nephrostomy. Percutaneous nephrostomies allow rapid and reliable urinary diversion without the morbidity and mortality of operative techniques. Percutaneous nephrostomy should be considered for relief of ureteral obstruction in patients with untreated cervical carcinoma who may enjoy prolonged palliation or cure, in patients with complications of previous urinary conduits as a temporizing method of urinary diversion, and in patients with benign or chemotherapy-sensitive pelvic malignancies causing ureteral obstruction.

There were no apparent differences in abortion management between those women readily conceiving and those in whom there was some delay, although termination because of chromosomal reasons or anatomic abnormalities was less commonly followed by another pregnancy as compared with those terminated for rubella or other viral infections. Reduced fertility after a late prostaglandin-induced abortion thus appears to be very infrequent.\r"

The mean circulating concentration of 7B2 immunoreactive equivalents was found to be significantly increased throughout pregnancy (10 to 12 weeks, 52.2 +/- 13.1 pmol/L; 20 to 22 weeks, 74.4 +/- 20.1 pmol/L; 30 to 32 weeks, 56.0 +/- 12.9 pmol/L; and 36 to 40 weeks, 85.7 +/- 13.6 pmol/L) when compared with a group of 32 age-matched nonpregnant controls (19.7 +/- 5.0 pmol/L); (p less than 0.01). The highest 7B2 plasma concentrations were found shortly before delivery (36 to 40 weeks) and fell sharply after birth, returning to normal within 4 to 6 weeks. Fetal plasma from both umbilical artery and vein was found to have particularly high concentrations of 7B2-like immunoreactivity (396 +/- 19 and 361 +/- 24 pmol/L, respectively), and 7B2 was extractable from the placenta. Chromatographic analysis of plasma and tissue extracts showed the main peak of immunoreactivity to coincide with that originally described in the pituitary gland. Although the function of 7B2 is at present unknown, our data suggest that 7B2 immunoreactivity in fetal blood originates from the fetus and may play an important role in pregnancy.\r"

Amniotic fluid volumes were measured by ultrasound examination, and the distribution volume of inulin in the neonate was assumed to be 180 ml/kg on the basis of animal experiments. The mean permeability was 0.15 microliter/(s.g) placenta. This value and the previously measured permeability for cyanocobalamin delimit a range of molecular weights from 1350 to 5200 daltons. In this range permeability to lipid-insoluble molecules is roughly proportional to the coefficients of free diffusion in water without further discrimination of molecular size by the placental barrier.\r"

Of these, 24 patients had a significant decrease in abdominal pressure transmission to the urethra once the cystocele was reduced by vaginal pessary (abdominal pressure transmission ratio to urethra: bladder of less than 1.0). All 24 had a revised Pereyra procedure in addition to the cystocele repair. The other 43 patients had adequate abdominal pressure transmission to the urethra once the cystocele was reduced by vaginal pessary (abdominal pressure transmission ratio to urethra: bladder of greater than or equal to 1.0). These 43 patients underwent cystocele repair only with no surgical repair to the urethra or urethrovesical junction. Evaluation was repeated at 3 to 6 months after the operation. No patient developed urinary incontinence after operation. All 67 patients had urodynamically good abdominal pressure transmission to the urethra while coughing. Women with significant genitourinary prolapse may be continent in spite of a weak urethral sphincter because of kinking of the poorly supported urethra. Urodynamic testing can identify those women at risk of developing postoperative urinary incontinence so that prophylactic measures can be undertaken.\r"

To ensure the appropriateness of collection of umbilical artery and venous blood samples, progesterone content was also determined. Although there is no significant difference in maternal vein content of catechol estrogens between the two groups, the umbilical venous (p = 0.03) and arterial (p = 0.002) plasma concentrations are significantly higher at vaginal delivery than those measured at abdominal delivery. In view of the present data and the importance of catechol estrogens in prostaglandin synthesis and in potentiating the activity of catecholamines through competitive inhibition of catechol-O-methyltransferase, it is suggested that catechol estrogens may play a role in triggering the events involved in the onset of labor and delivery in humans.\r"

To characterize this response more fully, the effects of human follicular fluid on a continuous line of bovine aortic arch endothelial cells were studied. Human follicular fluid showed strong mitogenic activity toward endothelial cells, ranging from a threefold increase in thymidine incorporation at a dilution of 1:10 to a 1.4-fold increase at a dilution of 1:3200. Endothelial cells also exhibited a directional migration (chemotaxis) toward human follicular fluid. A 1:10 dilution of human follicular fluid induced a 6.8-fold increase in directional cellular migration through membranes with 8 microns pores, and a 1:800 dilution induced a 1.8-fold increase in migration. Endothelial cells responding to gradients of human follicular fluid also demonstrated a marked change in morphologic structure when compared with control cells. Human plasma and fibrinogen were angiogenic and chemotactic (but not mitogenic) toward endothelial cells, which suggested that fibrinogen may account for at least part of the angiogenic activity of human follicular fluid. These results indicate that human follicular fluid is strongly angiogenic and that this biologic activity can be associated with effects directly on endothelial cells in vitro.\r"

To establish the correlation of M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography with direct invasive methods, the size and volume of the heart of 10 fetal lambs were determined. Both M-mode echocardiography as well as the two-dimensional method were found to correlate well with direct measurements. As determined by all three modalities, the right ventricular cavity was found to be larger than the left ventricular cavity. Intraventricular septum thickness was best measured by the two-dimensional technique, whereas posterior wall dimensions were difficult to assess by this technique. This is the first study that attempts to validate echocardiography as it pertains to the fetus. It shows that a good correlation between invasive and noninvasive methodology can be obtained. Encouraging findings may lead other investigators to use such techniques in the human fetus to quantify ventricular size and output under normal and abnormal conditions.\r"

An initial subpressor dose of norepinephrine (1.54 +/- 0.18 nmol/kg.min) (+/- SEM) was given, followed by a pressor dose (4.57 +/- 0.59 nmol/kg.min) that caused a 14% increase in mean arterial blood pressure. Placental blood flow as measured by the microsphere technique decreased by 24% in 11 placentas with normal-sized fetuses during the subpressor dose and by 46% during the pressor dose. In 11 placentas with growth-retarded fetuses the two norepinephrine doses reduced blood flow by 19% and 43%, respectively. These results indicate that there is no difference in adrenergic responsiveness between the vessels supplying the placenta of a normal-sized fetus and the arteries of the placenta of a growth-retarded guinea pig. It is suggested that an increase in circulating maternal catecholamine levels would affect a growth-retarded fetus more severely than the normal-sized fetus because the growth-retarded fetus even during normal conditions exists at, or even beyond, the border of imminent asphyxia and hypoglycemia.\r"

Possible mechanisms responsible for this effect include retinal processing, diffraction effects, and spherical aberration. By employing geometric blur circle theory and using a simple optical model to photograph the effect, we concluded that monocular diplopia in the setting of ordinary refractive error is secondary to relatively minor optical irregularity such as spherical aberration. Contour enhancement properties of the retina probably accentuate this effect. Ordinary refractive error should therefore not be overlooked or discounted in patients with monocular diplopia.\r"

Traction detachment of the macula was the most frequent reason for surgery (15 of 22 eyes), followed by nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage (seven of 22 eyes). Vessels found in the membranes were studied by serial sectioning and categorized as having either developing, mature, or regressing characteristics. Developing vessels were seen in ten of 23 membranes (43%), mature vessels in 19 of 23 membranes (83%), and regressing vessels in 13 of 23 membranes (57%). Endothelial fenestrations and cell separations were rare. With three-dimensional reconstruction, we found that new vessels often extended cytoplasmic processes into the extracellular matrix and that lumina were present even at the distalmost tips of the vessels. Solid cords of endothelial cells were not seen. We concluded that in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, new vessels develop by a process of focal extracellular matrix degradation, generalized and exuberant extracellular matrix production, cytoplasmic microvillus extension into the extracellular matrix, and active lumen formation.\r"

The number of tumor cells in tracts of direct transscleral aspirates was compared to those in tracts of indirect aspirates that traversed the anterior chamber or vitreous. Cellular material obtained with 30-gauge needles was sufficient for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma in all but one case. While 14 of 21 (67%) of all fine needle aspiration tracts and eight of 15 (53%) of indirect tracts contained tumor cells, the number of tumor cells was less than that associated with tumor growth in experimental models. Indirect aspirate tracts contained significantly fewer cells than tracts of direct aspirates (P less than .001).\r"

These models generate falsifiable predictions about the pattern of risk in relatives of affected individuals. For example, all such models predict a substantially higher risk of illness in siblings than in offspring of affected individuals. It is now possible to develop and test rigorous models for the cultural transmission of psychiatric illness.\r"

Multivariate regression techniques were used to test for gender differences across multiple outcomes. The women experienced fewer rehospitalizations and shorter stays than did the men. These findings were not an artifact of diagnosis. The results suggest that the determinants of gender differences occur during the premorbid period and are manifest early in the development of the disorder.\r"

Preliminary assessment of test performance measures (sensitivity, specificity, and predictive power) showed that use of the dexamethasone suppression index was an improvement over the use of cortisol levels alone. Factoring dexamethasone levels into post-dexamethasone cortisol level measures may enhance the utility of neuroendocrine assessment in psychiatry.\r"

Approximately 58 cases were admitted per year. Mean length of hospital stay was 11.8 days, 75 per cent of patients received intensive care, and estimated annual hospital charges were $438,828 (1986 dollars). Cases had severe hypertension on admission (mean systolic blood pressure, 229.8 mmHg; mean diastolic blood pressure, 143 mmHg). Two-thirds had clinical evidence of acute arteriolitis. Cases were predominantly young, male, Black or Hispanic, and of lower socioeconomic status. At least 93 per cent of cases were previously diagnosed, and at least 83 per cent were aware of their diagnosis of hypertension. Improved management of chronic hypertension rather than more intensive screening may be a useful strategy to reduce the incidence of hypertensive emergency.\r"

We find general approval for organ procurement but serious hesitation about dealing with donor families, particularly among physicians. Physician support for donation, moreover, is the strongest predictor of other professionals, attitudes toward donation.

The 477 Case Summaries filed between December 1981 and June 1985 were analyzed to provide a more systematic account of how the judicial consent statute is applied in the courtroom. After hearings which typically lasted 12 minutes, only nine minors were judged immature. No evidence for a discernible pattern justifying these rulings emerged from an examination of petitioner and court characteristics such as age, length of hearing, number of weeks pregnant, or presiding judge. Further, 11 lawyers privately reported they found their clients immature. In only one instance, however, did the lawyer and judge identify the same adolescent. The findings add to a growing body or research that calls into question the ability of the consent statute to protect the best interest of the minors involved.\r"

Regardless of ownership, the great majority of parents (82 per cent) acquired a free smoke detector, but those previously without a smoke detector were more likely to do so. These characteristics of smoke detector usage and acquisition should be considered in targeting future intervention strategies.\r"

Cases with limb reduction defects (N = 237) and randomly selected controls (N = 475) were compared regarding parental occupation and maternal county of residence. After adjustment for potential confounders in a multivariate analysis, the estimated relative risk (RR) of parenting a child with a limb reduction defect among parents involved in agricultural work was 0.9 (95 per cent confidence limits = 0.4, 1.7). The RR among mothers who resided in a county of high agricultural productivity as compared with minimal agricultural productivity was 1.7 (95% CL = 1.1, 2.7), while the RR associated with residence in a county with high pesticide use as compared with minimal pesticide use was 1.9 (95% CL = 1.2, 3.1). When we limited the cases to children with limb reduction defects who had at least one additional anomaly (n = 79) and compared them to the control births, the corresponding RRs were 1.6 (95% CL = 0.7, 3.6), for parental involvement in agricultural work, 2.4 (CL = 1.2, 4.7) for county agricultural productivity, and 3.1 (CL = 1.5, 6.5) for county pesticide use.\r"

Nine clinical cases were identified, eight of whom had Giardia positive stool specimens. All were female; seven were adults (greater than 18 years) and two were children. The attack rate was highest (39 per cent, 5/13) for the ladies lap group who had exposure on one day. These cases had no direct contact with children or other risk factors for acquiring Giardia. Infection most likely occurred following the ingestion of swimming pool water contaminated with Giardia cysts. The source of Giardia contamination was a handicapped child who had a fecal accident in the pool. He was a member of a group that swam at the same time as the ladies lap group. A stool survey of the handicapped group showed that of the 20 persons tested, nine were positive for Giardia, including the specimen from this child. Examination of the pool records showed that no chlorine levels had been taken on the day of the fecal accident and that on the following day the chlorine level was zero. This is the second report of Giardia transmission among swimming pool attendees. It emphasizes the need to maintain appropriate chlorine levels in swimming pools and to institute measures to clear pools after a fecal accident.\r"

Patients who completed treatment lost a mean of 83.9 per cent of their excess weight, but regained an average of 59 per cent to 82 per cent of their initial excess weight by 30 months following start of treatment. The combination of behavior modification and supplemented fasting regimens was a successful means of effecting weight loss. However, there appeared to be limited weight loss maintenance. Behavioral epidemiological studies are needed to identify variables responsible for maintenance of weight loss.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of interpregnancy interval on the birthweight of the subsequent child was investigated in a cohort of 5,938 women who registered for two consecutive pregnancies in the Collaborative Perinatal Project. Mean birthweight increased from 3,101 grams for intervals of less than 3 months to 3,193 grams for intervals of 15-17.9 months and remained stable thereafter (p for trend = 0.006). However, women with shorter intervals were younger, lighter weight, and less educated at the beginning of the first pregnancy than were women with longer intervals; the birthweight of their previous child was lower, and they were of marginally lower socioeconomic status. Adjustment for confounders reduced the maximum difference in mean birthweight by interval length from 92 to 39 grams, and blunted the trend for lower birthweights with shorter intervals (p = 0.45). Similarly, adjustment reduced the increased risk of low birthweight among women with the shortest intervals from 52 per cent to 12 per cent. We conclude that a short interpregnancy interval is primarily a marker for a woman who is otherwise at high risk, and that modification of this interval alone may be unlikely to have a major impact on low birthweight.\r"

We studied factors causing their decline in incidence using data collected by the Committee on Maternal Welfare of the Massachusetts Medical Society between 1954 and 1985. The dramatic decline in incidence of these conditions in the Commonwealth during the study period appears to have been due to both legislative actions and improvements in medical practice. The legislative actions included licensing of maternity services, blood banks, and legalization of abortion. Cardiac-related mortality has declined due to a reduction in the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease. Changes in clinical practice that stand out were the aggressive control of the hypertensive component of toxemia leading to a reduced incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, the prompt recourse to blood transfusion for hemorrhage, and the use of broad spectrum antibiotics.\r"

After 12 years of follow-up, results indicate that increased levels of physical activity reported at study entry were inversely related to the risk of definite coronary heart disease in both age groups. In particular, among those aged 45 to 64 years, the rate of definite coronary heart disease in men who led active life styles was 30 per cent lower than the rate experienced by those who were less active (relative risk, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.53, 0.88). In those older than 64 years, the rate of definite coronary heart disease in active men was less than half the rate experienced by those who led more sedentary life styles (relative risk, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.19, 0.99). These results continued to hold up when controlling for several cardiovascular risk factors and potentially confounding variables, supporting earlier observations that physical activity is beneficial in middle-age, and further suggesting that benefits may extend to the elderly male population as well.\r"

  ".W": "Over the past decade worker-controlled occupational health centers have been established in three Canadian provinces. This development has been a response to the slowness in recognizing occupational medicine in the Canadian medical community, the limited availability and questionable acceptability of existing services, as well as the growth of worker control in occupational health matters generally. The history, funding, organizational structure, personnel, resources, and programs of these worker-controlled centers are outlined, illustrating the extensive programs that can be provided despite small budgets of these operations. Advantages to workers include direct access to resources as well as expert professional advice with the focus on work place hazards. Furthermore, the centers provide for extensive interaction among workers on their common concerns. Disadvantages of the model include restricted access to work places associated with frequent distrust of employers. Employer-based and university-based models are compared to worker-controlled centers, and it is suggested that the latter may influence the pattern of practice of occupational health as well as the ability of workers and their unions to promote improved occupational health and safety conditions.\r"

No satisfactory biliary replacement material has yet been found. In the experimental model of bile duct stricture that has been presented, human amnion bile duct injuries mimicking those seen in clinical practice were repaired using human amnion as a free graft. Noncircumferential duct loss appeared to be satisfactorily repaired using amnion, and the amnion repair was found to be as good as or superior to plastic repair; however, circumferential duct loss was not adequately repaired with the amnion graft.\r"
