We studied 8 patients with either neuromyelitis optica (6), acute myelopathy (1), or acute optic neuropathy (1) in close temporal association with pulmonary tuberculosis, but with no evidence for CNS tuberculosis. Neurologic symptoms preceded the use of antituberculosis medication in 5 patients. Different patients showed similar clinical features, suggesting a consistent disease pattern. Autopsy examination (1 patient) revealed extensive spinal cord and optic nerve demyelination. We identified only 5 additional patients seen over the same period with idiopathic neuromyelitis optica, thus suggesting that the close temporal relationship to pulmonary tuberculosis is not coincidental. The syndrome is most likely due to an immune reaction to tuberculosis rather than the use of antituberculosis medication.\r"

  ".W": "Two human retroviruses, HIV-1 and HTLV-I, have been associated with myelopathies in addition to other neurologic disorders. We report an American dually infected with HIV-1 and HTLV-I who developed steroid-responsive myeloneuropathy. This 28-year-old bisexual man developed interstitial pneumonitis and a transient midthoracic sensory level followed by the evolution of a slowly progressive spastic paraparesis and sensorimotor neuropathy. Serologic studies demonstrated coinfection with both HIV-1 and HTLV-I. Peripheral blood absolute CD4 count was persistently within the normal range. Cranial MRI was normal and spinal MRI showed T3-T10 atrophy. Serial CSF analyses demonstrated marked intrathecal synthesis of anti-HTLV-I IgG, lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein and immunoglobulin G, and oligoclonal bands. HIV-1 was isolated from CSF but not from peripheral nerve. Lymphoproliferative studies confirmed spontaneous proliferation in both blood and CSF. Soluble interleukin 2 receptor and soluble CD8 were greatly elevated in blood and CSF when compared with patients with HIV-related vacuolar myelopathy and seronegative patients with other causes of myelopathy. Nerve biopsy showed epi- and endoneurial CD8+ lymphocytic infiltration without vasculitis; muscle biopsy showed features of acute and chronic denervation. A 6-week course of prednisone produced sustained improvement in leg strength and walking times. We speculate that the myeloneuropathy was caused by HTLV-I in the setting of coinfection with HIV-1.\r"

In 2 patients, PML was associated with severe HIV encephalitis. In those 2 cases, the areas of extensive JC-induced demyelination were massively infiltrated by HIV infected macrophages/microglial cells with evidence for localized increase of HIV encephalitis in PML lesions. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we demonstrated that each virus infects, in a latent or productive fashion, different CNS cell populations. Therefore, the extension of HIV encephalitis could not be related to an intracellular transactivation of 1 virus by the other. However, the results are consistent with dissemination of viral infection by the recruitment of HIV-infected macrophages to damaged areas of the brain. This phenomenon might be generalized to other pathogens that are frequently associated with HIV CNS infection. Early detection and treatment of opportunistic CNS lesions could be important to prevent extension of HIV encephalitis.\r"

In 2 of these patients, the neuropathy progressed to generalized flaccid paralysis with bulbar and respiratory involvement, requiring endotracheal intubation and ICU monitoring. EMG and nerve conduction studies showed evidence of conduction block, suggestive of a demyelinating polyneuropathy. After several weeks, both patients improved clinically. The other 2 patients developed a reversible neuropathy with flaccid paresis of the limbs but without bulbar or respiratory compromise. No immediate response to plasmapheresis was noted. All 4 patients demonstrated an elevated CSF protein in the acute phase of their neuropathy, which declined or returned to normal during recovery. The development of polyneuropathy correlated with the maximum plasma suramin level, with an estimated 40% risk of developing neurotoxicity in those patients whose maximum level was 350 micrograms/ml or greater. No correlation could be made with the total dose of suramin administered or with the duration of therapy. Two of these 4 patients manifested tumor shrinkage while receiving suramin therapy. We conclude that suramin, a promising antineoplastic agent, is capable of inducing a severe sensorimotor polyneuropathy which appears to be related to the plasma concentration of suramin. Serial measurement of the plasma concentration during suramin therapy is recommended.\r"

During that time, the EEG showed a typical encephalopathic pattern. Comprehensive evaluation ruled out the possibility of metabolic, toxic, drug-related, or ongoing nonconvulsive status epilepticus. We have designated this syndrome as prolonged postictal encephalopathy (PPIE). Nine of 11 patients were mildly to borderline mentally retarded. Ten had previous episodes of status epilepticus. Nine of 11 had minimal structural abnormalities (mainly diffuse cortical atrophy). Nine patients had multiple recurrent episodes of PPIE. All episodes occurred following a cluster of seizures: in 8 patients after a cluster of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, in 2 after complex partial seizures, and in 1 patient after a cluster of atypical absence seizures. This series suggests that vulnerability to develop PPIE exists in patients with diffuse structural abnormalities, mild to borderline mental retardation, a history of status epilepticus, and a tendency of seizures to cluster.\r"

The area in which language interference could be produced began from at least 11 to 35 mm posterior to the temporal tip and ended at least 39 to 74 mm posterior to the temporal tip. The most consistently impaired language tasks were spontaneous speech and passage reading, but there was impairment of all language functions tested in some patients.

Lorazepam entered the bloodstream rapidly following intraperitoneal injection. Brain concentrations peaked 10 minutes after peak serum levels were achieved. Lorazepam remained in brain longer than in serum, leading to increasing brain: serum ratios over time once peak serum levels had been reached. Free lorazepam was 9.1% of the total concentration in serum, a fraction similar to that which has been reported for humans. The median effective dose for control of generalized tonic-clonic seizures in this model was 0.94 mg/kg, which would produce a serum concentration of 196 ng/ml. Rats in SE had higher serum lorazepam concentrations than controls given the same doses, but lower brain: serum ratios, perhaps due to lactic acidosis during SE. Our data confirmed clinical reports of lorazepam's effectiveness as a treatment for SE and suggest that a target serum concentration of 200 ng/ml should be effective in most cases and provide seizure protection for 24 hours following treatment.\r"

The excimer laser has been attracting researchers' interest in the new application of laser to cornea and lens. The erbium:YAG laser emits a 2.94-microns beam that can ablate the transparent ocular tissues such as lenses and corneas. The author has applied this laser to the cornea, lens, vitreous and other ocular tissues. The erbium:YAG laser beam was directed through a 1.5-meter-long, 200-microns-diameter fiberoptic guide. The radiant energy measured about 50 mJ at the end of the probe. The laser was emitted as a 400-microsecond pulse. Freshly enucleated rabbit eyes were used in this study. Laser burns were applied to the tissue surface at various energy settings. At minimal power, the tissues were coagulated by the erbium:YAG laser application. At a power of more than 636-954 mJ/mm2, tissue began to evaporate; the tissue loss was observed under a surgical light microscope. Corneal photoablation, lens ablation, iridotomy, trabeculotomy, cutting of the vitreous and retinal ablation were easily performed. Like the excimer laser, the erbium:YAG laser is a potential tool for ocular surgery.\r"

Our results show that focal photocoagulation (CLV) generally depressed sensitivity (increased MD) in the treated central 10 degrees field, whereas in the untreated control region (10-30 degrees) sensitivity generally remained stable. However, the whole-field indices indicated that overall the fields remained stable following focal photocoagulation treatment.

At electron microscopy it is possible to identify: (1) receptors still possessing their architecture and nerve component but with modified nerve ending features and relationship with the Schwann cell covering; (2) receptors maintaining their general architecture but completely lacking the nerve component; (3) receptors where also the general architecture is completely disorganized. All these alterations seem to indicate that in strabismics the reception and transmission of proprioceptive information are abnormal and support the hypothesis that a disturbance of ocular proprioception can play an important role in the pathogenesis of congenital strabismus.\r"

  ".W": "A descriptive study of the biomechanical variables of the walking patterns of the fit and healthy elderly compared with those of young adults revealed several significant differences. The walking patterns of 15 elderly subjects, selected for their active life style and screened for any gait- or balance-related pathological conditions, were analyzed. Kinematic and kinetic data for a minimum of 10 repeat walking trials were collected using a video digitizing system and a force platform. Basic kinematic analyses and an inverse dynamics model yielded data based on the following variables: temporal and cadence measures, heal and toe trajectories, joint kinematics, joint moments of force, and joint mechanical power generation and absorption. Significant differences between these elderly subjects and a database of young adults revealed the following: the same cadence but a shorter step length, an increased double-support stance period, decreased push-off power, a more flat-footed landing, and a reduction in their \"index of dynamic balance.\" All of these differences, except reduction in index of dynamic balance, indicate adaptation by the elderly toward a safer, more stable gait pattern. The reduction in index of dynamic balance suggests deterioration in the efficiency of the balance control system during gait. Because of these significant differences attributable to age alone, it is apparent that a separate gait database is needed in order to pinpoint falling disorders of the elderly.\r"

Balance was tested using the sharpened Romberg test (SR) and the one-legged stance test (OLST) on each foot with eyes open and eyes closed. A strain-gauge-based quantitative muscle tester (QMT) was used to measure force production. All torque values were normalized as a percentage of body weight. A self-report of activity level also was recorded. The results indicated that OLST scores and normalized torques of the hip flexors, extensors, and abductors had a positive correlation and that SR scores and normalized torques of the hip extensors and right hip abductors had a positive correlation. Subjects who considered themselves to be very active had a significantly higher SR eyes-closed balance time as compared with those who rated themselves as less active. Subjects who considered themselves to be very active also had significantly higher normalized torque values for most muscle groups tested. Negative relationships were shown between age and balance time and between age and force production.\r"

Forty-two ulcerated feet were examined in 40 patients. All patients had severely decreased or absent sensation. Foot deformities were classified according to operational definitions as 1) Charcot's foot, 2) a compensated forefoot varus, or 3) an uncompensated forefoot varus or forefoot valgus. The plantar surface of the midfoot and forefoot was divided into three regions. Six of the 7 patients with a Charcot's foot showed ulceration at the midfoot. Nine of 18 patients with a compensated forefoot varus showed ulceration at the second, third, or fourth metatarsal head. Fifteen of 17 patients with an uncompensated forefoot varus or forefoot valgus showed ulceration at the first or fifth metatarsal. A significant relationship was found between foot deformity and location of ulcer. These results support the hypotheses 1) that insensitivity, coupled with increased, repetitive pressure, is a primary cause of plantar ulcers and 2) that certain foot types are associated with characteristic patterns of pressure distribution and callus formation.\r"

The subjects performed progressive exercise tests on each apparatus on entry into a residential transitional rehabilitation program and approximately 3 months later following participation in a physical conditioning program. On both the initial and 3-month exercise tests, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) was significantly greater on the treadmill and the mechanical stairs than on the bicycle ergometer. The mean VO2 max was 74% of the predicted value on the initial exercise test and rose to 85% of the predicted value after the 3-month physical conditioning program. Oxygen consumption per kilogram of body weight at a given power output on a given apparatus showed no statistically significant difference between the initial and 3-month tests, indicating no change in exercise efficiency. On the 3-month test, a statistically significant decrease was noted in heart rate at rest and after the 4-minute period of recovery from maximal exercise on any given apparatus. The data obtained in this study indicate that 1) the treadmill and mechanical stairs are more suitable than the bicycle ergometer for assessing maximal exercise performance and 2) improved physical fitness following a physical conditioning program is associated with an improvement in cardiovascular function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The 49-year-old patient in this case study received a left AK amputation in 1984 and was provided with a quadrilateral socket. She abandoned this prosthesis after 2 years because of her dissatisfaction with the device (ie, poor fit, awkwardness, excessive energy expenditure) and because of her compromised cardiac condition. The patient was fitted with a CAT-CAM prosthesis in 1988 and reported increased comfort, ease of donning and doffing, and increased gait efficiency with the CAT-CAM prosthesis as compared with the quadrilateral socket. The patient required 19 days of prosthetic training and was discharged independent in ambulation and transfers using two straight canes. We consider the CAT-CAM prosthesis an improvement over the quadrilateral socket for increasing ambulation independence in the individual with AK amputation and other medical complications.\r"

A glucose load test produced a rise in blood D-lactic acid in both. One patient has evidence of mild persisting renal tubular damage. The same patient responded to oral antibiotics but the other relapsed frequently despite continuous antibiotic treatment.

Inspection of flow-volume loops was used to detect upper airway obstruction and this suggested that 44 subjects (31 per cent) had the condition. Of these 44 subjects 19 per cent were men, which was a greater proportion than could be accounted for by chance. Flow-volume loops after surgery were recorded on 43 patients of whom 29 were from the group thought to have had upper airway obstruction. Comparison of measurements before and after surgery showed no important change in the 14 without, and improvement in 27 of those with, upper airway obstruction. Analysis indicated two failures of treatment and four probable false-positives among the group with upper airway obstruction. Inspection of the flow-volume loop had a 78 per cent specificity and 100 per cent sensitivity in detecting upper airway obstruction whereas an FEV:PEF ratio above 8 had a specificity of 94 per cent and a sensitivity of 64 per cent in this respect. Ultrasonography and plain radiography of the upper airway accurately predicted retrosternal extension of the goitre but did not predict upper airway obstruction. It is recommended that all patients with symptomatic goitre should have a flow volume loop recorded.\r"

Adenosine terminated 94 per cent of episodes of supraventricular tachycardia in 25 patients. The arrhythmia recurred shortly after adenosine restored sinus rhythm in 20 episodes. Transient side effects were common. Fifteen patients were treated with both agents. Adenosine was successful in all, but verapamil failed to restore sinus rhythm at least once in seven of the 15 patients. Early recurrence of tachycardia occurred in five of these after adenosine, but in only one after verapamil. Verapamil and adenosine are both effective in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia; adenosine has the higher success rate and is safer, but transient symptoms are common and arrhythmias may recur.\r"

Intra-arterial blood pressure was measured during a control period and during treatment with xamoterol, both in a cardiovascular investigation laboratory and for 24 h of unrestricted activity using portable apparatus. Xamoterol lessened the total number of symptomatic episodes of orthostatic hypotension by 67 per cent. Average untreated 24-h intra-arterial blood pressure was 132/78 mmHg; during treatment with xamoterol it rose to 138/90 mmHg. However episodes of severe hypertension (defined as a systolic intra-arterial blood pressure above 200 mmHg) were more frequent with xamoterol. Although xamoterol attenuated orthostatic hypotension, careful monitoring of ambulatory blood pressure may be necessary, particularly at the start of treatment, because of the development of severe supine hypertension. Intravenous test doses of xamoterol did not predict either the attenuation of orthostatic hypotension or the development of supine hypertension in all patients.\r"

Standard testing practices in graduate medical education work well in the setting for which they were developed. However, we now need to devise better ways to measure the continuing accrual of knowledge and the consequences of the application of that knowledge in the practice of modern medicine. How can such a determination be made? Who will administer the programs? How can we as physicians assure the public that we are capable of maintaining high standards of performance throughout a physician's practice career?\r"

Sixty-nine New Zealand albino rabbits were used in this study. One milliliter of fresh arterial blood was injected through the surgically exposed atlanto-occipital membrane over a period of 20 seconds. The procedure was then repeated 24 hours later. Fifty animals underwent digital subtraction angiography at one of the following prefixed intervals: 1, 3, or 8 days after the second injection hemorrhage. Nineteen animals underwent one angiographic examination prior to the instillation of the intracisternal blood. This procedure was followed by a repeated angiography 3 days after the second experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. For the purpose of evaluation, the films were magnified 10-fold and the diameter of the basilar artery as well as that of the extracranial vertebral artery at three different levels were measured. We assessed the diameter of the basilar artery as well as the mean ratio extracranial vertebral artery/basilar artery diameters. This ratio was considered to minimize anatomical and technical variabilities. The results in the first 50 animals showed a trend suggesting that spasmogenic activity reaches a peak at about the third day after subarachnoid hemorrhage. These results were confirmed in the latter 19 animals. However, mortality in this group was high: 50%. This double-injection model of subarachnoid hemorrhage in rabbits consistently reproduced cerebral vascular spasm 3 days after repeated subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, its usefulness as an experimental model for subarachnoid hemorrhage is limited practically by the high animal mortality in the protocols where repeated angiographic studies are necessary.\r"

Postoperative studies showed that no intraaxial or extraaxial hematoma was missed by surgical exploration. Nine children (53%) survived; eight (47%) died. The survival rate was higher among patients with a mass lesion than among those without. Seven children had a good recovery, and two were moderately disabled (mean follow-up, 15.2 months). We conclude that a significant proportion of head-injured children with clinical signs of tentorial herniation have extraaxial hematomas that can be readily identified and evacuated by immediate surgical exploration. The survival rate and extent of recovery in children appear to be better than in similarly injured adults.\r"

The subarachnoid hemorrhage was induced by injecting arterial blood in the cisterna magna. The following points were confirmed: (1) the maximal contraction produced by the platelets (10(7)/mL) treated with indomethacin or dazoxiben (thromboxane synthetase inhibitor) were suppressed (65% or 70% of the control); (2) the contraction of the arteries treated with ONO-3708 (thromboxane A2 antagonist) or ketanserin was inhibited (73% or 8.4%), as was contraction after subarachnoid hemorrhage (67% or 14%); (3) platelet-induced contraction was potentiated after subarachnoid hemorrhage; and (4) serotonin-induced contraction was potentiated after subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, synthetic thromboxane A2-induced contraction was not potentiated. The present experiments suggest that both serotonin and thromboxane A2 contribute to vasoconstrictions induced by the platelets, before and after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The platelet-derived contraction response is potentiated after subarachnoid hemorrhage and serotonin is responsible for the increased reactivity.\r"

The clinical presentation in this case was that of motor weakness and atrophy, sensory abnormalities, and, late in the course, pain. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement was better than myelography and computed tomography at delineating the intramedullary extent of the tumor. The tumor was removed microsurgically at two operative sittings. Reports of this unusual pathology are reviewed.\r"

Thus, symptom clarification patients are often earlier in gestation with fewer pregnancy symptoms, or may differ in how they perceive and interpret such symptoms when present, findings consistent with a tentative hypothesis that symptom clarification patients may not have anticipated being pregnant.\r"

This study, using the symptom sequences of 21 patients with panic attacks, sought to assess interpatient agreement and compare symptom rankings in patient subgroups. Median polish performed on the symptom sequences suggested interpatient agreement (F = 3.39, p less than or equal to .05). This was further supported by Kendall's coefficient of concordance using symptom runs for various etiologic models (W = 0.338, p less than .0001). The accuracy of the DSM-III to diagnose panic attacks was implied by the lack of association of measures of accuracy--patient effects and diagnostic confidence--with symptom rankings, demographic data, or clinical parameters.

However, there were different goals, depending on level of training. Content analysis of the observed AVR's showed that the four most valued teaching goals comprised 50% of the topics discussed in actual AVR's. Results of this study validate the use of AVR's as a teaching strategy for behavioral medicine skills.\r"

This was accomplished by means of a survey of 815 active members of the American Academy of Family Physicians. A total of 521 questionnaires was returned, providing a 64 percent response rate. The results of this survey indicate that the level of physician personal health activity tends to influence their reported professional promotion of healthy habits. In addition, residency faculty and physicians working for health maintenance organizations were significantly more likely to report offering a higher frequency of health promotional activity than physicians in private practice. Finally, age and family practice residency training appear to have no influence on self-reported physician health promotional activity.\r"

In all, 27 predominantly amelanotic neoplasms with unusual histologic features were selected for additional study. These included nine with an adenoid or pseudopapillary pattern, seven small cell neoplasms, five with prominent myxoid stroma, four with a hemangiopericytoma-like appearance, and two composed of neoplastic cells with a signet-ring configuration. A diagnosis of melanoma was confirmed in all cases by Fontana-Masson strains for melanin pigment, electron microscopic examination, or the results of immunohistochemical analyses for cytokeratin, vimentin, S-100 protein, and the HMB-45 antigen. One tumor was associated with a congenital hairy melanocytic nevus, five were vulvovaginal lesions, four arose in the sinonasal tract, and one occurred in the rectum. Four of the specified microscopic patterns were observed in both primary and secondary neoplasms; the two signet-ring cell melanomas were recurrent lesions. The authors conclude that malignant melanomas may assume the histologic guise of adenocarcinomas, small cell carcinomas, and sarcomas, in a variety of tissue sites. Special studies designed to detect melanocytic differentiation are therefore appropriate in diverse differential diagnostic settings.\r"

Banding resolution was separated into three groups: 400-band, 550-band, and 850-band. It was found that all 50 metaphases showed at least a 400-band resolution, and 1 metaphase showed a banding resolution between a 550-band and 850-band level. Although the chromosome preparations were sufficient for routine purposes, additional effort and banding techniques are required to detect small chromosomal abnormalities that require a higher level of resolution.\r"

A variety of coagulation studies and specific antiphospholipid immunoassays were performed to define the spectrum of antigen specificity of these antibodies. Coagulation studies showed an increasing sensitivity for the lupus anticoagulant with reagents of differing phospholipid content. Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) were found in five patients with the use of an insensitive APTT reagent and in 14 patients with a lower phospholipid content reagent. In every case, attempted correction of the clotting time with normal plasma was unsuccessful. Twenty-one patients had abnormal kaolin clotting time profiles. In seven of these patients, test results with both APTT reagents had been normal. Antibody reactivity was tested against three negatively charged phospholipids, phosphatidyl-serine, cardiolipin, and phosphatidylinositol. Only five patients demonstrated reactivity against phosphatidylinositol, whereas high antibody titers were observed in 28 patients against one or both of phosphatidylserine and cardiolipin. Twenty-three of these patients were found to have elevated anticardiolipin-specific IgM antibodies. Overall, 41 of the patients had at least one laboratory abnormality suggestive of antiphospholipid antibody activity. Seven of the 26 patients, taking phenothiazines other than chlorpromazine, had positive test results for antiphospholipid antibodies. No clinical thromboembolic events were recorded in any patient. These findings demonstrate the heterogeneity of antiphospholipid antibody specificity induced in patients treated with various phenothiazine drugs and indicate that none of these patterns of reactivity marks a predisposition for thromboembolism in this population.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, the morphologic, immunologic, and molecular makeup of a new virus designated human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) has been described. Because cell cultures of HHV-6-infected mononuclear cells showed prominent lymphocytic changes, it could be anticipated that mononucleosis-like illnesses or lymphoproliferative disorders would turn out to be manifestations of active HHV-6 infection. In the present study, blood samples from 27 patients previously categorized as having non-Epstein-Barr virus (non-EBV)/noncytomegalovirus (non-CMV) heterophil-negative mononucleosis-like illnesses were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies to HHV-6. Eight of these patients (30%) had serologic evidence of active HHV-6 infection. The clinical spectrum includes a short-lived febrile illness, mild cervical lymphadenopathy, laboratory data suggestive of active viral hepatitis in two patients, and a prolonged febrile illness in a single patient with previously documented positive anti-HIV serology. The viral studies revealed the presence of fourfold HHV-6-specific IgG titer increases by immunofluorescent assay (IFA) in seven serially studied cases and positive IgM serology on one or more samples tested by IFA or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in all eight cases. The authors could not determine whether the illnesses represented primary HHV-6 infections in susceptible individuals or reactivation of latent virus. HHV-6 serologic studies may be indicated in patients with mononucleosis-like illnesses with atypical lymphocytosis when EBV and CMV test results are nondiagnostic.\r"

The tumors were classified by immunostaining with antisera for synaptophysin, insulin, gastrin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide, somatostatin, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. Eight (47%) of the 17 tumors were aneuploid, and two (12%) were multiploid (had two aneuploid stemlines of cells). Seven of the eight insulinomas, one of the four gastrinomas, and two of the four nonspecified neuroendocrine tumors had an abnormal nuclear DNA content. The DNA indices of the aneuploid and multiploid cases ranged from 1.13 to 1.93, and three cases had a DNA index greater than 1.50. During the follow-up for up to 16 years (mean, 7 years), one patient with diploid nonspecified tumor died of the disease, another patient with a multiploid gastrinoma had metastatic disease develop, and a third patient with a multiploid nonspecified tumor was alive with the disease. The authors conclude that many neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas have an abnormal nuclear DNA content as measured by DNA flow cytometry. DNA multiploid pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors may be associated with a less favorable clinical course, but this needs to be confirmed in additional studies.\r"

The highest direct costs per year for unintentional injuries are attributable to falls, sports, and motor vehicle occupant injuries, while the highest indirect costs are related to motor vehicle occupant injuries, pedestrian injuries, and drowning. Injury accounts for 78% of the total fatalities among late adolescents (age 15 to 19 years), the pediatric age group at highest risk for injury mortality. A stronger federal and state commitment is needed to prevent childhood injury.\r"

Additional interventions targeted at the adolescent driver, substance use and driving, and improved occupant protection for all children will be required to further decrease occupant trauma. Lack of comprehensive trauma data is a major roadblock to the calculation of morbidity and disability rates.\r"

More than 101,000 life years were lost. A \"cost of burn injury\" model suggests a dollar value of societal losses from childhood burn deaths and injuries at approximately $3.5 billion. Very young children (0 to 4 years) dying in house fires accounted for 47% of these deaths. Preventing fire deaths through residential sprinklers, smoke detectors, fire-safe cigarettes, and child-resistant lighters would prevent more than three quarters of all childhood fire/burn deaths. While interventions exist for tap water scalds, solutions to the problems of \"kitchen\" scald and gasoline-involved flame burns are less apparent.\r"

The magnitude of this problem has only been recently appreciated, yet many questions on the causes and short- or long-term outcomes remain unanswered. One conclusion is clear: prevention is the best solution, but information on the nature of the brain injury, exposure factors, and effectiveness of countermeasures is incomplete. We sought to summarize certain basic epidemiological data on brain injuries in infants, children, adolescents, and young adults as well as findings on incidence of brain injury and current data on demographics and risk factors. We also estimated disability and person-years of life lost from brain injuries and highlight the value of helmets as a countermeasure for several exposures to head injury.\r"

Infection was more often associated with severe injuries of the large bones of the extremities than in amputation injuries of the digits and crush or roll-over injuries when the skin barrier was intact. The occurrence of infection in farm injuries was associated with prolonged hospitalization for parenteral antibiotic therapy, multiple surgical debridements with a need for general anesthesia, and permanent disability (decreased range of motion and loss of limbs and digits). Early aggressive surgical debridement and antimicrobial therapy guided by isolation and sensitivity testing of the major organisms are required because of polymicrobial invasion of vascularly compromised tissue.\r"

Although well informed about potential injuries to automobile occupants, parents knew little about dangers of pedestrian and bicycle injuries, burns, and drowning. Parents frequently mentioned \"being careful\" when describing precautions to reduce the risk of unintentional injury rather than mentioning proved safety measures. Parents of lower socioeconomic status demonstrated a more limited understanding of child safety. Physicians were cited as the parents' first choice for information on injury control and child safety. The parents' poor showing indicates (1) the importance of passive interventions and (2) the need for programs to increase parental knowledge of childhood injury and safety.\r"

  ".W": "Bunk beds are commonly used in American households, yet to our knowledge, no studies have been done to determine if they are safe. We prospectively studied the incidence, epidemiology, and outcome of injuries related to bunk beds. We interviewed all patients with such injuries who presented to the emergency department between February 1987 and February 1988. A control group of children who use bunk beds but who came to the emergency department for another reason were also interviewed. There were 68 injured children and 54 controls during the 1-year study period. There were 47 injured children (70% of this group) and 26 control children (48% of this group) younger than 6 years, which is below the age recommended by the Consumer Product Safety Commission for bunk bed use. Carpeted floors were significantly more common in the control group, 67% (36 children) vs 42% (26 children). Injuries occurred most often when the child fell from the top bed (38 children [58%]), fell off the ladder (7 children [11%]), or fell off the bottom bed (8 children [12%]). Injuries occurred during sleep (19 children [29%]), getting in or out of the bunk bed (13 children [20%]), or playing in or near the beds (28 children [43%]). Of those injured while asleep, 13 of 19 children were younger than 6 years. Head injuries accounted for half the trauma (35 children [52%]), and extremities were involved in 16 patients [24%]. The most common injuries were lacerations (27 children [40%]) and contusions (19 children [28%]), but 8 children (12%) had concussions and 7 children (10%) had fractures. Six children (9%) required admission to the hospital. Head and face injuries were significantly more likely if the top bed had no side rails. These data suggest injuries could be prevented if side rails were mandatory for all top beds, young children were not permitted to sleep in bunk beds, and all children were encouraged not to use the beds for play.\r"

We compiled data from 24 infants initially diagnosed as having shaken baby syndrome, including physical examination, roentgenograms, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, and autopsy (when applicable). Half of the patients showed no evidence of direct impact, and evidence of external trauma was not predictive of a fatal outcome. These findings indicate that shaking by itself is sufficient to cause severe or fatal intracranial injury and that the shaken baby syndrome reflects a spectrum of such child abuse injuries that may include direct trauma or only shaking.\r"

We describe the mechanics of a multifaceted campaign undertaken to alter this situation, involving a coalition of health, bicycle, and helmet industry organizations. These were the major objectives: (1) to convince parents that riding bicycles without helmets is hazardous, (2) to lower the price of helmets to more affordable levels, and (3) to overcome the reluctance of children to wear helmets. The campaign was successful; the sales of one brand of a youth helmet in the Seattle area rose from 1500 to 22,000 over a 3-year period, and the observed helmet usage rate among school-age children increased from 5% to 16% compared with a rise of only 1% to 3% in a control community, Portland, Ore.\r"

  ".U": "90266835\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE AND PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lyme disease is a major clinical problem in a number of endemic areas in the United States. In areas where anxiety about the disease is high, patients and physicians often ascribe clinical concerns to Lyme disease. Incorrect diagnosis often leads to unnecessary antibiotic treatment (often prolonged or repeated intravenous therapy). This report summarizes the cases of the first 100 patients referred to the Lyme Disease Center at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. RESULTS: In only 37 of the patients referred was Lyme disease, either current or preceding, the explanation for the complaints. Many of the patients had another definable arthropathy. Twenty-five of the patients had fibromyalgia, which has not previously been reported in Lyme disease. Three of these patients had active Lyme disease at the time of evaluation, and 17 had a history suggesting preceding Lyme disease. Approximately half of the 91 courses of antibiotic therapy given to these 100 patients before referral were probably unwarranted. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety about possible late manifestations of Lyme disease has made Lyme disease a \"diagnosis of exclusion\" in many endemic areas. Persistence of mild to moderate symptoms after adequate therapy and misdiagnosis of fibromyalgia and fatigue may incorrectly suggest persistence of infection, leading to further antibiotic therapy. Attention to patient anxiety and increased awareness of these musculoskeletal problems after therapy should decrease unnecessary therapy of previously treated Lyme disease.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To assess the effect of referral bias on the clinical spectrum of infective endocarditis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study comparing a population-based cohort of incidence cases from Olmsted County, Minnesota, with a cohort of referred cases from the practice of the Mayo Clinic during the period from 1970 to 1987. RESULTS: In the community cohort, age was an important risk factor for acquiring endocarditis (incidence rate ratio 8.8:1 for age 65 years or older versus age less than 65 years), but episodes in elderly patients were underrepresented in the referral practice. The proportion of cases due to Staphylococcus aureus was greater in the community than in the referral practice (p less than 0.02), while a trend toward overrepresentation of enterococcal endocarditis was seen in the referral population (p = 0.057). Symptom duration prior to diagnosis was significantly shorter in the community. Overall, measures of in-hospital morbidity and mortality were similar in the two populations, but advanced age was associated with adverse outcome in the community cohort. CONCLUSION: The clinical spectrum of infective endocarditis may be distorted by referral. The increased risk of endocarditis in the elderly underscores the importance of adherence to recommendations for prophylaxis in this patient population.\r"

  ".U": "90266839\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is a newly recognized syndrome that bears much discussion in regard to its distinction from progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS). In vivo microscopic examination of the nailbed capillaries has elicited the description of a characteristic vascular pattern seen in PSS dermatomyositis, and mixed connective tissue disease. To clarify the capillaroscopic aspects of this syndrome and to seek criteria distinguishing it from PSS, we performed nailbed capillary microscopy in 15 patients with EF and compared the results of this examination with those in 98 patients with PSS and those in 75 normal control subjects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of EF was made in 15 patients aged 25 to 69 years (average 43 years) who had an acute course, with painful edema and subcutaneous sclerotic induration sparing the extremities. There was a peripheral hypereosinophilia in all 15 patients. Twelve underwent muscle or deep cutaneous biopsy, including the fascia. Nine of these had fascial thickening, and an inflammatory cell infiltrate was observed in eight. The diagnosis of PSS was made in 98 patients, according to the usual criteria. Seventy-five normal control subjects were examined. All the capillaroscopic examinations were performed by one observer. RESULTS: None of the patients in the EF group had a scleroderma-like capillaroscopic pattern. Thirteen had normal results of capillary microscopy. Two had a nonspecific organic microangiopathic picture. In the group of 98 patients with PSS, 89 had numerous megacapillaries (p less than 0.001), seven had a nonspecific organic microangiopathic pattern, and two had normal findings (p less than 0.001). In the whole group of 75 control subjects, the features were normal. CONCLUSION: Our results show a clear distinction between the results of capillary microscopy in cases of EF and PSS. The normal pattern in EF seems to be another argument for its differentiation from PSS.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Blood platelet activity increases with advancing age. This study was designed to determine if changes in a key signal-transducing mechanism in the platelet, phosphoinositide turnover, are associated with the enhanced platelet activity seen in aging. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Platelets were harvested from a total of 40 healthy, non-obese, 22- to 62-year-old individuals, free of any clinical evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease, and having normal serum laboratory lipid levels. Studies of platelet activity included measurement of in vitro platelet aggregation and plasma beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TBG), a marker of in vivo platelet secretion. Basal and thrombin-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover was measured following [32P]-orthophosphate incorporation into the various phospholipids, isolation of the phosphoinositides and phosphatidic acid by thin-layer chromatography and autoradiography, and quantification by liquid scintillation spectroscopy of these radiolabeled phospholipids. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation with age for both adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced aggregation (1.25 microM, r = 0.464, p less than 0.001; 2.5 microM, r = 0.386, p less than 0.05) and plasma beta-TBG (r = 0.381, p less than 0.055). There was a time-dependent increase of [32P]orthophosphate (32Pi) incorporation into platelet phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP), and isotopic equilibrium was reached by 120 minutes at 37 degrees C. A positive correlation was found between age and basal 32P-PIP2 (r = 0.640, p less than 0.001) and 32P-PIP (r = 0.676, p less than 0.0005). Basal 32Pi incorporation into PIP2 correlated positively with in vitro aggregation (1.25 microM ADP, r = 0.795, p less than 0.0001; 2.5 microM ADP, r = 0.755, p less than 0.0005) as did 32Pi incorporation into PIP (1.25 microM ADP, r = 0.815, p less than 0.0001; 2.5 microM ADP, r = 0.795, p less than 0.0001). There was also a positive correlation between plasma beta-TBG levels and basal 32P-PIP2 (r = 0.768, p less than 0.005) and 32P-PIP (r = 0.505, p less than 0.066). Finally, increasing age correlated with thrombin (4 U/mL)-stimulated 32P-PIP2 hydrolysis (r = 0.694, p less than 0.01) and phosphatidic acid formation (r = 0.556, p less than 0.05).\r"

We demonstrated that in certain isolated instances, the proband and close maternal lineage relatives can have mixtures of mutant and normal mitochondrial DNA molecules (heteroplasmy). The proportion of mutant mitochondrial DNA molecules was found to shift markedly across generations and within the tissues of an individual. One unaffected mother had 65% mutant mitochondrial DNA molecules whereas her affected son had essentially 100% mutant mitochondrial DNA molecules. Two affected individuals had predominantly mutant mitochondrial DNA in their blood, but significant normal mitochondrial DNA in their hair. The demonstration of heteroplasmy within maternal lineages and affected individuals means that the successful determination of the mitochondrial DNA genotype of a family or patient with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy requires testing of more than one family member and more than one tissue from each individual.\r"

Xenon arc photocoagulation was used in 22 patients (58%) and argon laser was used in 16 patients (42%). At the time of data analysis, the length of follow-up was at least 58 months in all patients. Although all treated tumors were initially eradicated according to ophthalmoscopic and fluorescein angiographic criteria, there was subsequent regrowth in three of the 22 patients (14%) treated with xenon photocoagulation and in ten of the 16 patients (64%) treated with argon laser. The recurrences were observed on an average of 71 months after completion of treatment in the xenon-treated group and on an average of 30 months in the argon-treated group. More treatment sessions were required in the argon laser group to achieve tumor control. Complications of vitreous hemorrhage, cystoid macular edema, and retinal detachment were greater in the xenon photocoagulation group.\r"

The twin brothers' tumors were diagnosed at 9 years of age, and their conditions remained stable over two years except for a new, isolated lesion that occurred in one eye of one brother. The siblings' mother had a yellow mottling situated nasal to the disk in each eye that was similar in appearance to that in one eye of one of the twins. She showed no evidence of calcium on ultrasonography. The appearance of osteomas in three siblings suggests a choristoma as the cause of this tumor.\r"

Overall, 62 (32%) patients developed postvitrectomy fibrin; 25 (13%) had mild fibrin formation, 13 (6.5%) had moderate fibrin formation, and 24 (12.4%) had severe fibrin formation. By logistic multivariate analysis, preoperative factors that were independently predictive of severe fibrin formation included severe flare (P = .004), the presence of a previously placed scleral buckle (P = .001), and poor preoperative visual acuity (P = .007). Anterior epiretinal membrane dissection was the only intraoperative factor that was independently associated with an increased fibrin risk (P = .0003). A risk score derived from the multivariate analysis effectively categorized patients according to their likelihood of developing severe postvitrectomy fibrin. Results of this study may be useful in designing prophylactic interventions to decrease postvitrectomy fibrin formation.\r"

Sequential photographs and fluorescein angiograms showed a pattern of development common to these patients and not observed in patients who lose all central vision. The pattern involves formation of a pigmented ring around the subfoveal neovascular membrane followed by alteration of the membrane from one that leaks fluorescein to one that stains but does not leak. This pattern is associated with gradual resorption of subretinal fluid and apparent limitation of subretinal hemorrhage and fibrosis. This course suggests the occurrence of spontaneous involution of some subfoveal neovascular membranes and implicates the retinal pigment epithelium in this process.\r"

Light- and dark-adapted static perimetry in patients 10 to 15 years of age with early involvement showed a parallel and marked loss of rod and cone sensitivity across the visual field. Patients with more advanced disease and no measurable peripheral visual field showed different patterns of central visual dysfunction: an island of only cone function centered in a bull's-eye lesion; patches of rod function surrounding geographic atrophy; or a central island of excellent rod sensitivity but severely impaired cones. In the two least-affected patients, a 13-year-old boy and the asymptomatic 45-year-old sibling of a patient, there were more rod than cone abnormalities as determined by electroretinography and static perimetry.\r"

In vitro studies showed that presoaked collagen shields released most of the amphotericin B within the first hour of elution. We compared the corneal and aqueous humor amphotericin B levels produced by collagen shields soaked in amphotericin B and frequent-drop therapy at four time points over a six-hour period. The collagen shields soaked in amphotericin B produced corneal levels that were higher than those produced by frequent-drop therapy at one hour, equivalent to drop therapy at two and three hours, and lower than drop therapy at six hours. There were no differences in amphotericin B levels in aqueous humor at any time point between rabbits treated with collagen shield delivery and rabbits treated with frequent-drop delivery. The results of this study suggest that amphotericin B delivery to the cornea by collagen shields is comparable to frequent-drop delivery but has the potential benefit of added convenience and compliance.\r"

Only one of the 76 patients required an additional injection of anesthetic to achieve adequate anesthesia. No morbidity was associated with the peribulbar anesthesia. Local anesthesia, particularly retrobulbar anesthesia, has been used as an alternative technique in an attempt to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with general anesthesia in ocular surgery, particularly in those patients with high-risk characteristics. Even with retrobulbar anesthesia, however, there is a risk of morbidity and, in rare cases, mortality. Our results suggest that the use of peribulbar anesthesia is a safe and effective means of anesthesia in strabismus surgery because of minimal associated morbidity.\r"

Patients were followed up for a minimum of six months (mean, 18 months). Long-term intraocular pressure control and visual acuity were similar in the two groups, although the limbal-based group had significantly better early postoperative intraocular pressure control.

Symptoms of nasal hyperreactivity involving sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction and pruritus were more severe than in other types of rhinitis. The frequency of hyposmia was very specific to NARES. Nasal endoscopy and sinus CT revealed an evolution towards nasal polyposis in four patients. The nasal challenge to house dust mites showed the absence of any increase in local eosinophilia. Bronchial hyperreactivity to carbachol occurred in one case. There was no case of intolerance to aspirin. There was particular adrenergic hyperreactivity among the seven patients, evidenced by study of the reactivity of the cardiovascular alpha and beta receptors. The authors emphasize the features that are shared by NARES and by the triad, which suggest that NARES is the early phase of the triad. They advance the pathogenic hypothesis of an autonomic nervous system dysregulation with a predominating adrenergic hyperreactivity. Inflammatory effects of local release of neurotransmitters induce a switch from a neurogenic to a self-sustaining inflammation. Tissue eosinophilia is regulated by chemical attractants and activating substances of various origins and plays a major part in the chronic inflammatory state.\r"

Five groups of six animals each received the following: group 1: theophylline-treated, BCG-challenged, and sacrificed three days later; group 2: saline-treated, BCG-challenged, and sacrificed three days later; group 3: theophylline-treated, BCG-challenged, and sacrificed five days later; group 4: saline-treated, BCG-challenged, and sacrificed five days later; and group 5: no treatment and no BCG-challenge (\"absolute controls\"). Quantitative recovery of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells was performed and compared with histopathologic changes in lung specimens from each animal in all five groups. No significant differences in quantitative BAL cellular recovery were observed in theophylline-treated animals from saline-treated controls. There was a significant reduction in BAL cell number in saline-treated animals sacrificed five days after BCG-challenge (group 4) from that seen in saline-treated animals sacrificed three days after BCG-challenge (group 2). The most striking finding, however, was a marked diminution in granuloma formation induced by theophylline five days after BCG challenge (group 3). These findings suggest an antiinflammatory effect of theophylline.\r"

In certain outpatient settings, the clinician routinely uses one of these electrosurgical modalities on successive patients without sterilization or antisepsis of the treatment electrode tip. In controlled laboratory experiments using electrodesiccation and electrocoagulation, we investigated bacterial transference of Staphylococcus aureus from inoculated tissue to sterile electrode tips and from inoculated electrode tips to sterile tissue. With use on inoculated tissue, sterile electrode tips remained sterile after electrocoagulation but not after electrodesiccation. Bacterial transference from inoculated electrode tips to sterile tissue occurred with electrodesiccation but not with electrocoagulation. These results are consistent with bacterial destruction by electric current and suggest that bacterial transference via the treatment electrosurgery electrode from one patient to another is possible but much more probable during electrodesiccation than during electrocoagulation.\r"

History of a cosmetically inadequate response to one or both drugs used as a single agent was present in 50 of the 51 patients. Therapy was relatively well tolerated except by 1 patient who developed a severe irritant reaction and was dropped from the study. Mild to moderate irritant dermatitis was seen in all remaining patients. Cosmetic response was seen in 5 (11%) of 45 patients who completed the 6-month study. Cosmetic response was maintained in 4 (80%) of 5 patients who continued treatment for as long as 84 weeks. All responders had evidence of hair regrowth by week 12. The rapidity and extent of hair regrowth were greater with combination therapy than with either drug used as a single agent. Serum and 24-hour urinary minoxidil determinations showed enhanced systemic minoxidil absorption, which was probably secondary to the irritant dermatitis in some patients; however, no clinical evidence of a systemic minoxidil effect was found. These data suggest that combination therapy using drugs with probable different mechanisms of action may provide a synergistic effect in alopecia areata.\r"

A comparison of the thicknesses of CMM at LLNL from 1976 to 1984 with those from a nearby community histopathology laboratory showed that 74% of the LLNL cases were Clark level I or II, compared with 40% of the comparison laboratory cases. A matched-pair comparison controlling for age, sex, and year of diagnosis showed the LLNL cases were thinner in 58% of the pairs. The median thickness of CMMs at LLNL decreased faster than those from the comparison laboratory.\r"

Subjects with light skin, with a propensity to burn rather than tan in the sun, and with numerous or severe sunburns in the previous 5 years had significantly higher nevus counts than individuals without these characteristics. Subjects who acquired deeper tans tended to have fewer nevi than those who did not tan. Finally, children who freckled had higher nevus counts than those who did not freckle. These findings in children are similar to those seen in studies of malignant melanoma among adults and suggest that strategies to reduce melanoma incidence should begin with young children.\r"

Nongenital Bowen's disease has been less well investigated, although isolated reports, all of which involved detection of HPV after extraction of DNA from fresh-frozen tissue, have been made. We investigated 25 cases of nongenital Bowen's disease in 5 black and 20 white patients for the presence of HPV types 1, 6, 11, 16, and 18 using paraffin-embedded tissues. Human papillomavirus was present in six specimens from 3 of the 5 black patients (one previously reported to be positive on Southern blot) and 3 of the 20 white patients; HPV 16 was detected in all 6 cases on low-stringency testing, but only 4 remained positive on high-stringency testing. This suggests an HPV closely related to but not entirely homologous with HPV 16 in the 2 remaining cases. Five of the 6 positive specimens were lesions from the hands and feet and 1 was from the volar aspect of the arm. Clinical factors associated with the presence of HPV included black race, location on the palmar surface and the feet, young age, and verrucous or hyperkeratotic clinical appearance. Of the 6 positive cases, all 5 of the patients available for examination also had evidence of HPV-associated genital lesions. No specific histopathologic features were found to be indicative of the presence or absence of HPV.\r"

Immunohistochemical and electron microscopic examination confirmed that the cells of the plaque were dermal dendrocytes with phagocytic activities. The existence of the lesion since birth, the phagocytosis of lipid droplets by the cells, and the lack of associated metabolic disturbances suggest a fat-storing hamartoma of dermal dendrocytes that does not correspond to a known fat-storing or fat-producing tumor.\r"

Biopsy specimens from five patients revealed circumscribed, perifollicular or parafollicular lesions in which both elastic and collagen fibers were attenuated in comparison with those in normal adjacent dermis. These changes are consistent with scar. We conclude that the papules are a scarring process secondary to acne vulgaris and propose calling the lesions papular acne scars. They appear closely related to or identical with changes previously termed perifollicular elastolysis, postacne anetoderma-like scars, and papular elastorrhexis.\r"

Suddenly, with high fever, numerous purpuric, ulcerated, or crusted plaques with underlying infiltration or nodules began to appear on most areas of the patient's body. Biopsy specimens of the lesions revealed angiocentric and angiodestructive infiltration by neoplastic T cells and marked epidermotropism of these cells.

Reversible brain shrinkage, attributed to treatment with steroids, was found on 87 of 114 initial scans (76%); 14 showed changes in white matter during treatment (10%), and calcification was found in 13 either during or after treatment (10%). Eight children (6%) had fits, and in six of the eight there were changes in white matter or calcification on the scans. Comparison of the two radiotherapy dosages showed no difference in the incidence of abnormalities seen on computed tomography, fits, or serial IQ measurements, but children receiving intramuscular methotrexate had a higher incidence of calcification and a lower mean IQ at one year than those who received the drug orally, although this difference was not apparent later. Younger children were more likely to develop changes on computed tomograms and fits, and to have low IQs on completion of treatment, with changes most apparent in those less than 2 years of age. There were highly significant correlations between abnormalities on computed tomography, fits, and IQ. These findings confirm the neurological vulnerability of younger children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, show an association between abnormalities on computed tomography and intellectual deficit, and suggest that methotrexate is more toxic when given intramuscularly than orally. They provide no evidence that 18 Gy of cranial irradiation is less toxic than 24 Gy, and indicate the need for alternative treatment regimens.\r"

There were 77 girls and 53 boys with mean ages 5.7 and 6.8 years respectively and the peak age between the second and seventh birthdays; this reflects previous reports indicating that physical and sexual abuse predominantly involves young children. Patterns of injury that suggested sexually motivated assault included bruises, scratches, and burns around the lower trunk and genitalia, thighs, buttocks, and upper legs including knees. Pinch and grip marks were found where the child was held. The sexual abuse often involved attempted or achieved penetration of mouth, vagina, or anus, and physical signs were seen relatively more often than in sexually abused children as a whole. Four children died and sexual aggression and child death in the domestic setting may be linked. One in six of 769 physically abused children (16.9%) and one in seven of 949 sexually abused children (13.6%) have suffered both forms of abuse.\r"

Cooperation with testing was greater for OKP than Goldmann perimetry and in some cases OKP was better correlated with clinical findings. The advantages of visual field assessment by OKP for children are the close proximity of observer and child, the absence of the requirement for prolonged fixation, and the inexpensiveness and portability of the testing equipment. The disadvantages are movements of the head, with variability in the distance from the target, and the limitation to the central 25 degrees of the visual field.\r"

The mothers of each case, of two controls with diarrhoea of another origin, and of two healthy controls were interviewed with a standardised questionnaire. In comparison with controls with diarrhoea of another origin, respiratory symptoms were significantly more frequent in children with cryptosporidiosis: eight of 19 (42%) compared with five of 38 (13%). In comparison with healthy controls, preceding contact with a person suffering from diarrhoea was associated with the greatest relative risk for cryptosporidiosis, followed by travel in a Mediterranean country. Transient cryptosporidial infection of the respiratory tract may be common in immunocompetent children. In the area investigated person to person transmission may account for most cases.\r"

Primitive tumors such as Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors showed negative or low-intensity AO-RNA cytoplasmic staining. Differentiated sarcomas such as rhabdomyosarcomas and lymphomas exhibited moderate to strong AO-RNA cytoplasmic fluorescence. Acridine orange--RNA staining provides an easy, convenient, and inexpensive adjunct in the histopathologic differential diagnosis of sarcomas. It is particularly useful for distinguishing Ewing's sarcomas from other small round cell sarcomas of childhood.\r"

The skin lesions relapsed and recurred in concert with exacerbations of the gastrointestinal disorder. On biopsy, the sections showed a diffuse neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate.

Hydrocortisone's effect was shown to be dose-dependent. In another experiment, normal female mice received 0.10 mg/mL of hydrocortisone acetate for 14 days. Two mice developed aneurysms, and the others developed aortic ectasia. These experiments establish the role of hydrocortisone in the induction of aortic rupture in a mouse with genetic susceptibility and the induction of aneurysms and ectasia in normal mice.\r"

For elective cholecystectomy, average length of surgery was 76 minutes (range, 31 to 186 minutes); average length of stay was 4 days; total cost was $6240; morbidity was 10%; and return to work averaged 5 weeks. Average extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy treatment length was 136 minutes (80 to 158 minutes); average length of stay was 2 days; total cost was $5921; and hematuria and petechiae were seen in 33% and 28%, respectively. Re-treatment cost was $4880. All of these patients were active in 24 hours; return to work averaged 3 days. As results of the Food and Drug Administration study are still pending, recurrence and re-treatment rates are unknown. We conclude that extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is less costly, initially, with further reductions probable when performed on an outpatient basis. Though re-treatment may be required, return to normal activity is dramatically shortened.\r"

The records of 13 patients who underwent 52 strictureplasties for Crohn's disease at the Lahey Clinic Medical Center, Burlington, Mass, from 1982 through 1989 were reviewed to determine the results of this surgical intervention. Nine patients were treated with strictureplasty only, while the remaining 4 patients underwent concomitant small-bowel resection for stenosed areas not amendable to strictureplasty. One early complication occurred in a patient in whom a pelvic abscess developed. In a median follow-up period of 2 years (range, 0.5 to 7 years), 9 patients were rehospitalized because of obstruction from Crohn's enteritis. Four patients required further surgery, 3 patients underwent strictureplasty at a newly stenosed area of small bowel, and 1 patient required resection of the initial strictureplasty. Strictureplasty is an effective surgical option for patients with Crohn's disease who have symptomatic small-bowel strictures.\r"

We have retrospectively reviewed our experience with repeated surgical treatment for liver-only recurrence after previous hepatic resection for colorectal metastases. Repeated hepatic procedures were performed with no mortality in 10 patients. Intraoperative ultrasound allowed identification of three unsuspected metastases and determination of unresectability of two metastases during 11 procedures. Three patients were free of disease at 31, 41, and 48 months from the first hepatic procedure and at 15, 31, and 43 months from the second procedure. Five patients have remained free of hepatic disease. Patients whose initial metastases were less than 6 cm in diameter and had single liver recurrences after hepatic resection appeared to be the best candidates for further surgical therapy. These data and a review of the literature suggest that surgical treatment of recurrent liver metastases from colorectal cancer can be performed safely, and it is associated with long-term disease-free survival in up to 38% of highly selected patients.\r"

We were able to identify new venous pathologic characteristics and highlight endoluminal features, of both a technical and nontechnical nature, which have a probable causal relationship to graft failure. However, the significance of some of the endovascular findings that were seen during infrainguinal bypass grafting has yet to be fully defined.\r"

There was a 13% recurrence among patients with T1 lesions compared with a 12% recurrence among patients with T2 tumors. Size did not predict for local recurrence when the tumor was analyzed by 1-cm increments and whether the tumor was estrogen receptor protein positive or estrogen receptor protein negative. Patients with an extensive intraductal component had a significantly higher local recurrence rate for every tumor size compared with patients with extensive intraductal component-negative tumors.

Our technique involves complete transection of the infrarenal abdominal aorta, removal of a generous intimal flap proximally, and reconstitution of layers distally. We report our experience with 12 patients, all of whom survived the operative procedure. Nine patients were discharged from the hospital, and with a mean follow-up of 6.8 years, 7 are still alive. Fenestration immediately restored organ perfusion in all but 1 of the patients, and no patient died of late rupture. We recommend fenestration for descending aortic dissection in patients presenting with organ ischemia. Fenestration is not recommended for acute dissection with rupture or for chronic enlarging dissection.\r"

After correcting for differences in age and education between the two groups, we found that rigidity, stooped posture, graphesthesia, neglect of simultaneous tactile stimuli (face-hand test), and snout, grasp, and glabella reflexes were present significantly more often in patients with AD than in control subjects. These findings increased in prevalence in patients with AD according to the severity of dementia. However, in a multivariate logistic regression model only the grasp reflex, graphesthesia, and the face-hand test were statistically significantly associated with the degree of cognitive impairment. Although abnormal neurological findings occur regularly in AD, they are too infrequent early in the course of AD to serve as diagnostic markers. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether patients with the early onset of extrapyramidal or other findings form a distinct subgroup of AD.\r"

Although the presenile subjects had more severe neuropsychological abnormalities in all realms of cognitive function, including language, and showed greater reductions in regional blood flow than the older patients, they were also more severely demented, thus complicating interpretation of the results. Two indexes of cerebral perfusion, a ratio of regional flow compared with occipital flow and a left-right asymmetry index, demonstrated relative left frontal hypoperfusion in presenile- but not senile-onset patients and did not appear to be an artifact of the severity differences. Although no asymmetry of cognitive function was noted, the perfusion asymmetry provides biological evidence for an alteration in left-hemisphere function in patients with the early onset of Alzheimer's disease.\r"

In 32 patients (46%) seizures were not associated with identifiable brain lesions and were believed to result from human immunodeficiency virus cerebral infection. Phenytoin treatment was associated with adverse drug reactions in 16 of 62 patients who received it. Our results suggest that the majority of patients with human immunodeficiency virus and seizures do not have secondary focal brain lesions as the cause of the seizures and that human immunodeficiency virus infection alone can, and often does, cause seizures.\r"

We report a new magnetic resonance imaging observation in patients with early cognitive impairment due to human immunodeficiency virus infection. Fifty-two patients had a total of 86 magnetic resonance imaging scans during the study period. All scans were obtained with a 1.5-T system. The proton density spin echo (repetition time of 2000 milliseconds and echo delay time of 30 milliseconds) study demonstrated high-signal lesions in the region of the splenium of the corpus callosum and in the crura of the fornices. The lesions demonstrated no contrast enhancement with gadopentate dimeglumine. Pathological examination was performed in five patients. The fornix-subcallosal abnormality may be related to the memory dysfunction in patients with human immunodeficiency virus-related cognitive impairment.\r"

Recently, acyclovir has been proven to be the most effective available treatment for this disease, with the expectation that it would appreciably reduce morbidity. We performed detailed assessments of four consecutive patients who received acyclovir in the early stages of biopsy-proven herpes encephalitis and who now have been followed up for 1.5 to 4 years. All four patients showed definite residual on either clinical or formal neuropsychological testing, most commonly dysnomia and impaired new learning for both verbal and visual material, even though three had normal performance on a standard clinical mental status test. All four patients were unable to function at their prior level of achievement. Therefore, despite early administration of acyclovir in herpes encephalitis, long-lasting neuropsychological residua are likely. Furthermore, cognitive deficits of prognostic importance may not be detected by clinical screening.\r"

The common initial symptoms were headache and vomiting. Computed tomographic scans showed 50 hypodense and 49 hyperdense cortical lesions and in 20 patients the scans also showed generalized white matter hypodensity. Impairment of consciousness was related to the size of the hemorrhagic lesion. Dementia, seen in 11 patients, was related to the duration of the disease and the number of focal lesions on the computed tomographic scans, but not to the presence of white matter hypodensity. It is concluded that in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type, lobar hemorrhages account predominantly for the acute clinical syndromes. The hemorrhages often have an irregular shape and are responsible for progression of the symptoms after an acute onset. Furthermore, cerebral amyloid angiopathy leads to a generalized abnormality of the white matter, probably due to chronic hypoperfusion.\r"

Resting blood flow at the two sides was highly correlated (Spearman coefficient, r = .61) and no right/left differences could be demonstrated. In both patients and control subjects, blood flow increased approximately fivefold during isometric work (1/3 of a maximum surface electromyogram). Reactive hyperperfusion after isometric work was found in 8 patients and in 1 control subject. There was no definite correlation between the pressure-pain threshold and the corresponding blood flow.

In none of the patients with dysautonomia were both tests' results normal.

No patient with normal results on both tests had clinical dysautonomia.

Analysis with DNA markers at Xq28 suggested segregation of both ALD and AMN with an identical haplotype. This indicated that nonneonatal ALD and AMN are caused by a mutation in the same gene at Xq28. It showed, furthermore, that phenotypic differences between ALD and AMN are not necessarily the consequence of allelic heterogeneity due to different mutations within the same gene. The maximal lod score for linkage of the ALD/AMN gene and the multiallelic anonymous DNA marker at DXS52 was 3.0 at a recombination fraction of 0.00. This made a prenatal or presymptomatic diagnosis and heterozygote detection by DNA analysis with this marker reliable.\r"

Seizures arising from the parasagittal region were characterized by a high incidence of somatosensory auras (60%) and by tonic and/or clonic motor behavior (100%) and never exhibited automatisms. Conversely, the anterolaterodorsal convexity group never showed somatosensory auras but often had warnings more typical of temporal lobe seizures, only displayed partial motor seizure activity in half the cases, and included a relatively high incidence of automatisms (30%). These clinical differences may be useful in the localization of frontal lobe epileptogenic foci. The manifestations of anterolaterodorsal convexity seizures may reflect frequent spread to the temporal lobe, whereas parasagittal convexity seizures often show initial ictal behavior, in keeping with seizure activity in that region. Early ictal unilateral head turning without other motor manifestations was seen in 3 of 10 patients in the parasagittal convexity group and in 9 of 30 patients in the anterolaterodorsal convexity group. In 11 of these 12 cases, the head turning was contralateral to the surgical removal.\r"

The results in normal subjects were as follows: (1) tapping frequency lowered with advancing age; (2) men tapped faster than women; and (3) tapping with the dominant finger was faster than tapping with the nondominant finger in normal subjects. Tapping frequency can distinguish patients with motor dysfunctions of cerebellar, basal ganglia, and cerebral origins from normal subjects. Only the time-sequential histograms of tapping intervals could distinguish the motor dysfunctions studied.\r"

Data from 866 patients hospitalized between 1973 and 1985 were analyzed by age at injury. Outcomes were measured at discharge and 2 years after injury. Patients who were at least 61 years of age were 2.1 times more likely to have developed pneumonia, 2.7 times more likely to have experienced a gastrointestinal hemorrhage, 5.6 times more likely to have developed pulmonary emboli, and 16.8 times more likely to have had renal stones prior to first definitive discharge than their 16- to 30-year-old counterparts. Patients who were at least 61 years of age were 3.9 times more likely to have been rehospitalized during the second postinjury year than patients in the 16- to 30-year-old age group; 2.1 times more likely to have required artificial ventilatory support prior to discharge; 22.7 times more likely to have been discharged to a nursing home; 71.8 times more likely to be in a nursing home 2 years after injury; and 7.3 times more likely to have used hired attendants during the second postinjury year. Two-year survival rates were 59% for patients aged 61 to 86 years and 95% for patients aged 16 to 30 years. Although the prognosis for most patients with spinal cord injury has improved in recent years, older patients still have a comparatively poor prognosis.\r"

His blood pressure paralleled both systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output. Heart rate, rather than stroke volume, was the major determinant of cardiac output over a wide range of blood pressures. It was at times invariant for several hours and was unresponsive to carotid massage or respiratory cycles, but slowed slightly with each episode of hypotension. Trend monitoring indicated that hypotension preceded reductions in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. These findings suggest that hypotension resulted from a vasodepressor response with a vagotomized heart and that hypertension was the result of increased sympathetic activity. Both extremes were caused by parallel changes in vascular resistance and heart rate. Dysfunction of baroreflex buffering may have accounted for the rapid swings in pressure.\r"

The bone loss correlated with initial plasma levels of parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) concentrations. It has been suggested that these humoral factors may interact with cytokines or other mediators produced in the adjacent wrist joint. Losses of the cortical bone of the radial midshaft and the lumbar spine were modest and were comparable in the 2 groups. Indices relating to both bone formation and bone resorption predicted bone loss at these 2 sites, but changes in the parathyroid hormone and calcitriol concentrations did not.\r"

Following a 2-week drug washout period, patients were given either long-acting ibuprofen (2,400 mg/day) or flurbiprofen (200 mg/day); clinical, laboratory, and immunologic assessments were done biweekly for 10 weeks. A clinical efficacy index, utilizing a combination of measures of disease activity, identified 7 \"responders\" and 10 \"nonresponders\" (1 patient discontinued therapy because of a rash). Flow cytometric analysis revealed no abnormalities in the numbers of circulating CD3+, CD4+, or CD8+ lymphocytes in the 17 patients. The density of these T cell markers at enrollment was similar in patients and control subjects. However, following the 2-week drug washout, significant worsening of morning stiffness, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) was accompanied by a significant decrease (P less than or equal to 0.05) in the density of these T cell surface determinants, as is characteristic of activated T cells. After 10 weeks of NSAID therapy, increased density of CD3, CD4, and CD8 was observed in 47%, 73%, and 50% of the patients, respectively. However, in only the responders was the density of these T cell surface markers increased significantly (P less than or equal to 0.04). The responders, but not the nonresponders, also demonstrated significant reductions in the ESR, CRP level, serum IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) titer, and spontaneous synthesis of RF by lymphocytes in vitro (P less than or equal to 0.05). There were significant correlations between improvements in the clinical parameters (50-foot walk time, joint score, and global assessment) and reductions in the ESR, CRP level, and serum RF titer (P less than or equal to 0.05). These findings demonstrate that clinical improvement in RA patients treated with NSAIDs may be associated with the disappearance of phenotypically activated circulating T cells and functionally activated B cells, as well as with reductions in acute-phase reactants and serum RF titers.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the predictive power of changes in levels of antibodies to double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) as a predictor of disease exacerbations in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we performed a prospective study on 72 unselected patients with SLE (mean duration of study 18.5 months, range 6-35 months). Patients were seen at least once every 3 months, and disease activity was scored according to a specific protocol. Plasma samples were obtained at least once every month and were assessed for anti-dsDNA antibody (by the Crithidia luciliae assay, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], and the Farr assay) and for complement components C3 and C4. Twenty-seven of 33 disease exacerbations observed during the study period were accompanied by a positive test result for anti-dsDNA antibody (27 by the Farr assay, 19 by the C luciliae assay, and 23 by the ELISA). Twenty-four of these exacerbations were preceded by a significant increase in anti-dsDNA antibody levels (23 by the Farr assay, 12 by the C luciliae assay, and 17 by the ELISA). The first observance of a significant increase in anti-dsDNA antibody levels preceded the exacerbation by 8-10 weeks. Significant increases in anti-dsDNA antibody levels not followed by an exacerbation were observed in 5 cases by the Farr assay, in 7 cases by the C luciliae assay, and in 3 cases by the ELISA; however, in 3 cases, 2 cases, and 1 case, respectively, these increases were followed by an increase in disease activity that did not fulfill the criteria for an exacerbation. Serial measurement of anti-dsDNA antibody levels was more sensitive for predicting exacerbations than was measurement of C3 and/or C4 levels (P less than 0.03). Serial assessment of anti-dsDNA antibody levels, especially by the Farr assay, is a sensitive and reasonably specific method for predicting disease exacerbations in SLE.\r"

We also studied 23 patients with noninflammatory neurologic diseases, and 9 SLE patients without CNS involvement. CSF IL-6 activity was elevated only in SLE patients with CNS involvement, although there was no significant difference in serum IL-6 activity among the 3 groups. CSF IL-6 activity was not correlated with either the CSF-serum albumin quotient (Q albumin; an indicator of blood-brain barrier function) or serum IL-6 activity in SLE patients with CNS involvement. The CSF IL-6 activity decreased significantly when CNS manifestations subsided after successful treatment. These results indicate that determination of CSF IL-6 activity may be useful in the evaluation of CNS disease activity in SLE. Moreover, the data confirm the presence of immune system activation within the CNS in patients with SLE-associated CNS disease.\r"

  ".W": "Patients selected for the presence of scleroderma-related antibodies (anti-DNA-topoisomerase I [anti-topo I; n = 43], anticentromere antibody [ACA; n = 63], or anti-Pm-Scl [n = 12]) were studied for class I and class II major histocompatibility complex antigens, as well as for Gm and Km allotypes. Anti-topo I was associated with HLA-DR5 (70% of patients versus 30.6% of controls; Pcorr = 0.0018, relative risk [RR] = 5.3). All patients with anti-Pm-Scl were positive for HLA-DR3 (versus 23.5% of controls; Pcorr less than 0.001); 6 of these patients were DR3/4 heterozygous (50% versus 3.5% of controls; Pcorr less than 0.001, RR = 27.3). Patients with ACA were frequently positive for HLA-DR1, DR4, or DRw8, with 73.7% demonstrating at least 1 of these alleles (versus 41.2% of controls; Pcorr = 0.0152, RR = 4.0). This group of ACA-positive patients who had DR1, DR4, and/or DRw8 consisted mainly of a subgroup of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We conclude that different class II major histocompatibility complex antigens influence the formation of anti-topo I and anti-Pm-Scl. Important clinical differences between these patient groups and the immunogenetic heterogeneity support the notion of different antibody-defined scleroderma subsets.\r"

The distribution of HLA antigens was compared in CTD patients with and in those without anti-U1-70-kd autoantibodies and in normal controls.

  ".W": "Three generations of a nonconsanguineous family with premature onset of primary (idiopathic) osteoarthritis (OA) were studied for clues to the etiopathogenesis of their disorder. Articular symptoms began in their second and third decades of life and involved multiple joints, both typical and atypical for primary OA. Radiographs of the majority of involved peripheral joints showed abnormalities typical of primary OA. Evidence of chondrodysplasia was found in the spines. Pathologic examination of femoral heads obtained at total hip arthroplasty from 3 affected family members showed moderate to severe OA. Articular cartilage proteoglycans from these specimens were evaluated for aggregatability with hyaluronic acid, levels of chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate, and core protein structure. The results from each patient's specimen differed from the results of the other specimens. We conclude that this family's disorder, primary OA associated with a mild chondrodysplasia, was a late-onset overlap form of an epiphyseal dysplasia, that a defect common to hyaline articular and physeal cartilage was primary, and that a single structural proteoglycan abnormality was not likely to be the underlying cause.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of fibronectin (FN) on the course of chronic nephritis (induced by daily injections of ovalbumin) and on the clearance and catabolism of immune complexes in Wistar rats. Rats with chronic nephritis were treated with FN (2.5 mg/kg/48 hours) for 15 days after proteinuria was first detected. In rats with untreated nephritis, urinary protein levels increased from 40 +/- 22 mg/day (mean +/- SD) to 339 +/- 68 mg/day during the 15 days of the study (P less than 0.0005). This statistically significant increase was not observed in rats treated with FN (mean +/- SD 58 +/- 46 mg/day to 124 +/- 112 mg/day). Rats treated with FN showed a higher total serum protein level than did the untreated animals (mean +/- SD 6.4 +/- 0.3 gm/dl versus 5.1 +/- 0.5 gm/dl; P less than 0.0125), as well as a significant reduction in mesangial and glomerular basement membrane deposits. Untreated nephritic rats demonstrated delayed plasma clearance of 125I-labeled aggregated IgG (plasma half-life [T1/2] 3.03 +/- 0.6 minutes) and less catabolism of these aggregates at 30 minutes (mean +/- SD 15 +/- 1.7%) than did the normal rats (T1/2 1.5 +/- 0.2 minutes, 22 +/- 2.8%, respectively; P less than 0.0005). Both parameters were within normal limits in the FN-treated rats (T1/2 1.6 +/- 0.4 minutes, 22 +/- 6%, respectively). In vitro, FN induced a significant increase in aggregated IgG catabolism by Kupffer cells and peritoneal macrophages from normal rats. These results show that FN reduces the proteinuria and histologic lesions of chronic nephritis in rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Arthritis was induced in Lewis and DA rat strains after immunization with native homologous type II collagen (CII). Differences were noted in the clinical signs of arthritis in the 2 rat strains, which were immunized with the same arthritogenic preparation of CII. DA rats showed disease onset characterized by symmetric involvement of the interphalangeal joints of the hind feet. Lewis rats showed disease onset characterized by involvement of only the ankle or knee joints. Moreover, the arthritis tended to be chronic (i.e., persistent and variable redness and swelling seen in interphalangeal joints) in DA rats, but not in Lewis rats. Analysis of the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to CII and anti-CII autoantibody production demonstrated the presence of T cell, as well as B cell, reactivity to rat CII in both strains of rat. A spontaneous T cell reactivity to CII, as measured by rat CII-induced ear swelling, was observed in nonimmunized DA rats, but not in nonimmunized Lewis rats. The demonstration that clinical features of arthritis induced with identical arthritogenic stimuli are different depending on the genetic background of the affected animal may be relevant in understanding the heterogeneity of the clinical features of human inflammatory joint disease.\r"

Analysis of the autoantibody specificities yielded 2 major classifications: those specific for a single autoantigen and those that exhibited multispecific binding. Among the multispecific antibodies, 2 categories were found: an antigen-inhibitable group and an antigen-noninhibitable group. A large proportion of VHJ558 and VH7183 gene families was observed in hybridomas obtained from 1-month-old mice, and in hybridomas obtained from 16-month-old mice, there was a large proportion of VHJ558 and VH36-60 gene families. Among the autoantibody kappa chains secreted by the hybridomas, there was a higher frequency of the V kappa 1, V kappa 8, and V kappa 9 gene families.

When serum albumin concentration was less than 40 g/l, the mortality rate was 23/1000 per year compared with 4/1000 per year for a concentration equal to or above 48 g/l. A similar pattern was observed for cardiovascular, cancer, and other deaths. The associations persisted for cardiovascular disease and cancer even when deaths within the first five years of follow-up were excluded. These results must be interpreted with caution since there was no prior hypothesis concerning serum albumin. However, the strength of the association between serum albumin and mortality seems to be comparable with that for cigarette smoking.\r"

After appropriate intravenous, intraocular, subconjunctival, topical, and oral antibiotic therapy based on laboratory susceptibility studies, the patient's condition clinically improved, but complications resulted in therapeutic enucleation. Because of the ubiquitous nature of these and other potentially pathogenic organisms, great care must be taken in evaluation, management, and education of immunocompromised patients.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if abnormalities in the maturation of renal function in Dahl salt-sensitive rats are associated with the development of hypertension, studies were performed in anesthetized 3 week old salt-sensitive (DS/JR) and salt-resistant (DR/JR) rats whose mothers were maintained on 0.15% (low-salt) during gestation and either 0.15% or 2.0% (high-salt) NaC1 diets after parturition. Mature DS/JR and DR/JR rats were maintained on either 0.15% or 2.0% NaC1 diets after weaning and studied at 8 to 9 weeks of age. High-salt diet raised blood pressure (BP) and reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF) in mature DS/JR rats, but had no effect on BP, GFR and RBF in mature DR/JR rats. In immature DS/JR and DR/JR animals, high-salt intake resulted in poor growth with reductions in GFR and RBF in the DS/JR group. The response to acute volume expansion, (5% body weight physiologic saline infusion) differed among the groups. Mature rats all vasodilated while immature high-salt DS/JR did not, and immature low-salt DS/JR vasoconstricted. These studies demonstrated that both mature and immature DS/JR rats evidence abnormal responses to acute and chronic salt loading. Early exposure to high-salt intake affects the maturation of renal function in the DS/JR group. An enhanced vascular sensitivity to sodium is present at critical periods of postnatal development in DS/JR rats.\r"

Five groups of each strain of Dahl rats, salt-sensitive (S) and salt-resistant (R) rats, were given, respectively, a diet containing 0.3% and icv infusion of 0.15 mol/L NaCl (group 1, control group) or 0.8 mol/L NaCl (group 2), a diet containing 8% NaCl and icv infusion of 0.15 mol/L (group 3) or 0.8 mol/L NaCl (group 4) for 12 days, or an 8% NaCl diet and icv infusion of 5% glucose (group 5). The icv infusions were made into the third cerebral ventricle with an osmotic minipump. In the control group of S rats (group 1) the BP was 120 +/- 4 mm Hg, whereas the BP in groups 3, 4 and 5 were 154 +/- 4, 161 +/- 5 and 153 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively, and that in group 2 was 142 +/- 3 mm Hg on day 12. In the R rat, group 2 and group 4 showed a significant increase in BP over that of the control group. Multivariate analysis (quantification I) of these data confirmed that the BP of S rats was more sensitive to oral salt loading and that of the R rat was more strongly influenced by central salt administration. These results indicate that the two substrains of Dahl rats show different BP responses to oral and central administrations of NaCl.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the impact of increased afterload during physical and mental stress on myocardial hypertrophy, a homogeneous population of 73 patients with untreated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were enrolled in the current study. Left ventricular mass and cross-sectional area, both determined by 2-D guided M-mode echocardiography, were related to blood pressure measured at rest as well as during various stress situations. Left ventricular mass and cross-sectional area correlated with systolic pressure at work site (r = 0.28 and r = 0.23 respectively, P less than .05) and systolic pressure at complete rest (r = 0.35 and r = 0.33, P less than .01). Neither the response in blood pressure to mental arithmetic or a bicycle exercise test performed in the laboratory, nor blood pressure during both stress tests were significantly related to the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy. In addition, patients with a hyperreactive response to mental arithmetic or to the physical stress test did not disclose a greater left ventricular mass than normoreactors. Examining the hemodynamic response pattern during mental arithmetic, we found that patients with vasoconstriction during mental stress had a greater left ventricular mass than individuals with vasodilation during mental stress (244 +/- 73 v 204 +/- 53 g, P less than .05), but this was due to the impact of obesity on left ventricular mass (analysis of covariance: F = 2.1, P = NS). Thus, blood pressure at work site and at rest, but not blood pressure during mental or physical stress, nor the response of blood pressure to both stress tests, was linked to the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nineteen adolescent boys were studied, ten had 5-year average systolic or diastolic pressures above the 95th percentile, nine had normal pressure. A Del Mar Avionics Pressurometer III system recorded an average of 121 readings on each subject. The coefficients of variation for pressure were similar for hypertensive and normotensive individuals. During classes, eight of the ten hypertensive youths had elevated pressures in over half of the measurements. Also during these classes eight of ten hypertensive boys had average systolic or diastolic pressure above the 95th percentile, whereas only one of nine normotensive boys had average pressures above this level. We suggest that schooltime ambulatory pressures may be most useful in classifying the blood pressure trend in a youth.\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy and clinical application of a new portable device for measuring ambulatory blood pressure (BP) (ABPM 630, Nippon Colin, Nagoya, Japan) were assessed. The device uses a conventional arm cuff inflated by CO2 gas from a compact cartridge and is based on a cuff-oscillometric as well as a Korotkoff sound (microphone) technique. Blood pressure values obtained by ABPM 630 were compared with those measured by the auscultatory method. With the microphone method the mean differences from the auscultatory method were -0.28 +/- 6.15 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) for SBP and 0.96 +/- 6.28 mm Hg for DBP (n = 256), while for the cuff-oscillometric method the mean differences were -1.77 +/- 6.07 mm Hg for SBP and 3.06 +/- 6.87 mm Hg for DBP (n = 297). There was a highly significant correlation between BP values measured by the auscultatory method and ABPM 630. In 40 untreated subjects, 24 h BP was monitored simultaneously with the ABPM 630 and with a finger volume-oscillometric device (UBP-100, UEDA, Tokyo, Japan). The daytime average of SBP with the former (126 +/- 11.6 mm Hg) was almost the same as that with the latter (123 +/- 16.0 mm Hg), while the nighttime average in the former (117 +/- 9.7 mm Hg) was significantly higher than that in the latter (108 +/- 14.1 mm Hg, P less than .01). Only 4 out of 40 subjects experienced no sleep disturbance from the arm-cuff inflation. Five of the 40 subjects complained that their sleep was frequently interrupted by the arm-cuff inflation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The diagnosis was concordant with that obtained by traditional approaches in all three cases. Our results unequivocally show that nucleated fetal cells are present in maternal blood during pregnancy, and demonstrate for the first time that prenatal diagnosis of a genetic disease may be feasible without invasive procedures.\r"

Thirteen of 42 paraproteins reacted with at least one antibody in this panel of anti-idiotypic antibodies. Six different anti-idiotypes demonstrated reactivity with the paraproteins. A similar frequency of reactivity was found for both myeloma and MGUS proteins. One antibody, S30-47, reacted with 6 of 32 (19%) of the paraproteins from patients with multiple myeloma, whereas this anti-idiotype only bound to 3% of non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphomas and no cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This anti-idiotype reacted with both components of a biphenotypic paraprotein (IgG kappa and IgG lambda) in one patient. In each of nine patients tested, plasma cells isolated from bone marrow were shown to be reactive with the same anti-idiotype we found to react with the paraprotein. Antishared idiotype antibodies may provide useful reagents for studies of patients with monoclonal gammopathies.\r"

Adult marrow cells were incubated for various lengths of time with various concentrations of IL-6, in a serum-free system, after which tritiated thymidine suicide studies were performed. After incubation of 2 to 5 x 10(6) cells/mL for 4 hours in 5.0 ng IL-6/mL, increased thymidine suicide rates were observed for multipotent progenitors (CFU-Mix), granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM), and erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E). Similar incubations of fetal cells in IL-6 resulted in similar increases in tritiated thymidine suicide rates. In other studies, IL-6 used alone did not support colony formation from adult progenitors. However, it did support colony formation from fetal CFU-Mix (P less than .05), CFU-GM (P less than .001), and BFU-E (P less than .05). In cultures of adult progenitors, IL-6 acted synergistically with IL-3 to support CFU-Mix colony formation (P less than .001), but synergistic actions on CFU-GM and BFU-E were not seen. In contrast, IL-6 acted synergistically with IL-3 and with GM-CSF to support colony formation by fetal CFU-Mix, CFU-GM, and BFU-E. Thus, IL-6 appears to have a wider spectrum of action on fetal progenitors from cord blood than on adult progenitors; including not only the induction of cycling, but also the support of clonogenic maturation of CFU-Mix, CFU-GM, and BFU-E.\r"

Intravenous infusion of the purified MoAb (PC01) from this hybridoma also caused thrombosis in mice. The crossreacting substance was then isolated from mouse plasma with PC01 immunoaffinity column, which was identified as mouse PC by several criteria. Mouse PC prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time of mouse plasma, and PC01 neutralized this in vitro anti-coagulant activity. Therefore, heavy thrombosis observed in PC01-treated mice is likely to be ascribed to the defect of PC caused by PC01.\r"

  ".W": "A model of Protein C (PC) activation in vivo was used to investigate the complexing of activated PC (APC) with its plasma inhibitors, PC inhibitor (PCI) and alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT). Chimpanzees were infused with a bolus of activated factor X (F.Xa) together with vesicles of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (PCPS). Pre- and post-infusion plasma samples were analyzed using enzyme linked immunosorbent based assays (ELISA) for PC and APC complexes, and immunoblotting of PC from nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Within 2 minutes of infusion, a 60% decrease in nonactivated PC zymogen (PCz) levels was observed. This coincided with a precipitous drop in plasma activities of cofactors VIIIa and Va. In contrast, total PC antigen (PCt) levels decreased by only 1%, indicating APC generation. Complexes of APC with both PCI and alpha 1AT were observed on immunoblots, and further identified and quantified using a sandwich ELISA employing antibodies to both PC and these inhibitors. The distribution of APC between these two inhibitors varied with the dose of F.Xa/PCPS infused. At a dose of F.Xa/PCPS of 24.05 pmol and 37.70 nmol/kg, respectively, an initial spike of APC generation, associated with decreases in the levels of factors VIIIa and Va, was noted but dissipated over the next 30 minutes. During this period, APC/inhibitor complexes appeared with the levels of APC-PCI and APC-alpha 1AT reaching 8.5 nmol/L and 2.2 nmol/L by 30 minutes, respectively. In contrast, at a higher dose of F.Xa/PCPS of 36.60 pmol and 56.30 nmol/Kg respectively, complexes of APC-alpha 1AT appeared rapidly and reached a level of 6 nmol/L by 30 minutes postinfusion, whereas APC-PCI complexes were only present at a concentration of 3.4 nmol/L by this time. Additional experiments with lower doses of F.Xa/PCPS suggest that PCI is the preferred inhibitor of APC, but as the availability of this inhibitor becomes limiting, alpha 1AT plays an increasingly crucial role as a secondary inhibitor of endogenously generated APC. Moreover, evidence is presented suggesting the existence of additional inhibitor(s) of APC that may have a role similar to alpha 1AT.\r"

  ".W": "In this report we describe a platelet alloantigen system that is carried on a novel platelet protein of 175 Kd. Antisera against the two alleles (Gova/Govb) were found in two patients who had received large numbers of platelet transfusions. The anti-Gov alloantibodies could not be detected using a whole platelet solid phase enzyme immunoassay, or by a platelet glycoprotein capture enzyme immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies against glycoproteins Ib/IX, Ia/IIa, and IIb/IIIa. Using radioimmunoprecipitation techniques, a protein was precipitated that migrated at 175 Kd (reduced). Under nonreduced conditions, a 150-Kd protein was detected with a minor component at 175Kd. The detection of the alloantigens was not activation-dependent. Using immunodepletion studies, we demonstrated that each alloantiserum recognized an epitope on a discrete population of the 175-Kd platelet protein. Family studies demonstrated that the alloantigens designated as Gova and Govb were inherited in an autosomal codominant fashion. The phenotypic frequencies were Gova/Gova, 26%; Gova/Govb, 55%; Govb/Govb, 19%; giving gene frequencies of 0.532 and 0.468 for Gova and Govb, respectively (n = 33).\r"

  ".U": "90268104\r", 
  ".W": "Because the effects of red blood cell (RBC) concentration on hemostasis and thrombus formation have not been studied experimentally under conditions of whole blood flow without anti-coagulation, normal baboons were bled or transfused to obtain three different groups: a low hematocrit (Ht) group (20% less than Ht less than 25%), a normal Ht group (35% less than Ht less than 40%), and a high Ht group (50% less than Ht less than 55%). Measurements of platelet count, bleeding time, platelet aggregation, fibrinogen level, and coagulation time (APTT) were equivalent to normal values in each group. Thrombus formation was induced using a device composed of collagen-coated tubing followed by two sequentially placed expansion chambers designed to exhibit flow recirculation and stasis. The device was exposed for up to 40 minutes in an arterio-venous shunt system. Wall shear rates in the tubular collagen segment were 100 seconds-1 and 500 to 750 seconds-1. The accumulation of 111In-platelets and 125I-fibrinogen/fibrin was measured radioisotopically; RBC incorporation was determined from measurements of total thrombus hemoglobin. Thrombus that formed on the collagen substrate was rich in platelets and poor in fibrin and RBCs. Under high flow conditions, thrombus composition showed no dependence on Ht. Surprisingly, under low flow conditions, platelet thrombus volume was negatively correlated with Ht (r = -.73, P = .005), and was increased by greater than twofold in the low Ht group as compared with the high Ht group. Thrombus that formed in the disturbed flow regions contained relatively few platelets but was rich in fibrin and RBCs. The predominant finding was a positive correlation between RBC incorporation and Ht at both high and low shear rates (r = .90, P = .00003; and r = .77, P = .002, respectively), with thrombus volume increasing three- to sixfold between the low and high Ht groups. Thus, in vivo variations in Ht ranging between 20% and 55% did not affect hemostasis, but were found either to promote or inhibit the net accumulation of thrombus, depending on local flow conditions.\r"

  ".U": "90268106\r", 
  ".W": "Mast cells are widely distributed in perivascular connective tissues, especially in areas of active tumor growth and vascular reactivity. Incubation of metabolically [35S]O4 = -labeled subendothelial extracellular matrix (ECM) with lysates of bone marrow-derived mouse mast cells (BMMC) resulted in extensive degradation of heparan sulfate (HS) into fragments 5 to 6 times smaller than intact HS side chains. A much lower activity (seven- to eightfold) was expressed by intact BMMC incubated in contact with the ECM. These fragments were not produced in the presence of heparin, were sensitive to deamination with nitrous acid, and resistant to further degradation with papain or chondroitinase ABC. These results indicate that an endoglycosidase (heparanase) is involved in BMMC-mediated degradation of HS in the subendothelial ECM. Heparanase activity was not detected in medium conditioned by cultured BMMC, or in lysates of Ableson transformed BMMC and rat basophilic leukemic (RBL) cells. Both heparanase and beta-hexosaminidase, a mast cell granule enzyme, were released on degranulation of BMMC induced by the calcium ionophore A23187, or by exposure to IgE-Ag, suggesting that heparanase is localized in the cell granules. Under these conditions, less than 5% of the cellular content of lactate dehydrogenase were released. Degradation of the ECM-HS by the mast cell heparanase and the associated release of HS-bound endothelial cell growth factors that are stored in ECM (Vlodavsky et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 84:2292, 1987; Bashkin et al, Biochemistry 28:1737, 1989) may play a role in the proposed mast cell-mediated stimulation of neovascularization.\r"

  ".U": "90268110\r", 
  ".W": "Human erythrocyte transmembrane sialoglycoprotein, glycophorin C, plays a functionally important role in maintaining erythrocyte shape and regulating membrane material properties, possibly through its interaction with protein 4.1. Moreover, it has previously been shown that membranes deficient in protein 4.1 exhibit decreased content of glycophorin C. To further define the relationship between protein 4.1 and glycophorin C, a series of studies were performed using both protein 4.1- and glycophorin C-deficient erythrocytes. Quantitation by flow cytometry showed that the glycophorin C content of cells totally deficient in protein 4.1 was 9% of normal and that of cells partially deficient in protein 4.1 was 44% of normal. Interestingly, while homozygous glycophorin C-deficient cells had no detectable levels of this sialoglycoprotein, cells from obligate heterozygotes had normal levels. Protein 4.1 content of membranes of these glycophorin C-deficient cells was also normal. These data suggest that glycophorin C may be synthesized in excess by erythroid cells and its membrane content regulated by protein 4.1. To investigate if this regulation is due to association between protein 4.1 and glycophorin C, we examined the retention of glycophorin C in membrane skeletons (Triton shells) prepared from normal membranes, protein 4.1-deficient membranes, and protein 4.1-deficient membranes reconstituted with exogenous protein 4.1. Glycophorin C is retained by Triton shells prepared from normal membranes, whereas Triton shells prepared from protein 4.1-deficient membranes are totally devoid of this sialoglycoprotein. However, reconstitution of protein 4.1-deficient membranes with purified protein 4.1 resulted in retention of glycophorin C with the Triton shells. This finding suggests that protein 4.1 is necessary for association of glycophorin C with the membrane skeleton. Furthermore, these data suggest that through its interaction with glycophorin C, protein 4.1 may play a role in regulating the membrane content of this sialoglycoprotein in mature human erythrocytes.\r"

  ".U": "90268111\r", 
  ".W": "Defects involving alpha spectrin (Sp) are found in patients with hereditary elliptocytosis and a related disorder, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP). We have previously found that the severity of hemolysis was related to the total spectrin content of the cells and the percentage of unassembled dimeric Sp (SpD) in the membranes, which, in turn, reflected the amount of mutant Sp in the cell. However, no data are available comparing differences in the function of various alpha Sp mutations to clinical severity. We now report studies of nine homozygotes or double heterozygotes for four alpha Sp mutations: alpha 1/74, alpha 1/46, alpha 1/65, and alpha 1/61, whose red blood cells (RBCs) contained only the mutant Sp and no normal Sp. Sp alpha 1/74, Sp alpha 1/46, and alpha 1/65 homozygotes differed strikingly in the severity of hemolysis that correlated with the severity of mutant Sp dysfunction, as reflected by the fraction of unassembled SpD in the membranes and the self-association of mutant Sp on inside-out vesicles. Homozygotes for Sp alpha 1/74 had a very severe hemolytic anemia and their SpD were virtually incapable of self-association, whereas SpD alpha 1/46 were not as severely affected. The Sp alpha 1/65 homozygotes had a relatively mild hemolytic anemia and their SpD showed the least impairment of function. Ultrastructural examination of membrane skeletons from subjects whose SpD self-association was severely impaired showed gross skeletal disruption and loss of hexagonal structure. In striking contrast, the homozygote for the mildly dysfunctional Sp alpha 1/65 had only a moderate disruption of the skeleton. Some of the homozygous or doubly heterozygous subjects also exhibited a partial deficiency of Sp that correlated with a RBC morphology characteristic of HPP, namely, marked microspherocytosis with virtual absence of elliptocytes. These data demonstrate striking differences in the function and structure of various alpha Sp mutants that underlie differences in clinical expression.\r"
