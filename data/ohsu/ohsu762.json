  ".W": "In 3 of 18 aphasic patients pure deficits in semantic comprehension at the single-word level were defined through a series of tasks that excluded possible confounding deficits in auditory perception, visual perception, or speech production. In these pure cases, deficits were found at the superordinate, equivalence, and subordinate levels of single-word semantic processing. Pure semantic deficits were found to be correlated with damage to the left posterior temporal and inferior parietal region; patients whose damage spared this area did not evince such deficits, and the converse was also true. This study confirms the existence of separable deficits in semantic comprehension and points conclusively to the left posterior temporal and inferior parietal region as being critical for semantic processing. This anatomical localization is in keeping with anatomical studies from nonhuman primates, suggesting that these regions may be concerned with multimodal processing and integration of language.\r"

  ".W": "An underestimation of epileptic seizures occurring in aged patients is likely. In an epidemiological survey undertaken in Southwest France, the annual incidence rate per 100,000 persons 60 years or older was 127.2 for all seizures (101.3 in persons aged 60 to 69, 150.4 in those aged 70 to 79, and 139.9 in persons 80 years or older). It was 34.1 for symptomatic localization-related and undetermined epilepsies, 16.1 for isolated seizures, and 77.0 for seizures related to an acute situation, such as metabolic derangements, stroke, or head trauma. In this survey, seizures with an onset age of 60 or older represented 28.0% of the confirmed epilepsies, 17.5% of the isolated seizures, and 52.6% of the acute symptomatic seizures. These figures differ dramatically from those in most previous reports concluding that age-specific incidence declined through adult life. They are closer to the data from more recent reports. The main reason for such a high incidence of epileptic seizures in elderly patients is the number of acute symptomatic (or situation-related) seizures. However, even chronic epilepsies increase in frequency in aging persons. Cerebrovascular disease was the most frequently recognized origin (53.9% of the patients with confirmed epilepsies) and brain tumor was found in 32.9% of the patients.\r"

  ".W": "Seventeen patients were treated for 28 documented cerebral mycotic aneurysms. Initial neurological symptoms were attributable to aneurysm rupture in only 7 patients, and in 3 of them symptoms did not suggest subarachnoid hemorrhage. Six patients presented with embolic infarction and 1 with meningitis; in 3 patients it was uncertain if aneurysm rupture occurred. Four patients had rupture of at least one aneurysm while receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment and another had rupture at the conclusion of therapy. Of 20 aneurysms followed angiographically or with computed tomography during medical treatment, 10 became smaller or disappeared and 10 remained unchanged or enlarged, 1 with fatal rupture. Eight ruptured aneurysms were surgically excised; 2 of the patients with ruptured aneurysms died and 2 had residual aphasia or cognitive impairment. All 4 patients whose only surgery was for an unruptured aneurysm made uneventful recoveries. Recognizing the retrospective and anecdotal nature of our data and the differing views of previous investigators, we recommend: (1) that careful neurological examination, computed tomography, and (unless contraindicated) lumbar puncture be performed on any patient with endocarditis; (2) that those with neurological abnormalities not attributable to systemic toxicity, including pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid or apparent infarction on computed tomographic scans, undergo four-vessel cerebral angiography; (3) that single accessible mycotic aneurysms in medically stable patients be promptly excised, with individualization of multiple or proximal aneurysms; and (4) that repeat angiography be performed at the conclusion of antibiotic therapy in patients requiring long-term anticoagulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We found that the proportions of total CD8+ T cells and of the putative CD8+ suppressor effector subset (CD28-) were lower in the cell lines derived from cerebrospinal fluid compared with cultures derived from peripheral blood (p less than 0.025 and p less than 0.005, respectively; paired t test), whereas the total CD4+ T-cell proportion was higher (p less than 0.025). For a donor subgroup with \"normal\" peripheral blood cell-mediated activated suppressor function (63 +/- 2%), mean suppressor cell function mediated by unfractionated or CD8(+)-enriched cells derived from cerebrospinal fluid was significantly lower (38 +/- 7%; p less than 0.01, paired t test). For a donor subgroup with \"low\" peripheral blood cell-mediated suppression (-1 +/- 10%), suppression mediated by cerebrospinal fluid cells was also \"low\" (9 +/- 12%). Our results support the postulate that the immune response may be differentially regulated between the central nervous system and peripheral blood compartments.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of chromogranin A-like immunoreactivity in the hippocampus of adult humans who were free of neurological disease was examined by immunohistochemical methods. Immunoreactivity was restricted to the cytoplasm of certain neuronal populations, most notably the mossy fibers of denate granule cells (and a subset of their perikarya), and the perikarya of pyramidal cells of the cornu Ammonis 2 (CA2) sector. Additionally, staining was observed in neurons in the stratum oriens, a population of neurons at the periphery of the CA4 sector, scattered, probably short-axon perikarya in the CA1 sector, and fibers in the perforant path and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Pyramidal neurons in the CA1 and CA3 sectors were not immunoreactive. The two prominently immunoreactive neuronal populations, CA2 pyramids and dentate granule cells, are those spared in human and experimental epileptic brain damage, whereas CA1 and CA3 pyramids, lacking chromogranin, are characteristically destroyed in this condition. The known activities of chromogranin in the periphery as a calcium-binding protein and as a precursor of active peptides (autocrine inhibitory modulators) suggest that its distribution in the hippocampus may help to explain the observed pattern of resistance to epileptic brain damage.\r"

Forty-one persons in four generations have been affected; we have examined 7 of them. The two kindreds originated in a single small town in southern Italy and therefore are probably related. The illness was typical for PD except for early onset at a mean age of 46.5 years and a rapid course that averaged 9.7 years from onset to death. Clinical appearance and response to levodopa were typical for PD. Only one instance of definite nonpenetrance is known. Autopsy of 2 patients in one kindred showed the pathological changes typical of PD with Lewy bodies. Disease duration among affected persons who spent most of their lives in Italy was longer than for their affected US relatives, suggesting that exogenous agents may influence the course of this genetic illness. We conclude that what is probably a single gene without an additional environmental insult can cause the pathological changes typical of PD. Our findings therefore enhance the likelihood of a significant genetic component in the cause of sporadic PD. By identifying a toxic gene product, future molecular genetic studies in our kindred(s) may provide insight into the pathogenesis of sporadic PD.\r"

  ".W": "A site of DNA polymorphism linked to the myelin basic protein gene, identified as restriction fragment length polymorphism, was analyzed in a population-based study comparing patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) and population-matched control subjects. A 0.9-kilobase (kb) genomic DNA fragment (EcoG) encompassing the first exon of the human myelin basic protein gene, located on the long arm of chromosome 18, identified ten alleles arising from a region of DNA, 1.5 kb 5' to the myelin basic protein gene first exon coding region. Produced by RsaI digests and ranging in length from 2.05 to 2.15 kb, these alleles vary in size by up to 100 base pairs due to insertion or deletion, or both, from a 1-kb length of repetitive DNA. Allele frequencies among 65 patients with MS were compared with those of 63 control subjects. Chi square for these data was significant (p less than 0.001), largely due to a preponderance in the patients with MS of alleles in the 2.14- to 2.15-kb range. Comparison of the numbers of patients with MS and control subjects bearing specific alleles showed that 45% of the patients carried at least one allele of 2.14 to 2.15 kb as opposed to 19% of control subjects (p less than 0.005). These data, while preliminary, suggest that patients with MS differ from population-matched control subjects with respect to DNA polymorphism linked to the myelin basic protein gene. Although no pathogenic relationship between this polymorphism and MS can be presupposed, this finding raises the possibility that the myelin basic protein gene or some other myelin basic protein-linked locus may be a factor in susceptibility to MS.\r"

In 11, Sjogren's syndrome had not been previously diagnosed at the time of neurological presentation. All had prominent loss of kinesthesia and proprioception. Pain and thermal sensibility were less severely affected. Most had evidence of autonomic insufficiency. In some this was severe, with Adie's pupils, fixed tachycardia, and orthostatic hypotension. The course ranged from an abrupt, devastating onset to indolent progression over years. Stabilization or functional improvement occurred in 6 patients, 2 of whom received no drug therapy. Sensory nerve conduction studies and examination of nerve biopsy specimens demonstrated a wide spectrum in the severity of loss of large myelinated fibers. The cutaneous nerves of 6 patients had perivascular mononuclear infiltrates without necrotizing arteritis. Examination of biopsy specimens of dorsal root ganglia in 3 patients revealed lymphocytic (T-cell) infiltration in the dorsal roots and ganglia, with focal clusters around neurons. In the more mildly affected ganglia, individual sensory neurons were undergoing degeneration. In the most advanced case, very few neurons remained. The possibility of Sjogren's syndrome should be considered in patients, especially women, who develop acute, subacute, or chronic sensory and autonomic neuropathies, with ataxia and kinesthetic loss.\r"

Clinical features of these patients, including age, sex, disease duration, patterns of weakness, and reflex changes, were evaluated by review of records. In each patient the clinical features were compared to the type of nerve conduction abnormalities and to the specificities of high-titer serum antiglycolipid antibodies. Antibody specificities were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified glycolipids and carbohydrates as substrates. Our results show that high titers of antibodies to glycolipids are common in sera of patients with lower motor neuron syndromes. Selective patterns of reactivity indicate that specific carbohydrate epitopes on the glycolipids are the targets of the high-titer antibodies in individual patients with lower motor neuron syndromes. Several distinct lower motor neuron syndromes can be identified based on clinical, physiological, and antiglycolipid antibody characteristics. These syndromes include multifocal motor neuropathy with evidence of multifocal conduction block on motor, but not sensory, axons and frequent (84%) high titers of anti-GM1 ganglioside antibodies; a lower motor neuron syndrome with predominantly distal weakness early in the disease course, no conduction block, and a high incidence (64%) of anti-GM1 antibodies; and a lower motor neuron syndrome with predominant early weakness in proximal muscles and serum antibodies to asialo-GM1 that do not cross-react with GM1 ganglioside.\r"

In rabbits and in rats with experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, decremental muscle response to 3 Hz repetitive nerve stimulation worsened significantly after injection of the citrate anticoagulant.

Topical application of \"skin lipid\" liposomes prepared by the dehydration-rehydration method was twice as effective as was topical application of liposomes prepared by the reverse-phase evaporation method with respect to their ability to deposit interferon into the skin strata where the basal cell layers reside.

On the basis of a nationwide survey of over 500 isolates, it was found that the frequency of imipenem resistance was less than 0.1%. We have a highly resistant Bacteroides distasonis isolate, TAL7860, for which the following MICs (micrograms per milliliter) were determined by agar dilution: cefoxitin, greater than 128; moxalactam, greater than 128; piperacillin, greater than 128; imipenem, 16; and SCH34343, 16. Resistance was shown to involve both a beta-lactamase and an outer membrane permeability barrier. beta-Lactamase kinetics studies with several beta-lactams, including imipenem, revealed similar hydrolytic efficiency in comparison with those found for the B. fragilis strains. An imipenem outer membrane permeability barrier was detected for TAL7860, which was approximately sixfold more effective for B. fragilis TAL3636 and TAL2480. Significant inhibition of nitrocefin destruction was also shown with sulbactam and clavulanic acid at 10 mumol and dithiothreitol at 10 mM. No inhibition was seen with 10 mM EDTA. Differences in physicochemical properties and inhibition studies suggest that this beta-lactamase is different from the imipenem-inactivating metallo-beta-lactamase previously described in B. fragilis. We demonstrated a significant permeability barrier to clavulanic acid and sulbactam, which resulted in loss of synergism between these clinically employed beta-lactamase inhibitors and beta-lactam drugs. The novel beta-lactamase activity in conjunction with a limited permeability in TAL7860 resulted in resistance to all commonly employed beta-lactams, including the newest and most potent beta-lactam drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Nine strains of Tolypocladium niveum (= inflatum) were compared for their production of cyclosporins. Two of the strains, which were originally from the parental NRRL 8044 strain, were among the lower producers, while seventeen Tolypocladium strains belonging to seven other species produced no detectable cyclosporins. Variable cyclosporin production was observed initially. Once extraction and quantitation methods had been established, spore inoculum density and cultural morphology and carbon and nitrogen sources were found to be among the variables affecting cyclosporin production. Cyclosporin A was identified by cochromatography by using high-performance liquid chromatography, and cyclosporins A, B, and C were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy; all three compounds exhibited biological activity. They were routinely produced as a mixture in the ratio 7:1:2 in T. niveum UAMH 2472, which was selected on the basis of single-spore isolate total cyclosporin production and was used for most studies. This strain routinely produced total cyclosporin levels of 150 to 200 mg.liter-1 after 12 days of growth on a 2% sorbose-1% vitamin assay Casamino Acids medium.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of piperacillin administration on the dispositions of netilmicin and tobramycin was assessed in 12 chronic hemodialysis patients. Six subjects each received netilmicin (2 mg/kg) or tobramycin (2 mg/kg) alone and in combination with piperacillin (4 g every 12 h for four doses). Subjects also received a single dose of piperacillin (4 g) on a separate occasion. The serum concentration-versus-time profiles of netilmicin and tobramycin were biexponential. The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) of tobramycin was markedly reduced (59.62 +/- 25.18 [mean +/- standard deviation] versus 24.71 +/- 5.41 h) and total body clearance (CLP) was significantly increased in the presence of piperacillin (3.45 +/- 1.61 versus 7.16 +/- 1.64 ml/min). In contrast, the t1/2 beta (41.80 +/- 13.24 versus 40.07 +/- 10.37 h) and CLP (5.11 +/- 2.15 versus 5.55 +/- 2.32 ml/min) of netilmicin were not significantly altered when netilmicin was administered in combination with piperacillin. No change in the central or steady-state volume of distribution of netilmicin or tobramycin was observed. The disposition of piperacillin in hemodialysis patients was not altered in the presence of either aminoglycoside antibiotic. Although no adjustment in netilmicin dosing is required, tobramycin should be administered more frequently when given concomitantly with piperacillin to hemodialysis patients to avoid prolonged periods of subtherapeutic concentrations.\r"

Both drugs completely inhibited fungal growth when administered at a dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight twice a day, but only SDZ89-485 was fully inhibitory at a dose of 5 mg/kg twice a day. In a second experiment, treatment with SDZ89-485 was delayed until 8 days after infection to allow infection to be well established before treatment. Both 5 and 50 mg/kg twice a day were effective regimens, which establishes that SDZ89-485 has activity against spherules in vivo. Mice that received fluconazole (50 mg/kg twice a day) had a peak level in blood of 60 micrograms/ml 1 h after a dose, but no measurable amount was found after 12 h. SDZ89-485 was more slowly absorbed, reaching a peak level in blood of 14 micrograms/ml at 12 to 15 h after a dose of 50 mg/kg. We conclude that SDZ89-485 is more effective than fluconazole as treatment for experimental systemic coccidioidomycosis in mice, even though fluconazole achieves higher peak levels in blood.\r"

The compounds completely inhibited HIV-1-induced cytopathogenicity in MT-4 cells and HIV-1 antigen expression in CEM cells at a concentration of 0.8 micrograms/ml. They were equally effective against HIV-2 replication. In addition, and in contrast to azidothymidine, PAVAS and PVAS suppressed HIV-1-induced giant cell (syncytium) formation, a process that may account for the depletion of T4 lymphocytes in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. PAVAS and PVAS completely blocked giant cell formation at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml, whereas for dextran sulfate a concentration of 100 micrograms/ml was required to achieve complete inhibition of giant cell formation. As has been demonstrated previously for the sulfated polysaccharides, the mechanism of action of PAVAS and PVAS resides in the inhibition of virus adsorption to the cells.\r"

  ".W": "Daptomycin is a new biosynthetic antibiotic which belongs to a new class of drugs known as lipopeptides. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of daptomycin and vancomycin on tobramycin-induced nephrotoxicity. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated during 4 and 10 days with either saline (NaCl, 0.9%) or tobramycin at doses of 4 and 40 mg/kg per day (given every 12 h [q12h] intraperitoneally). Each treatment was combined with saline, daptomycin at a dose of 20 mg/kg per day (given q12h subcutaneously), and ancomycin at a dose of 50 mg/kg per day (given q12h subcutaneously). Daptomycin and vancomycin had no effect on the intracortical accumulation of tobramycin. Daptomycin did not accumulate in renal tissue even after 10 days of treatment. Tobramycin given at a dose of 40 mg/kg per day during 10 days induced a significant inhibition of sphingomyelinase activity in the renal cortex (P less than 0.01) and increased cellular regeneration (P less than 0.01), as measured by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA of the renal cortex. These changes were minimal when daptomycin was combined with tobramycin. Histologically, signs of tobramycin toxicity were also less severe in the presence of daptomycin. The intracortical accumulation of vancomycin was not modified by tobramycin. The sphingomyelinase activity was significantly more inhibited (P less than 0.01) when vancomycin was associated with tobramycin (4 and 40 mg/kg) without affecting the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After 400 mg of lomefloxacin was given once daily, no significant modification in the pharmacokinetic parameters was noted between the first and the fifth dose (maximum concentration of drug in serum, about 4 mg/liter; elimination half-life, about 6.3 h). After a dose of 200 mg every 12 h, a significant increase in the minimum concentration of drug in serum (0.49 +/- 0.1 and 0.72 +/- 0.2 mg/litter at days 1 and 5, respectively) and the area under the concentration-time curve (about 20%) was noted. The 400-mg regimen is probably adequate for therapeutic use.\r"

In uremic patients, the terminal half-life increased in relation to the degree of renal failure: from 8 h in normal subjects to 38 h in severely uremic patients (glomerular filtration rate, less than 10 ml/min). Renal insufficiency did not significantly modify the peak level in plasma, the time to peak, the apparent volume of distribution, or the nonrenal clearance of lomefloxacin. The dialysis clearance of lomefloxacin was 54 +/- 13 ml/min. Linear relationships were found between lomefloxacin pharmacokinetic parameters and glomerular filtration rate data.

After intraperitoneal doses of 4 mg/kg of body weight per day for 7 days, mean concentrations of AmB were 122.7, 55.2, and 4.31 micrograms/g in the spleen, liver, and lung, respectively. After aerosol doses (aero-AmB) of 1.6 mg/kg per day, the mean concentrations of AmB in the lung were 2.79 micrograms/g after a single dose and 9.88 micrograms/g after four doses, while the drug was undetectable (less than 0.1 micrograms/g) in serum, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain. The half-life of elimination of AmB from the lungs was 4.8 days according to serial sacrifices done after a single dose of 3.2 mg of aero-AmB per kg. Treatment with 60 mg of aero-AmB per kg was well tolerated and produced no histopathologic changes in the lungs. The aerosol route was much more efficient than the systemic route in delivering AmB to the lungs, and it limited the accumulation of AmB in other organs. Because AmB is eliminated slowly, infrequent dosing schedules can be used. These pharmacokinetic characteristics and its proven effectiveness in an animal model make aero-AmB a highly promising new method for the prevention of pulmonary aspergillosis. Aero-AmB should also be considered for use as an adjunct to intravenous AmB for treatment of fungal pneumonias.\r"

  ".W": "It has been assumed that penicillin (and also other cell wall inhibitors) kill pneumococci predominantly by triggering their major autolytic enzyme (an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase; referred to as amidase), resulting in massive cell wall degradation. Three types of experiments suggest that only part of this killing is due to cell lysis by amidase. (i) Suppression of penicillin-induced lysis by specific inhibitors of amidase protected pneumococci only marginally from killing in spite of prolonged exposure to concentrations of penicillin that were 10x, 20x, or 100x greater than the MIC. (ii) Mutants from which the amidase was completely eliminated by plasmid insertion or deletion (Lyt-) were still killed, albeit at a slower rate than the wild-type Lyt+ strains (3 to 4 log units instead of 4 to 5 log units per 6 h, i.e., about 1 log unit slower than the wild type; P less than 0.001). (iii) A new mutation (cid), which was not related to the amidase gene, further reduced killing of mutants lacking amidase to 1 log unit per 6 h (Lyt- Cid- phenotype). Reintroduction of the amidase gene into Lyt- Cid- cells partially restored penicillin-induced lysis but increased only slightly the rate of killing (from 1 log unit per 6 h in Lyt- Cid- cells to 2 log units per 6 h in Lyt+ Cid- cells). We conclude that penicillin kills pneumococci by two distinct mechanisms: one that involves the triggering of the amidase (about 1 log unit of killing per 6 h) and another, amidase-independent mechanism that is responsible for 3 to 4 log units of killing per 6 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "beta-Lactamases from Aeromonas hydrophila and A. sobria were purified and characterized. Both species produced beta-lactamases that were inducible by either cefoxitin or imipenem. These species were resistant to ampicillin and cephalothin but not imipenem. Isoelectric focusing of sonic extracts revealed one band at pI 8.0 and a second band at pI 7.0 for A. hydrophila. Likewise, A. sobria produced two bands, one at pI 8.4 and the other at pI 7.0. Two enzymes from each species were separated by flatbed electrofocusing gel and purified to homogeneity. The molecular weight of the pI 7.0 enzyme (A1) from both species was estimated to be 42,500, whereas the pI 8.0 (A2h) and 8.4 (A2s) enzymes of A. hydrophila and A. sobria had molecular weights of 31,500 and 35,000, respectively, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The relative Vmax values for cephalothin, penicillin, and imipenem for these enzymes indicated that A1 was primarily a cephalosporinase while A2h and A2s were penicillinases highly active against carbapenems. A1 was susceptible to inhibition by cloxacillin, while the A2 enzymes were inhibited by clavulanic acid and EDTA and required zinc for activity. Thus, there appear to be two distinct inducible beta-lactamases in A. hydrophila and A. sobria that play an important role in the beta-lactam resistance of these species.\r"

  ".U": "90225733\r", 
  ".W": "The susceptibility to ciprofloxacin of 548 clinical isolates of rapidly growing mycobacteria belonging to eight subgroups or species was determined. The 170 isolates of Mycobacterium fortuitum biovar.fortuitum were most susceptible; the MIC for 90% of the organisms was 0.125 micrograms/ml. The other biovariants of M. fortuitum, M. smegmatis, and the M. chelonae-like organisms were less susceptible; the modal MIC was 0.5 micrograms/ml, and the MIC for 90% of organisms was 1.0 micrograms/ml. The two subspecies of M. chelonae were generally resistant, with only 8% of 206 isolates falling in the moderately susceptible category (MIC, 2 micrograms/ml) and only 2% falling in the susceptible category (MIC, less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml). MICs of ofloxacin averaged 1 to 2 dilutions higher than those of ciprofloxacin for all subgroups tested. Three patients with M. fortuitum cutaneous disease relapsed after an initial response to therapy with ciprofloxacin, and their isolate was shown to have acquired drug resistance. Mutational frequencies for M. fortuitum with ciprofloxacin were relatively high (10(-5) to 10(-7), and MICs for single-step mutants were similar to those for the clinically resistant strains. Thus, despite the excellent activity of ciprofloxacin against rapidly growing mycobacterial groups other than M. chelonae, single-drug therapy should be used with caution because of the risk of development of mutational resistance.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin were determined in six healthy volunteers after oral administration of 200 mg twice daily for 3.5 days. To study the pharmacokinetic behavior at the target site in bacterial infection of the skin, drug concentrations were determined in suction blister fluid (SBF) and cantharides blister fluid (CBF), as well as in serum and saliva. Ofloxacin was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatographic assay. Ofloxacin concentrations in saliva amounted to 61 +/- 3% of levels in serum. After the final dose, ofloxacin concentrations in blister fluid and serum declined in parallel. Terminal half-lives of ofloxacin in blister fluids (SBF, 7.0 h; CBF, 6.3 h) were in accordance with serum half-life (6.6 h). Favorable penetration into the skin is suggested by high area under the concentration-time curve ratios for blister fluid and serum (CBF, 1.1; SBF, 1.3). During repeated ofloxacin intake, drug levels in SBF and CBF at 12 h amounted to 0.94 and 1.10 micrograms/ml. Thus, ofloxacin levels in the skin are well above the MIC for 90% of strains tested for, e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and various members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. This should also hold true with respect to other tissues.\r"

Simulated 500-mg oral doses of dicloxacillin (approximately 96% bound) or cephalexin (less than 5% bound) were administered every 6 h for four doses. A 10-fold-higher dose of dicloxacillin was also studied to determine the effect of drug concentration on the reduction of bacterial killing in the presence of protein. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 was inoculated into peripheral chambers filled with either Mueller-Hinton broth or Mueller-Hinton broth plus 25% human serum. Serial samples for bacterial counts were collected over 24 h. The presence of serum in the chambers significantly reduced bacterial killing by dicloxacillin but not by cephalexin during the first 6 h (two-way analysis of variance, F = 6.04, P less than 0.05) but not at 24 h. Reduction of dicloxacillin activity in serum-containing chambers persisted with the higher dose. These data suggest that despite attaining higher total drug concentrations in protein-containing extravascular spaces with highly bound drugs, protein binding reduces bactericidal activity during the early stages of treatment in this model.\r"

The subjects were divided into groups of 12 per dose group. All subjects completed the study, and BMY-28100 was well tolerated at all doses. The maximum concentration of the drug in plasma ranged from 6.2 to 17.7 micrograms/ml for the 250- and 1,000-mg doses, respectively, and the area under the curve increased in a dose-proportional manner. The elimination half-life and renal clearance averages were 1.2 h and 200 ml/min, respectively. The values for renal clearance suggest that BMY-28100 is excreted by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Mean concentrations of the drug in urine were highest during the first 4 h after the doses and ranged from 175 to 658 micrograms/ml following the 250- and 1,000-mg doses, respectively. The mean urinary recovery ranged from 57 to 70% of the dose. The results from this Phase I study indicate that BMY-28100 is well tolerated and exhibits linear pharmacokinetics.\r"

A beta-lactamase-producing strain of Staphylococcus aureus, when inoculated in a similar manner, did not persist adequately in the lungs long enough to permit a reasonable assessment of the therapy, but staphylococcal survival was extended in the lungs of rats infected 24 h previously with S. pneumoniae. Amoxicillin therapy was relatively ineffective against the pneumococci in this polymicrobial infection and had no effect on the growth of S. aureus. In contrast, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid eliminated the pneumococci from the lung tissue and brought about a reduction in the numbers of staphylococci. The data illustrate the utility of this model for the study of polymicrobial lung infections and demonstrate the role of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in the treatment of polymicrobial infections involving beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.\r"

A total of 102 patients with hematological malignancies were randomly selected to receive either co-trimoxazole or ofloxacin. All patients were monitored for compliance, occurrence of infection, and drug-related side effects. A surveillance culture of a rectal swab was performed regularly. A total of 25 of the 52 patients (48%) who received co-trimoxazole and 11 of the 50 patients (22%) who received ofloxacin developed fever during the study period (P less than 0.025). Gram-negative bacteremia occurred in nine patients in the co-trimoxazole group (17%) but in only one patient (2%) in the ofloxacin group (P less than 0.05). No patient in either group had documented gram-positive bacterial or Pneumocystis carinii infection. Poor performance status was the only identifiable factor associated with an increased incidence of bacteremia. The surveillance study showed that significantly fewer bacterial strains were resistant to ofloxacin than to co-trimoxazole and that acquisition of resistance to co-trimoxazole was more commonly observed than was acquisition of resistance to ofloxacin. Significantly more patients had skin rashes following co-trimoxazole than ofloxacin treatment (P less than 0.05). Ofloxacin was superior to co-trimoxazole in preventing infection in this population of neutropenic patients.\r"

All the strains harbored an Inc7 or M self-transferable plasmid with a size of approximately 85 kilobases. The plasmids had closely related EcoRI, HincII, HindIII, and PvuII restriction endonuclease-generated patterns and conferred resistance to all beta-lactams, except cephamycins and imipenem; to tetracycline, because of the presence of the genes blatem-3 and tetC, respectively, as determined by hybridization with specific probes; and to sulfonamide. Depending on the presence or absence and level of expression of the genes aacA4, aadA, and dfrI and of insertion element IS15, four types of plasmids could be distinguished. Plasmid pCFF04, the prototype plasmid encoding TEM-3, was widespread and appeared, by Southern hybridization, as the progenitor of the other types of replicons. The plasmid epidemic responsible for dissemination of TEM-3 in clinical isolates of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae may have originated in S. marcescens since pCFF04 was first detected in this species.\r"

The present experiments attempted to elucidate the mechanism by using a novel hemorheologic probe, pentoxifylline (PTX). Acute studies were performed with rats given single intravenous doses of AmpB (1 mg/kg of body weight) with or without intraperitoneal PTX (45 mg/kg). Renal function, assessed by inulin clearance (CLIN) and electrolyte handling, and morphology were compared with those of controls given sterile water and PTX. A significant decrease in CLIN not observed in rats given AmpB and PTX or in the controls was found in rats given AmpB. Electrolyte handling was not different among groups. Whereas pronounced (3 and 4+ on a scale of mild to significant [1+ to 4+]) vascular congestion was found in rats given AmpB, rats coadministered PTX had mild (1 and 2+) medullary and glomerular vascular congestion. In chronic studies, intravenous AmpB (1 mg/kg per day) or sterile water was coadministered with intraperitoneal PTX (45 mg/kg every 12 h) or saline for 10 days. Mean CLIN of rats coadministered AmpB and PTX was not significantly different from that of PTX control rats (1.61 +/- 0.19 versus 1.31 +/- 0.29 ml/min per g of kidney weight). A 46% decline in CLIN was found in rats treated with AmpB and saline (P less than 0.05).

  ".W": "Vancomycin and a new antibiotic, daptomycin (LY146032), were tested in vitro and in vivo against Staphylococcus aureus. In vivo tests were performed with rabbits with kaolin-induced hydrocephalus. Five groups of rabbits were studied: untreated ventriculitis, intraventricular vancomycin only, and ventriculitis treated with intraventricular vancomycin (30 micrograms or 120 micrograms) or daptomycin (7.5 micrograms). Results of this study were as follows. (i) S. aureus demonstrated static growth in cerebrospinal fluid in vitro and in ventriculitis at a maximum titer of 10(5) to 10(6) CFU/ml. (ii) In vitro time kill curves in cerebrospinal fluid matched those in vivo. (iii) Single-dose intraventricular vancomycin did not lower S. aureus concentrations over 8 h, whereas daptomycin did. (iv) Ventriculitis did not significantly alter the clearance of intraventricular vancomycin. (v) Intraventricular half-lives were approximately 2.8 h (maximum) for vancomycin and 4.5 h for daptomycin. (vi) Vancomycin was detectable in the periventricular white matter only in the presence of ventriculitis. Daptomycin was also detectable in the periventricular white matter of rabbits with ventriculitis, but in amounts too small to quantitate. We concluded that daptomycin achieved greater bactericidal activity, more rapid killing kinetics, and a longer half-life in the ventricle than vancomycin did in this model.\r"

Rabbits infected with either a methicillin-susceptible (MSSA-1199) or a methicillin-resistant (MRSA-494) test strain were treated with ofloxacin (20 mg/kg of body weight every 8 h) or vancomycin (17.5 mg/kg of body weight every 6 h) for 4 days. The antimicrobial agents were found to be equally effective in clearing bacteremia and in reducing bacterial counts in vegetations and in renal and splenic tissue of animals infected with either test strain. The drugs were of equal efficacy in curing MRSA-494 endocarditis. No resistance to ofloxacin emerged in either test strain during therapy. We conclude that in this model ofloxacin is as efficacious as vancomycin and that, unlike for other fluoroquinolones we have evaluated, resistance to the drug does not develop during therapy of this serious S. aureus infection.\r"

Of the viridans group streptococci, 82% of the strains hybridized with one (34%) or more (66%) of the four probes. The distribution of the four determinants in this group was as follows: Tet K, 36%; Tet L, 31%; Tet M, 43%; Tet O, 61%. Twenty-nine percent of the enterococci and forty-six percent of the group B streptococci hybridized with the probes; however, the Tet K, Tet L, and Tet O determinants were found in only a few strains, while the Tet M determinant predominated. A total of 29% of the F. nucleatum isolates, 55% of the G. vaginalis isolates, and 26% of the V. parvula isolates hybridized with the Tet M determinant. In contrast, 43% of the Lactobacillus spp. hybridized with the Tet O determinant.

The medication was infused over 45 min. Trough and peak serum samples as well as two additional samples were taken at steady state. The results showed a statistically significant inverse relationship between half-life (8.42 +/- 2.55 h) and postconceptional age (P = 0.002) and a direct correlation between total body clearance (0.84 +/- 0.28 ml/min per kg) and postconceptional age (P = 0.02). These pharmacokinetic data were used to calculate a new dosage schedule for preterm infants. The derived intravenous dosage of amikacin for infants of less than 30 weeks of postconceptional age was 9 mg/kg every 18 h. For infants of greater than 30 weeks of postconceptional age, the dosage was 9 mg/kg every 12 h. Peak and trough levels of amikacin in serum that fell within the therapeutic range were compared by using the currently recommended dosage schedule and the dosage schedule derived from our pharmacokinetic data. There was a reduction in the number of peak and trough levels that fell outside the accepted therapeutic range which was not statistically significant. Extension of the dosing interval and a further increase in the dosage may result in further improvement. Based on these data, the current recommendations are inadequate for the preterm infant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The cellular-to-extracellular-concentration ratios (C/E) of (-)-ofloxacin were always higher than 6, significantly greater than those of ofloxacin at extracellular concentrations of 5 and 10 mg/liter. The penetration of (-)-ofloxacin and ofloxacin was doubled when neutrophils were stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate but not affected after ingestion of opsonized Staphylococcus aureus. The C/E ratios of (-)-ofloxacin and ofloxacin for different tissue culture epithelial cells and fibroblasts were lower than those of neutrophils but still higher than 2. Both compounds produced a significant reduction in viable intraphagocytic S. aureus during 3 h of exposure to antimicrobial agents. We conclude that (-)-ofloxacin appears to reach higher intracellular concentrations than ofloxacin, remaining active inside the neutrophils.\r"

A number of other carbocyclic oxetanocin analogs failed to exert good antiretroviral effects. Both cyclobut-A and cyclobut-G protected CD4+ ATH8 cells against the infectivity and cytopathic effect of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and suppressed proviral DNA synthesis in ATH8 cells exposed to HIV-1 in vitro at concentrations of 50 to 100 microM. These compounds also inhibited the in vitro infectivity of another human pathogenic retrovirus, HIV-2. Furthermore, both compounds completely suppressed the replication of a monocytotropic strain of HIV-1 in monocytes and macrophages at concentrations as low as 0.5 microM, as assessed by inhibition of HIV-1 p24 gag protein production. We also found that 2'-deoxyguanosine readily reversed the antiretroviral activity of cyclobut-G in our system, whereas the activity of cyclobut-A was hardly reversed by 2'-deoxyadenosine or 2'-deoxycytidine. We noted, however, that these compounds inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells at concentrations of greater than or equal to 100 microM in vitro. Although both cyclobut-A and cyclobut-G appear to have a certain level of in vitro toxicity, our observations may have theoretical and clinical implications in understanding the structure-activity relationships of antiretroviral agents active against HIV.\r"

Like other fluoroquinolone compounds, WIN 57273 was active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (97% of strains inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus, Branhamella, and Neisseria strains (100% susceptible), Acinetobacter spp. (100% susceptible), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (68% susceptible). We observed that WIN 57273 was very active against cephalosporin- or aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative strains but shared cross-resistance with other fluoroquinolones. Increasing inoculum concentrations had minimal effects on WIN 57273 MICs, and the drug was considered to be bactericidal based on reference MBC and kill curve analyses. Unlike most previously studied drugs in this class, WIN 57273 had increased activity (three- to fourfold) at low pH. Rates of mutation to WIN 57273 resistance at eight times its MIC were in the range of 5.6 x 10(-8) to greater than 1.4 x 10(-9). This new compound possesses a wide potential spectrum of use, and it should be evaluated further by in vitro and in vivo studies.\r"

Of 10 mice, 8 survived after a single intravenous (i.v.) injection of 2 mg of gentamicin liposomes per kg compared with 0 of 10 treated with the same amount of free gentamicin. All mice survived after treatment with a single i.v. or intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg of gentamicin liposomes per kg, whereas that dose of free drug was completely ineffective and caused neuromuscular paralysis when injected rapidly i.v. In mice treated with gentamicin liposomes, there was a steady decrease in the number of salmonellae in spleens for 2 weeks after treatment. High concentrations of gentamicin were present in the spleen for at least 10 days after treatment. Although gentamicin was not detected in the mesenteric lymph nodes of mice treated with gentamicin liposomes, bacterial counts in the nodes also decreased over time. Small numbers of bacteria remained viable in the mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches but not in the spleens of mice treated with 20 to 80 mg/kg. Mice treated with doses of gentamicin liposomes as high as 80 mg/kg showed only a transient increase in blood urea nitrogen and no rise in serum creatinine. These results confirm that gentamicin in liposomes is less toxic in mice than is free gentamicin and is extremely effective therapy for disseminated Salmonella infections in mice.\r"

With the use of a semiquantitative measure of regional cortical IMP uptake, the parietal lobes were the most functionally impaired in AD and the most strongly associated with the patients' Blessed Dementia Scale scores. These results indicated that IMP with single photon emission computed tomography may be a useful adjunct in the clinical diagnosis of AD in early, mild disease.\r"

  ".W": "The long-term effects of vasodilators in asymptomatic patients with aortic regurgitation have not been studied extensively. We retrospectively reviewed the echocardiograms of 19 asymptomatic patients with significant aortic regurgitation followed up annually for up to 4 years (average +/- SD, 3.1 +/- 0.7 years). Of these 19 patients, 12 were not receiving vasodilators and 7 were receiving hydralazine hydrochloride, 40 to 200 mg daily. In the patients not receiving vasodilators, left ventricular diastolic and systolic dimensions increased progressively in all patients by an average of 8% and 13%, respectively, after 3 years. In the patients receiving hydralazine, left ventricular dimensions increased by 9% and 5% in the year or more before hydralazine use and decreased by 7% and 7%, respectively, during the first year after using hydralazine. The reduction was observed in all patients during the first year, but an increase was detected in 3 patients followed up beyond that period. The results suggest that the progression of left ventricular dilatation in asymptomatic patients with aortic regurgitation can be delayed by long-term therapy with vasodilators. Pending further confirmation, such therapy may possibly influence the natural history of the disease and delay the timing of operation.\r"

During this 14-year period, the number of discharges more than doubled and the age-adjusted rates increased from 53% to 88% among the four major sex-race groups. On average, nonwhite men experienced annual hospitalization rates 33% higher than white men, while for women the corresponding nonwhite rates were 50% higher. Hospitalization rates during this period remained constant for persons younger than 55 years but rose sharply in the elderly. Concurrently, a slight decline in case fatality rates for an individual hospitalization was seen. The two factors accounting for the growing prevalence of congestive heart failure seem to be the increasing average age of the population and the longer survival of persons with chronic heart disease. The role of improved medical therapy during the period of this study remains uncertain. Increasing demands to provide care for the congestive heart failure syndrome are likely to continue in the coming years, and medical facilities should develop new intervention strategies to treat or prevent the underlying conditions leading to heart failure as well as decrease the need for hospitalization in this common disorder.\r"

While informed consent has become ubiquitous in medical practice, it is not clear to what extent the value of patient autonomy has entered into everyday medical decisions. To evaluate informed consent, we prospectively surveyed 102 outpatients scheduled to undergo a colonoscopy and 16 of their physicians. The colonoscopy examination is straightforward and offers an optimal opportunity for patient participation in decision making. We found that most patients wanted guidance from their physicians and most physicians did not view the patient as autonomous. The more traditional parentalistic model continues to influence the physician-patient relationship, at least for this technical endeavor.\r"

  ".W": "Although diet therapy is considered the cornerstone of therapy for obese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, losing weight is often difficult, and the plasma glucose concentration does not always improve after weight loss. We looked for predictors of improvement in plasma glucose levels after weight loss in 135 obese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who had lost at least 9.1 kg of body weight. After weight loss there was a bimodal distribution of plasma glucose levels, allowing us to identify patients as \"responders\" or \"nonresponders\" according to whether a random plasma glucose level was above or below 10.0 mmol/L after a 9.1-kg weight loss. Fifty-five (41%) of 135 patients were responders (after a 9.1-kg weight loss, the mean +/- SEM plasma glucose level was 7.0 +/- 0.2 mmol/L). Many responders had improved plasma glucose levels after only slight weight loss. Eighty (59%) of 135 patients were nonresponders (after a 9.1-kg weight loss, the mean +/- SEM plasma glucose level was 18.3 +/- 0.6 mmol/L). Although the responder and nonresponder groups were comparable in age, sex distribution, plasma glucose levels, and body weight at initial presentation, improvement in the plasma glucose level after weight loss could be predicted by a plasma glucose level of 10.0 mmol/L or lower after 2.3-kg (62% positive predictive value) and 4.5-kg (79% positive predictive value) weight loss. We conclude that, in contrast to conventional teaching, many patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus will not have any improvement in plasma glucose levels after a 9.1-kg weight loss. However, a substantial minority (approximately 40%) of obese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have much lower plasma glucose levels with a weight loss of 9.1 kg or less. Although the plasma glucose response to weight loss cannot be forecast by initial clinical parameters, the success or failure of diet therapy can be predicted from the plasma glucose level after a weight loss of only 2.3 to 4.5 kg. Mild or moderately obese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who remain hyperglycemic after a weight loss of 2.3 to 9.1 kg are unlikely to improve with further weight loss and should be considered for treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.\r"

In diabetic patients who are incontinent, the underlying problem has been described in the past as urinary retention secondary to autonomic neuropathy. In cystometric studies conducted on 23 elderly diabetic nursing home patients (mean age, 80 years; 19 women, 4 men), who presented with symptoms of urinary dysfunction, involuntary contractions were demonstrated in 61% of the subjects. Thirteen percent of the patients had normal voluntary contractions of the bladder, 17% had voluntary contractions of a low magnitude, and 9% had no contractions at all. The majority (76%) of the subjects presenting with urinary incontinence had involuntary bladder contractions, while all of the subjects presenting with urinary retention had either voluntary contractions of a low magnitude or no contractions. It cannot be assumed that all elderly diabetic patients presenting with urinary symptoms have poorly contracting bladders (diabetic bladder). Urodynamic studies can be helpful when choosing therapy for the elderly diabetic patient with urinary dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Group C beta-hemolytic streptococci cause rare epidemic outbreaks of pharyngitis, but their role in sporadic endemic pharyngitis has been uncertain. We addressed the question of whether non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococci are associated with endemic pharyngitis in two ways. First, we compared rates of isolation from throat swabs of group A, B, C, and G and ungrouped beta-hemolytic streptococci (\"culture negative\") in adult patients vs those rates in controls. Second, we collected in standardized form clinical indexes of patients with pharyngitis: signs and symptoms graded for severity, the examining physician's subjective estimate of the probability of streptococcal pharyngitis, a logistic regression score predicting streptococcal pharyngitis, and whether antibiotic therapy was prescribed. After collecting data and cultures on 1425 patients with sore throats and cultures on 284 controls, we found the following: group C streptococci were isolated significantly more frequently in patients with sore throats than in controls (6% vs 1.4%); four clinical signs and two symptoms distinguished group C-associated pharyngitis as more severe than culture-negative pharyngitis; and six clinical signs and one symptom distinguished group C-associated pharyngitis as less severe than group A pharyngitis. Physicians' subjective estimates, logistic regression scores, and antibiotic treatment all characterized group C-associated pharyngitis as more severe than culture-negative sore throats but less severe than group A pharyngitis. From these data we present the first definitive evidence that group C streptococci are associated with endemic pharyngitis, show that clinical presentation distinguishes a group of patients with group C-associated pharyngitis from populations with culture-negative sore throats and from those with group A pharyngitis. Physicians' response to that presentation merits consideration in the context of rapid group-specific diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis by group A antigen tests.\r"

We report the costs of care to the KPMCP and introduce an innovative application of survival methods to cost analysis. From the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in 1981 to the end of June 1987, 866 cases of AIDS were recorded among members of the KPMCP. Estimates of the costs of care of these patients were derived from comprehensive chart reviews of a random sample of 71 patients whose conditions were diagnosed from January 1984 through June 1987. Total mean lifetime costs per patient were $32,816 (median, $28,677), whereas the mean hospital per diem cost was $20,446 per patient. As more care was shifted to outpatient services overtime, overall costs dropped, despite marked increases in the cost of outpatient medications such as zidovudine. The overall estimate of cost compared closely with other estimates of the cost of care in San Francisco, Calif, and it is lower than estimates from elsewhere in the United States, probably because of the low proportion of cases associated with intravenous drug use and the well-developed social support networks available to patients with AIDS in the San Francisco Bay Area.\r"

Eighty-nine of the elderly admissions (28.2%) were drug related, 36 due to noncompliance (11.4%), and 53 due to adverse drug reactions (16.8%). One hundred three patients had a history of noncompliance (32.7%). Factors statistically associated with a higher risk of hospitalization due to noncompliance were poor recall of medication regimen, seeing numerous physicians, female, medium income category, use of numerous medications, and having the opinion that medications are expensive. Factors associated with an increased risk of an admission due to an adverse drug reaction were use of numerous different medications, higher medication costs, receiving Medicaid, and not receiving any home services. In conclusion, many elderly admissions are drug related; noncompliance accounting for a substantial fraction of these. Elders at high risk of being noncompliant are identifiable using a variety of criteria. Economic factors were important in predicting admissions due to noncompliance as well as adverse drug reactions.\r"

We sought to define racial differences in the cumulative clinical manifestations of SLE in a large, racially balanced cohort (184 black patients and 174 white patients). Differences in the cumulative disease manifestations of SLE between black and white patients were evaluated by multivariate regression techniques, controlling for socioeconomic status and the potential confounding factors of age, gender, duration of follow-up, and treatments. Race was found to be an important factor influencing the prevalence of 9 of 24 clinical features of SLE. As a group, blacks more commonly manifested anti-Sm and anti-RNP antibodies, discoid skin lesions, and proteinuria, and less commonly manifested photosensitivity, than whites. Among specific age, gender, and socioeconomic subgroups, blacks were more likely than whites to have had psychosis, serositis, and urinary cellular casts, and less likely to have had sicca syndrome. Racial differences in the prevalence of renal failure were due to socioeconomic effects. These results suggest that race is under-recognized as a factor influencing the clinical heterogeneity of SLE.\r"

Twenty-five (17%) of these subjects presented with eye disease that required immediate treatment, referral, or accelerated follow-up. Of those indicating they had an ophthalmologist, approximately 35% reported a time since last visit of 2 years or greater.

Two hundred sixty-three (88%) of the medical students surveyed completed the anonymous questionnaire. Tobacco use decreased from 11% before to 4% during medical school. Before entry into medical school, 21% of the respondents had smoked marijuana 10 times or more, usually at least monthly, while 9% had smoked marijuana 10 times or more during medical school. Six percent had smoked marijuana daily in high school or college, while 1% smoked marijuana daily in medical school. Few students who used cocaine before medical school abstained from it during medical school. Cocaine was used by 17% of the respondents before and during medical school. Frequent use of cocaine (greater than 10 times) during medical school, reported by 5% of the students, was directly related to excessive alcohol intake, tobacco dependence, frequent use of marijuana before and during medical school, and medical and behavioral problems related to alcohol and other drug use. Less than 25% of medical schools have a formal policy aimed at identifying impaired students, and only 12% have formal treatment protocols for helping impaired students. We propose that all medical schools initiate programs to diagnose alcohol and other drug-abuse problems in medical student candidates and in the students themselves, and that intervention for any alcohol or other drug problem be encouraged and supported by formal medical school policies designed to help the impaired student.\r"

Each patient had been treated with long-term methotrexate therapy (cumulative doses far in excess of 1.5 g) without undergoing serial liver biopsies, contrary to well-established treatment guidelines. Caution must be exercised in using methotrexate as a steroid-sparing agent in the treatment of inflammatory diseases because of its potential to cause severe hepatotoxic effects with long-term usage and cumulative doses above 1.5 g. Patients easily become psychologically dependent on the drug, and physicians need to guard against the false sense of security engendered by normal results on liver function studies.\r"

Of 155 inpatient rehabilitation admissions after acute unilateral cerebrovascular accident, only 26 met the following strict criteria for inclusion: age older than 55 years, no history of or concomitant brain disease or injury, and no history of major affective, thought, or substance abuse disorder. Two examiners independently administered the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, a mood adjective checklist, and a modified Mini-Mental State Examination to 20 subjects who agreed to participate. They also rated subjects on research diagnostic criteria for depression and obtained a dexamethasone suppression test for each subject. Eighteen subjects completed neuropsychologic evaluation. All evaluations were completed within six weeks of the patient's stroke. Subjects fell into four distinct clinical groups based on averaged data: (1) no affective symptoms, (2) verbal distress only, (3) vegetative symptoms only, and (4) a combined disorder with both distress and vegetative symptoms. The presence of verbal reports of distress, vegetative signs, or both were associated with longer hospital stays and greater neuropsychologic impairment.\r"

At follow-up, 49% had returned to work a mean of 3.1 months after rehabilitation discharge. Factors associated with success and with failure of vocational rehabilitation were then identified, and a predictive model was developed. There were positive associations between return to work and Barthel Index on admission (p = 0.0002) and discharge (p = 0.0015). Negative associations were found between return to work and aphasia (p = 0.0009), rehabilitation length of stay (p less than 0.0001), and prior alcohol consumption (p = 0.03). A step-wise multiple regression model explained 42% of the variance in return to work. Those most likely to return to work were not aphasic; they had shorter rehabilitation lengths of stay and higher Barthel Index scores on discharge; and they were lighter consumers of alcoholic beverages before their strokes. In conclusion, a set of factors predictive of return to work in younger stroke patients was identified, including, most notably, a strong negative association with aphasia and an intriguing negative association with prior alcohol consumption.\r"

TOH is an uncommon entity, most often seen in women during the third trimester of pregnancy and in middle-aged men. It is characterized by groin pain, limited hip range of motion, nonspecific laboratory findings, localized radiographic evidence of osteopenia, and spontaneous recovery usually within two to nine months. Diagnosis remains dependent on clinical recognition and x-ray confirmation. Radioisotope scanning aids in the diagnosis; both bone and synovial biopsies are often less productive. Treatment consists of joint protection with limited weight bearing, range of motion exercise, progressive ambulation, and analgesics. An awareness of TOH facilities appropriate diagnosis and treatment and curtails unnecessary diagnostic procedures.\r"

Values were derived for load transmission through the crutches and for moments at the elbow and shoulder joints. The alternate gait was, on average, 87% faster than the step-to gait, and imposed average loads less than 80% of that in the step-to gait. Peak upper limb joint moments attained values approaching 12Nm at the shoulder joint in both gaits. Given the vulnerability of the upper limb joints in these patients, the load transmission through the upper limb may be unacceptably high in both aided gait patterns.\r"

  ".W": "High-heeled shoes cause postural changes, a loss in foot function, and increased shock loadings during gait, which must be compensated by accommodations in the kinematics of body segments proximal to the feet. The hypothesis tested in this study was that there are differences in the three-dimensional kinematics of the tibia, knee, hip, pelvis, trunk, and upper trunk between low-heeled and high-heeled gait. Gait analysis of 14 subjects showed that during high-heeled gait subjects walked more slowly (p less than .001), had shorter stride lengths (p less than .001), and had higher stance time percentages (p less than .05). Kinematically, high-heeled gait compared to low-heeled gait, was characterized by significantly increased knee flexion at heelstrike (5.4 degrees vs 2.1 degrees, p less than .05) and during stance phase (22.6 degrees vs 19.2 degrees, p less than .05). During swing phase, high-heeled gait, compared to low-heeled gait, resulted in significantly lower knee flexion (66.1 degrees vs 72.1 degrees, p less than .05) and hip flexion (33.5 degrees vs 34.8 degrees, p less than .05). The range of motion of the pelvis in the sagittal plane was slightly lower in high-heeled gait than in low-heeled gait (7.0 degrees vs 7.9 degrees, p less than .05). No significant differences between low-heeled and high-heeled gait were found in the motions of the pelvis and trunk in the frontal and transverse planes. Statistical tests of intrasubject variability of angles of gait showed that five repeated trials were adequate for analysis of the tibia and knee in all planes of motion and for the hip in frontal and transverse planes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An average of five casts for a total duration of four to 64 days were used for each limb. Comparisons of passive dorsiflexion measures before and after casting showed a mean gain of 21 degrees (paired t-test, P less than .05). Of the 18 limbs, 13 reached a passive dorsiflexion of 0 degrees or more (ie, no equinus) which could be maintained without force for at least one hour. The procedures appeared safe and the results of the trial were clinically judged to be favorable. There is a need to further assess the efficacy of serial casting through randomized controlled trials and long-term followups.\r"

Walking conditions for the amputee included using bilateral short-leg (SL) and long-leg (LL) prostheses. A progressive treadmill protocol to maximal capacity was used for the amputee and duplicated by the control subjects. An automated system was used to measure VO2, VE, and HR throughout exercise. Data analysis was restricted to the use of parameter averages and percentages to describe differences between experimental conditions. Maximal VO2 for the amputee averaged 23.3mL/kg-1/min-1 with the LL and 22.8mL/kg-1/min-1 with the SL prostheses, a negligible difference between conditions; however, exercise duration was 27% longer when using the SL prostheses. In addition, when averaged over the first four stages of exercise, VO2, VE, and HR were 24%, 32%, and 14% higher, respectively, when the LL prostheses were used. Treadmill walking by unimpaired controls averaged 47% and 79% more economical than walking with the SL or LL prostheses, respectively. These results demonstrate that the use of currently available AK prostheses requires significant energy expenditure, which limits their use to only the most physically fit individuals.\r"

Twelve MR adults performed maximal exercise tests to volitional exhaustion, on separate days, on the SAE and TM. Maximal heart rates, oxygen consumption, minute ventilation, and respiratory quotient were similar for both exercise tests. These results indicate that the SAE is comparable to TM exercise in assessing the cardiovascular capacity of MR adults.\r"

Men who had a myocardial infarction were randomly assigned to four exercise programs: The first program consisted of purely hospital-based exercise. The second and third programs combined hospital and home exercise, including either bicycling or walking at home. In the fourth program, patients were encouraged to exercise at home, but were given no specific guidance. Fifty-two patients finished the eight-week exercise program and 35 completed the psychologic questionnaires. At the end of the eight weeks, there were significant differences in the programs' effects on aerobic fitness. Purely hospital-supervised exercise and the combination of hospital-supervised bicycling with home walking increased aerobic fitness more than completely unsupervised exercise. Furthermore, there were differences in the programs' effects on manifest anxiety. The combination of home and hospital bicycling was less beneficial than home walking and hospital bicycling or even completely unsupervised exercise at home. The results indicate that the degree of hospital supervision and the type of prescribed home exercise are important design features which may affect the success of cardiac rehabilitation exercise programs. No effects of the different exercise programs on patients' depression could be found. In general, a close relationship between aerobic fitness and anxiety or depression could not be demonstrated. Implications of these findings for the design of cardiac rehabilitation exercise programs are discussed.\r"

A unique characteristic of the FIM, as compared with other functional scales, is that it reflects abilities in the areas of communication and social cognition. In order to examine the external validity of these subscales, 41 acute SCI patients were evaluated with the FIM just before discharge from acute rehabilitation. The subscale scores were compared to the results of a comprehensive, predominantly motor-free, neuropsychologic battery administered 74.8 +/- 5.3 days postinjury. Evaluation of scatter plots indicated that there were no relationships between any neuropsychologic test results and the discharge FIM social cognition or communication subscale scores. This was attributed to a ceiling effect in the FIM ratings. The results of this study suggest that the FIM cannot be a substitute for comprehensive neuropsychologic assessment in SCI patients.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine in 17 stroke patients the correlation between two independent variables (knee extensor muscle torque [KET] and spasticity on the paretic side) and one dependent variable (gait speed). The patients had a mean age of 59 years; time since onset of first stroke was 51 days. Each variable was measured twice on each of two consecutive days. Both KET and spasticity were measured on a Cybex II dynamometer. Peak torque was measured during five-second maximal voluntary isometric knee extension efforts. Spasticity was defined by the relative angle of reversal (RAR) of the Cybex electrogoniometer curve obtained during pendulum tests. Gait speed was measured as patients walked 8.0 meters at their most comfortable speed while using their usual devices. The average of each day's KETs, RARs, and gait speeds was used in the calculation of Pearson product moment correlations. The correlations between KET and gait speed were significant (p less than .05) and were .574 (day 1) and .571 (day 2). The correlations between the RAR and gait speed were not significant (-.204 day 1 and -.262 day 2). All measurements had intraday and/or interday reliability coefficients (ICC 3,1) exceeding .930. The results of this study confirm that gait performance is correlated with measures of KET but not spasticity in stroke patients. Thus, at the knee, extensor muscle torque, unlike spasticity, appears to be justified as a practical and objective clinical measure.\r"

These values were measured both eccentrically and concentrically for each of the joint movements tested, using a Kin/Com isokinetic dynamometer. The peak torque values for the knee joint were found to be substantially larger than those reported for nonathletes, and comparable to those for other athletic populations. No comparable scores were located for the results of the hip and ankle scores. The flexion and extension ratios for the knee joint, at approximately .60, were similar to others reported, whereas the ratios for the hip joint were larger at .76. The concentric and eccentric ratios varied, depending on the speed of testing and the joint tested.\r"

An alternative hypothesis is offered; that is, a similar dysfunction of the SMA could be the result of altered sensory information from a painful limb disturbing the crucial integration between sensory input and motor performance. The following three examples of such integration are provided: (1) the long loop or transcortical reflex, (2) input of distinctive somatosensory neurons to the SMA, and (3) the projection of proprioceptive and tactile sensory input into peripheral receptive fields of the motor cortex.\r"

I have described these hypotheses using B27 and AS, and DR4 and RA. We are all aware that AS occurs in individuals who are B27 negative, and RA occurs in individuals who lack DR4. Although space does not permit further elaboration here, these hypotheses can be modified to take these additional associations into account. It should also be noted that even if the mechanisms advanced in these hypotheses prove to be true, different mechanisms may apply to different diseases, and several of these mechanisms may act in concert to produce disease. Nevertheless, these hypotheses provide a framework against which future experiments can be designed to further elucidate the relationship among infectious agents, immunity, and rheumatic diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic disease characterized by the destructive proliferation of synovial tissue. It has been suggested that this proliferative lesion resembles a malignancy. Although polypeptide growth factors have been implicated in malignant cell growth, their role in the pathogenesis of proliferative but non-neoplastic diseases such as RA has not been extensively studied. We tested the hypothesis that the synoviocyte itself may be a source of growth factor activity. We demonstrated that culture supernatants from synoviocytes obtained from patients with RA, osteoarthritis, and traumatic joint disease contain mitogenic activity. This activity has biologic properties identical to those of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Specifically, the mitogenic activity is synergistic with insulin and binds to heparin-agarose, but elutes with 2.0M NaCl. In addition, synoviocyte extracts contain a peptide with a molecular weight of approximately 16,000, which reacts with antibody specific for bFGF. Cultured synoviocytes express the bFGF gene, express receptors for bFGF, and proliferate in response to bFGF. We conclude that bFGF derived from the synoviocytes themselves may play a role in stimulating their proliferation in an autocrine manner in disease states such as RA.\r"

  ".W": "We describe 2 patients with rapidly progressing systemic sclerosis that did not respond to conventional therapy, who were treated with a 5-day regimen of T cell-specific antilymphocyte globulin. One patient had deteriorating pulmonary involvement, and the second patient had developed disabling skin disease with multiple ulcers and gangrene. Both patients showed improvement concomitant with almost complete elimination of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Regeneration of peripheral T cells required 60-90 days and was followed by a long-term inversion of the CD4:CD8 ratio. The persistent therapeutic effect in both patients correlated with the lack of CD4+ T cells and the predominance of CD8+ T cells. This suggests a crucial role of T cell immunity in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis. In vitro studies of regenerating T cells demonstrated that CD4+ helper/inducer cells were functionally competent. Alterations in the composition of the CD8+ population may explain the prolonged suppression of CD4+ T cells observed during the period of therapeutic benefit.\r"

At each biennial examination (1963-1981), the women were asked about their use of estrogen during the previous 2 years. We categorized estrogen use as no use reported, use reported at 1 examination, or use reported at 2 or more examinations. We found no positive association of estrogen use with radiographic knee osteoarthritis after controlling for age, body mass index, age at menopause, physical activity, history of knee injury, and smoking. In fact, a modest but nonsignificant protective effect for both radiographic osteoarthritis (odds ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.42, 1.20) and severe radiographic osteoarthritis (odds ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.33, 1.32) was seen in women who reported estrogen use at 2 or more examinations. Subgroup analyses also showed no association between estrogen use and radiographic knee osteoarthritis. We conclude that estrogen use in women is not associated with an increased risk of radiographic knee osteoarthritis.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on human articular cartilage and chondrocytes in culture. Both TNF alpha and TNF beta stimulated cartilage matrix breakdown during prolonged culture and elevated the levels of plasminogen activator (PA) activity in both the supernatants and cell layers of cultured chondrocytes. Characterization of the PA activities by immunochemistry and by zymography following gel electrophoresis indicated that human chondrocytes produce both urokinase-type PA and tissue-type PA in response to TNF. The addition of both interleukin-1 and TNF alpha or TNF beta to chondrocyte cultures demonstrated a synergism between these cytokines in the generation of PA activity in the culture supernatants and cell layers. Our results suggest that both activated lymphocytes and monocytes may contribute to the cartilage destruction of inflammatory arthritis through their stimulation of chondrocytes with TNF beta and TNF alpha, respectively. Since PA is the only neutral proteinase reported to be elevated in TNF-stimulated chondrocyte cultures, it could have an important role in TNF-mediated cartilage destruction.\r"

  ".W": "The kinetics of appearance and specificity of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies was studied in four individuals. HIV-1 was isolated during symptomatic primary HIV-1 infection and repeatedly thereafter, and tested against autologous sera collected in parallel. Our patients developed isolate-specific low-titer neutralizing antibodies within 2-4 weeks, and the titers to the first isolates increased with time. We documented the emergence of virus variants with reduced sensitivity to neutralization by autologous, but not heterologous, sera in three patients. These virus variants were not, however, resistant to neutralization per se, since they were readily neutralized by the positive control serum. Our patients did not develop antibodies capable of neutralizing the new virus variants during the observation period. This suggests either a failure of the immune system to respond to the new virus variants or a mechanism by which the virus evades detection by the immune system. The emergence of neutralization-resistant virus variants was not directly correlated with disease progression since two patients have remained asymptomatic after the emergence of such virus variants. It is, however, likely that the emergence of virus variants which the patient fails to neutralize in the long run contributes to disease progression.\r"

Ninety-seven sera from HIV-infected people at all stages of disease were examined for the presence of anti-idiotypic antibodies to three anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies. None were found. The same sera were screened for antibodies reactive with soluble CD4, and five (5.2%) were positive.

Eleven people had measurable IFN alpha levels ranging from 1 to 40 IU/ml. None of the sera tested was positive for IFN alpha binding or IFN alpha neutralizing antibodies in the assays employed. Twenty-five of the 26 people had significant levels of the Mx-homologous protein in their peripheral mononuclear cells. The Mx concentrations varied from 0.3 to 6 U/ml in the people studied. IFN alpha-positive people had significantly higher levels of the Mx homolog than IFN alpha-negative people (P less than 0.03). Furthermore, the Mx homolog content in Walter-Reed class 2 people was significantly lower than in Walter-Reed class 5/6 people (P less than 0.01). Our results suggest that the IFN system is activated in more than 90% of the people with lymphadenopathy-associated syndrome, AIDS-related complex and AIDS. Since acid-labile IFN alpha can induce the Mx homolog in vitro endogenously produced IFN alpha seems likely to be responsible for the high Mx homolog levels detected.\r"

Sixty-two per cent of the women were seropositive for HIV infection at enrollment. Significant associations were found between HIV seropositivity and Tanzanian origin (OR = 2.12, CI 95% = 1.18-3.81, P less than 0.03), younger age, a shorter duration of prostitution, reduced fecundity, use of oral contraceptives (OR = 1.8, CI 95% = 1.1-2.9, P less than 0.05) and genital ulcer disease (OR = 3.32, P less than 0.00001). No associations were noted with other STD. Stepwise logistic regression analysis confirmed independent associations between HIV infection and Tanzanian origin (OR = 2.27, CI 95% = 1.25-4.14, P less than 0.007), reduced fecundity (OR = 0.83, CI 95% = 0.74-0.94, P less than 0.003), oral contraceptive use (OR = 2.02, CI 95% = 1.22-3.35, P less than 0.006) and duration of prostitution (OR = 0.39, CI 95% = 0.23-0.65, P less than 0.004). Oral contraceptives may increase susceptibility to HIV or may be a marker for other factors which increase risk of acquisition. Further studies are necessary to confirm this association.\r"

The 179 seronegatives reported one or more HIV risk behaviors: homosexual intercourse (n = 111), heterosexual intercourse with possibly infected partners (n = 62), intravenous drug use (n = 20). Immediately after notification, seronegatives had significant decreases in visual analogue scale (VAS) measures of anxiety, depression, fear of getting AIDS, and fear of having infected others. Reductions were sustained at both follow-up assessments and were complemented by significant reductions on standardized self-reported measures of anxiety (Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, SAI), depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI), and psychiatric symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory, BSI) as well as by clinical ratings of depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, HDRS). Of 39 seropositives, 35 had homosexual risk behaviors, seven had been intravenous drug users (IVDUs; four of whom were homosexual men), and one was a female partner of an IVDU. Immediately after notification, VAS measures of their anxiety were not significantly increased, and at 10 weeks after notification, their VAS measures of distress and mean scores on BDI, SAI and BSI were significantly lower than at entry. Their HDRS ratings were not significantly increased.\r"

However, we are unaware of previous experimental or clinical reports of segmental mandibular regeneration by distraction osteogenesis. In a canine model, 2.5-cm segmental mandibular defects were filled with regenerate bone in 25 days at a rate of 1.0 mm/d using bifocal distraction osteogenesis. The diameters of the regenerate segments were comparable with preexisting mandible, and all animals resumed normal oromandibular function following regeneration. The regenerate bone was evaluated radiographically, angiographically, and histologically. In the control group without distraction osteogenesis, the segmental defects failed to fill with regenerate bone. The theoretical basis for distraction osteogenesis, a detailed description of the technique, and a review of previous studies on experimental mandibular lengthening are presented.\r"

Materials evaluated include porous polytetrafluoroethylene carbon (Proplast), large-pore high-density polyethylene (Medpor), solid medical-grade silicone rubber (Silastic), polyamide mesh (Supramid), and autogenous rib bone. The subjects were 12 mixed-breed dogs and the materials were implanted directly on bone with periosteum removed at one of three sites in the dog's face (malar eminence, nasal dorsum, and chin). Animals were killed 3 months after surgery and stability of the implants was graded by manual manipulation. Blocks of tissue, including the study materials and underlying bone, were examined microscopically after sectioning. Stability results are tabulated and histologic appearance is described by site for each material evaluated. These data demonstrate marked variability of stability and cellular response depending on the site of implantation. From these data one may conclude that the site of implantation and implant movement are essential factors in determining the nature of the tissue response and fate of an implant. Solid and porous alloplastic materials show an acceptable tissue response, but neither demonstrates the ability to consistently provide an implant that is stable on underlying bone.\r"

The tensor tympanic fold is fused with the superior mallear fold in type C, the best-developed type (18%), with the recess being contiguous with the eustachian tube. The shape of the anterior epitympanic recess is influenced by the ratio between the cavities above and below the tensor tympanic fold, ie, by the embryologic development of the saccus anticus and the anterior saccule of the saccus medius.

Results were obtained from a total of more than 1400 patients, including adults, adolescents, and children.

Chest roentgenograms taken on the first postoperative day were scored for atelectasis by preestablished criteria. Sixty-five percent of control and 70% of flap patients demonstrated postoperative atelectasis roentgenographically. The flap patients with skin paddles larger than 40 cm2 had a 60% incidence of major atelectasis compared with 5% in control patients. The skin island area was strongly correlated with the atelectasis score in the flap group. These results suggest that atelectasis is common following pectoralis major myocutaneous flap reconstruction of head and neck defects. As well, decreased chest wall compliance after primary closure of large donor defects may contribute to the atelectasis observed.\r"

  ".W": "The association between catastrophic airway events and developmental delay was examined in patients with CHARGE (coloboma, heart disease, atresia choanae, retarded growth and/or development, genital hypoplasia, and ear anomalies and/or deafness) association. A retrospective chart analysis was performed from The Children's Hospital in Boston, Mass. Sixteen patients were identified with CHARGE association. Nine patients had at least one respiratory arrest, and 7 had no airway difficulties. Some degree of developmental delay was seen in 14 patients, but was most severe in those patients who suffered a respiratory arrest. We conclude that children with CHARGE association have a propensity for airway instability and that cerebral hypoxia contributed to the developmental delay in some of our patients. We recommend early tracheotomy rather than early choanal atresia repair in these patients to protect the central nervous system.\r"

Extension of antral carcinoma into the infratemporal and pterygopalatine fossae decreases the probability of achieving an all-encompassing resection via the classic anterolateral Weber-Fergusson approach because of limited posterior access. Temporal and lateral infratemporal fossa approaches have been described and involve either mobilization of the zygomatic arch or a lateral mandibular osteotomy, respectively. We report the use of a median labiomandibulotomy combined with the Weber-Fergusson approach for lesions extending posteriorly. The labiomandibulotomy with paralingual extension along the floor of the mouth allows rotation of the coronoid process laterally and exposes the infratemporal fossa to its posterior margin. We present two cases in which this approach was used to extirpate lesions that had extended posteriorly. Relevant anatomy, operative technique, potential complications, and limitations, as well as a comparison with other methods of exposure, are discussed.\r"

The sCD4 produced by the viral vectors is immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibodies against CD4, which specifically block human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of helper/inducer T cells. A direct physical interaction of vector-produced sCD4 and HIV-1 gp120 was demonstrated by coprecipitation of sCD4/gp120 with antiserum directed against HIV gp120. Furthermore, transduced cells producing sCD4 can protect HIV-susceptible cells from infection by HIV. These data suggest that gene therapy is a potential approach for the treatment of AIDS.\r"

Effects of the immunotoxins produced against infected cells were evaluated. Selective inhibition of the proliferation and killing of chronically HIV infected cells were observed in the presence of the immunotoxins. To determine the feasibility of the immunotoxins against the infected cells in seropositive subjects, we attempted to detect gp120-bearing cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) by cytofluorography. Cells in the monocyte/macrophage region of 2 of 10 PBM samples from HIV-infected individuals were found to react with 0.5 beta (18.1% and 12.8%). Furthermore, the cell population which was reactive with 0.5 beta was also susceptible to RAC conjugated with 0.5 beta. These results suggest that the strategy of using anti-gp120 immunotoxin to eliminate HIV-infected cells may be feasible in infected individuals.\r"

Half-life, total clearance, and steady-state volume of distribution were similar for both compounds. The observed pharmacokinetic parameters for AZT were comparable to those previously reported in humans. Oral absorption of AzddU and AZT was virtually complete after 60 mg/kg. However, bioavailability of both nucleosides was markedly lower (less than 50%) after 200 mg/kg, possibly indicating the involvement of a saturable absorption mechanism. The nucleosides were also well absorbed after subcutaneous administration. AzddU and AZT penetrated the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with concentration ratios in CSF:serum ranging from 0.05 to 0.25 one hour after drug administration. The glucuronides of AZT and AzddU were readily detected in urine. Hemogram and blood chemistry values for animals receiving short-term treatment (3 doses) with either AZT or AzddU did not exhibit any significant changes when compared with untreated control monkeys. The similar pharmacokinetic characteristics of AzddU compared with AZT suggest that clinical trials of AzddU are warranted.\r"

In this study, we present evidence that when HSV-1 stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) are cocultured with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the generation of CD4+, DR-restricted CTL during the 5-day culture period is inhibited. In contrast, HIV-1 had no effect on either natural killer (NK) activity, or on the unrestricted NK-like killers which are often detected in HSV-1-stimulated cultures after the depletion of CD16+ cells. HIV-1 also failed to inhibit the generation of CTL against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a response that principally involves CD8+, CD4-, class I-restricted killers.\r"

A platelet count below 100 X 10(9)/liter was detected in 72 patients (10.9%). Compared with anti-HIV-positive controls with normal platelets, a significantly higher prevalence of males (p less than 0.02) and of intravenous drug abusers (p less than 0.02) as well as a higher frequency of patients with advanced HIV-related disease (p less than 0.001) were detected among thrombocytopenic patients. Those patients whose thrombocytopenia was associated with neutropenia and/or anemia (14 cases, 2.1%) clearly differed from patients with isolated thrombocytopenia (IT) (58 cases, 8.8%) since they belonged to the more advanced groups of the CDC classification of HIV-related disorders, had lower CD4-positive lymphocyte counts, a higher frequency of cutaneous anergy, and less persistent thrombocytopenia. In the cohort of patients with persistent IT (47 cases), no single epidemiological or clinical data proved to correlate with the severity of thrombocytopenia. They did not differ significantly from anti-HIV-positive controls in their distribution among CDC groups, but the total lymphocyte and the CD4-positive lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in IT patients belonging to CDC group II (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.02, respectively) and III (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.005, respectively) compared with CDC group-matched controls; after a median followup of one year, the two cohorts showed similar rates of progression to CDC Group IV.\r"

No therapeutic regimen has yet been shown to improve the prognosis of patients with silent ischaemia after infarction, which can be found in as many as a third of these patients. Attempts to achieve therapeutic revascularisation in all these patients may be undesirable, but early revascularisation could be especially beneficial in some selected high risk patients. Two hundred and fifty consecutive clinically stable survivors of myocardial infarction who had predischarge submaximal exercise tests were followed up for a year. Silent ischaemia was found in 27% of these patients; 15% had symptomatic ischaemia. Patients with a positive exercise test were prescribed a beta blocker before discharge. Mortality in patients with silent (9.4%) and symptomatic (5.4%) ischaemia in the first year after infarction was not significantly different. Patients with symptomatic ischaemia were more likely to have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting in the first year. Patients with silent ischaemia were, however, significantly more likely to die than patients with a negative exercise test (relative odds 12:1). Patients with silent ischaemia and an abnormal blood pressure response or who could not complete a submaximal exercise protocol were at particularly high risk, being 32 times more likely to die than those with a negative test (95% confidence interval from 3.3 to 307 times more likely). First year mortality in this group was 22%. The benefits of therapeutic revascularisation in this high risk group need to be studied.\r"

There were no significant differences in the exercise test characteristics between the two groups, and in those 149 patients in whom angiography was performed triple vessel disease was present in 36/114 (32%) of the Q wave group and 9/35 (26%) of the non Q wave group. The infarct related artery was more often patent in the non Q wave group (27/35 (77%] than in the Q wave group (53/114 (46%]. The one year mortality and the reinfarction and angina rates were similar in the two groups and the exercise test remained a good discriminator for predicting patients at risk of future cardiac events in both groups. In view of the similar outcome and severity of coronary disease in those aged less than or equal to 70 with non Q wave infarcts, the distinction between Q and non Q wave infarction need not influence management decisions in patients after myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was analysed continuously before and for 24 h after lower abdominal surgery in 30 patients breathing air using one of three postoperative analgesic regimens: i.v. diamorphine using a patient-controlled analgesia system (PCAS), extradural diamorphine or i.m. morphine. Hypoxaemia was defined as SaO2 less than 94% for more than 6 min h-1. Before operation there was no difference between the three analgesia groups assessed by the duration when SaO2 was less than 94%. After operation the pattern of SaO2 vs time distribution was either stable, with little variation from hour to hour with no hypoxaemia, or unstable with large variation with 30% of patients hypoxaemic. Thus three patterns of SaO2 distribution were seen in the postoperative period: stable without hypoxaemia (4/10 PCAS, 0/10 extradural, and 1/10 i.m. patients), unstable without hypoxaemia (4/10 PCAS, 5/10 extradural and 7/10 i.m. patients) and unstable with prolonged nocturnal periods with SaO2 less than 94% for a mean of 17.7 min h-1, 95% confidence limits (CL) 10-25 min h-1, (2/10 PCAS, 2/10 i.m. and 5/10 extradural patients). Before operation, the unstable group with hypoxaemia spent longer at less than 94% SaO2 (mean 4.8 min h-1, 95% CL 1.0-8.6 min h-1) than the stable group (mean 0.4 min h-1, 95% CL 0.17-0.61 min h-1) and this was a predictor of postoperative hypoxaemia. Hypoxaemia occurred in all analgesia groups, but extradural diamorphine tended to cause longer periods. Some patients at risk of postoperative hypoxaemia may be predicted by preoperative monitoring of SaO2 although extradural diamorphine boluses were associated with hypoxaemia in patients with normal preoperative values.\r"

A single i.v. dose of 0.3 mg was given to 15 patients (nine with dialysis-dependent renal failure) undergoing lower abdominal or peripheral body surface surgery. Blood was sampled up to 24 h. Concentrations of buprenorphine, B3G and NorB were assayed by a differential radioimmunoassay technique. There were no differences in buprenorphine kinetics between anaesthetized healthy patients and those with renal impairment: mean elimination half-lives 398 and 239 min; clearance 651 and 988 ml min-1; apparent volume of distribution at steady state 313 and 201 litre, respectively. Both metabolites were undetectable following the single i.v. dose. In a second group of 20 patients (eight with renal impairment), buprenorphine was administered by continuous infusion for provision of analgesia and control of ventilation in the ITU (median infusion rate 161 micrograms h-1 (range 36-230 micrograms h-1) for a median duration of 30 h (2-565 h). Buprenorphine clearance in patients with normal and impaired renal function was similar (934 and 1102 ml min-1, respectively), as were dose-corrected plasma concentrations of buprenorphine. In patients with renal failure, plasma concentrations of NorB were increased by a median of four times, and B3G concentrations by a median of 15 times.\r"

In Phase 2 the data acquired from Phase 1 were used in an attempt to produce a predetermined degree of neuromuscular block. The aim was a block of neuromuscular function so that the height of the first twitch of a train-of-four was 15% of control. In the 10 patients studied the average height was 14.7% (SD 4.95%).

One hundred ASA Physical Status I or II patients (four groups of 25), selected randomly and undergoing elective surgery, received atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1, with thiopentone, nitrous oxide and enflurane. Supplementary doses of fentanyl were given if needed. Train-of-four (TOF) stimulation was applied every 12 s, and the force of contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle was recorded. When first twitch height (T1) had recovered spontaneously to 10% of initial value, edrophonium 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 or 1 mg kg-1 was administered by random allocation. Enflurane concentrations remained constant, except that enflurane was discontinued in 50% of the patients who had received 2% enflurane. Monitoring was continued for at least 10 min, at which time T1 and TOF ratio (T4/T1) were measured.

Measurements of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were made either by measuring inspired and expired ventilation and gas fractions in these volumes or by measuring gas fractions and calculating expired ventilation from inspired by transformation (Haldane). Irrespective of the FIO2, measured values correlated well with lung model settings: measured values were within +/- 2% of simulated. When Haldane transformation was used with an FIO2 of 0.5 there was a significant underestimation of oxygen consumption. Carbon dioxide production values correlated well irrespective of the FIO2 used or method of measurement of ventilation volume. Metabolic gas exchange measurements by measuring both inspired and expired ventilation volumes may be used when inert gases are not in equilibrium, for example during nitrous oxide anaesthesia.\r"

The area of the LV cavity seen in the short axis images at a mid-papillary muscle level at end-systole (ESA) and end-diastole (EDA) were compared with volumes measured by RNA at end-systole (ESV) and end-diastole (EDV). An area ejection fraction (AEF) calculated from the TOE images (AEF = EDA-ESA/EDA) was compared with the RNA ejection fraction (EF) where EF = EDV-ESV/EDV. Good correlations were found between TOE log EDA and RNA log EDV (r = 0.86), TOE log ESA and RNA log ESV (r = 0.92) and TOE AEF and RNA EF (r = 0.96). This suggests that TOE short axis imaging at a mid-papillary muscle level is generally adequate for monitoring LV function during operation.\r"

The count reached a level approximately twofold or more above the preinjection level even at 5 micrograms/kg/d, and at doses of more than 20 micrograms/kg/d, the increase became biphasic with a higher second peak 3 days after cessation of the injections. Morphologic analysis of the bone marrow after the 7 day-injections with 80 micrograms/kg/d revealed a marked increment in size of megakaryocytes compared with control, indicating the promotion of megakaryocyte maturation. Other changes attributable to the rhIL-6 treatment include dose-dependent loss of body weight, anemia, neutrophilia and monocytosis, elevation of serum C-reactive protein and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein levels, and decrease of serum albumin; all of which returned to normal within 1 week after cessation of the injections and were tolerable at doses of less than 10 micrograms/kg/d. These findings suggest that rhIL-6 may be an effective strategy for the treatment of thrombocytopenia.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed data from 263 patients with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) autografted in first remission (CR) during the period from January, 1982 to January, 1987 at one of 34 centers in the European Bone Marrow Transplant Group. The median age of patients was 30 years (range, 1 to 65). The median interval between achieving CR and autografting was 5 months (range, 1 to 23). Of the 263 patients, 131 patients received cytoreductive regimens that included total body irradiation (TBI); the remainder received various combinations of cytotoxic drugs. Sixty-nine patients received autologous marrow purged in vitro with mafosfamide, and 194 received unpurged marrow. The median follow-up was 28 months (range, 12 to 97). For patients with standard risk AML in CR1 autografted after TBI (n = 107), the leukemia-free survival (LFS) was higher, and the probability of relapse was lower in recipients of purged than of unpurged marrow (63% versus 34%, P = .05 and 23% versus 55%, relative risk 0.34, P = .005, respectively). The superior results of purging were most obvious in patients autografted within 6 months of achieving CR (probability of relapse, 20% versus 61%, P = .01). Patients with longer intervals between CR and autografting had higher LFS and lower probability of relapse than those autografted early in CR (intervals greater than 9 months, 7 to 9 months, 4 to 7 months, and less than or equal to 3 months: LFS = 56%, 40%, 35%, 27%, P = .007, probability of relapse = 25%, 56%, 59%, 67%, P = .005; respectively). We conclude that marrow purging with mafosfamide may be valuable for patients autografted early in first CR.\r"

  ".U": "90227230\r", 
  ".W": "We examined erythropoietin receptor expression in two murine cell lines, B6SUtA and DA-1, that respond to erythropoietin in different ways. While B6SUtA cells undergo erythroid differentiation with limited proliferation after addition of erythropoietin, DA-1 cells show only a proliferative response. Equilibrium binding experiments with 125I-erythropoietin revealed that both B6SUtA and DA-1 cells express a single class of erythropoietin receptors. In the absence of erythropoietin, B6SUtA cells exhibited 145 receptors per cell with a dissociation constant (kd) of 380 pmol/L. Six days after induction with erythropoietin, the B6SUtA cells displayed 310 receptors per cell without a change in binding affinity; exposure to erythropoietin also increased cellular hemoglobin content. DA-1 cells adapted to erythropoietin-dependent growth over a period of months and exhibited a progressive increase in erythropoietin receptor expression, from 85 per cell (kd = 540) to 550 per cell (kd = 530), although the cells remained uniformly benzidine-negative. We interpret the data with B6SUtA cells to indicate that early erythroid differentiation stages are attended by an increase in erythropoietin receptor display, coordinate with the initiation of expression of erythroid-specific genes. In contrast, the results with DA-1 cells are most compatible with clonal selection as the mechanism underlying enhanced receptor expression. Thus, display of the erythropoietin receptor is dynamic and can be modulated during the course of erythropoietin-induced differentiation.\r"

We previously reported that mature dermal mast cells developed locally in the skin of W/Wv, but not Sl/Sld, mice at sites of chronic idiopathic dermatitis. We now report that the repeated application of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to the ear skin of either W/Wv or +/+ mice induces both dermatitis and a striking and dose-dependent increase in the number of dermal mast cells. The number of dermal mast cells at sites treated for 6 weeks with 5 micrograms PMA, three times per week, was 39 +/- 7/mm2 and 305 +/- 34/mm2 for W/Wv and +/+ mice, respectively; the corresponding values for vehicle-treated skin were 1.5 +/- 1.0/mm2 and 145 +/- 8/mm2, respectively. The PMA-induced dermal mast cells in W/Wv mice appeared mature by morphology, stained with the heparin-binding fluorescent dye, berberine sulfate, and were competent to express IgE-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis responses. The development of mast cells was a local, not systemic, effect of PMA treatment. PMA treatment also induced dermatitis in both WCB6F1-Sl/Sld and +/+ mice, but was associated with increased numbers of dermal mast cells only in the WCB6F1(-)+/+ mice. PMA treatment had no detectable effect on the ability of bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells to survive in the skin of Sl/Sld mice. These findings establish a convenient model system for analyzing factors associated with the development of endogenous populations of mast cells in genetically mast cell-deficient W/Wv mice.\r"

  ".W": "The recognition of replicating hepatitis B virus (HBV) may be important to both define the cause of and know how to manage chronic liver disease in multitransfused hemophilic patients. Replicating HBV can be detected at the molecular level by methods for HBV-specific DNA (HBV-DNA), which are much more sensitive than the immunologic methods for detecting hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Unselected hemophilic patients (260; 6% with HBsAg, 4% with isolated anti-hepatitis B core (anti-HBc), 52% with anti-HBs and anti-HBc, 26% with isolated anti-HBs, and 12% with no HBV marker) were investigated retrospectively with a dot spot hybridization technique that detects serum HBV-DNA down to 0.5 pg and by Southern blot analysis, which tests the specificity of the HBV-DNA reactions. Eighteen patients (7%; five with serum HBsAg and 13 HBsAg seronegative with antibodies to HBV) had serum HBV-DNA. Serum HBV-DNA was detected more frequently in HBsAg carriers than in seronegative patients (33% versus 6%, P less than .01), and had no relationship to serum alanine aminotransferase. Serum HBV-DNA was more sensitive than the radioimmunoassay for HBeAg was for detecting replicating HBV (7% versus 1.1%, P less than .01). These findings demonstrate that there is cryptic HBV infection in a number of hemophiliacs and that serum HBV-DNA may coexist with markers thought to reflect immunity against HBV.\r"

Reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the lysyl endopeptidase digest of the purified gamma-chains of fibrinogen Baltimore III revealed the presence of a peptide that is not found in the digest of the normal fibrinogen gamma-chain. Amino acid sequence analysis of this peptide indicated that the gamma-chain residue 308, asparagine, is replaced by isoleucine. Concanavalin A bound both normal and variant gamma-chains of fibrinogen Baltimore III, indicating that the carbohydrate moiety is not altered and is not responsible for the increase in electrophoretic mobility of the Baltimore III gamma-chain. This study suggests that the integrity of gamma Asn308 is critical for fibrin monomer polymerization, since alteration to either a basic (fibrinogen Kyoto I, Asn----Lys) or hydrophobic (Asn----Ile) residue results in significantly delayed polymerization of fibrinogen to fibrin.\r"

Additional numerical chromosomal changes were a trisomy 8 or 17 in two cases each and a trisomy 19 in one case. Five patients had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) diagnosed according to the FAB nomenclature as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) in two cases, refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEBt) in two cases, and refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) in one case. One patient suffered from a myeloproliferative disorder (MPS). All cases progressed to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) type M1, M2, or M4 in a period of 2 to 30 months after initial diagnosis, except one patient with RAEBt who died within 2 months. Two patients presented with ANLL-M2 at time of diagnosis. Treatment during the chronic phase of disease consisted of mild cytoreduction and/or substitution of platelets or red blood cells. One patient with CMML received an allogeneic bone marrow graft and relapsed after 33 months with ANLL-M1. Treatment results for overt leukemia were poor, and survival was short, lasting from 1 to 4 months. Overall survival was 1 to 37 months (median duration, 6.5 months). Molecular studies in two cases revealed neither a BCR rearrangement nor a translocation of the ABL protooncogene, as observed in Ph1-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Thus, an i(17q) anomaly seems to identify a distinct subgroup of mostly myelodysplastic and, less frequently, myeloproliferative disorders that progress rapidly to ANLL, respond poorly to chemotherapy, and are associated with short survival after transformation.\r"

  ".U": "90227241\r", 
  ".W": "We describe a white French family in which 12 subjects presented with hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) or hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP). Eight of these subjects were shown to be heterozygous for a spectrin (Sp) alpha I/74 variant, as demonstrated by analysis of partial tryptic digestion fragments of spectrin. This abnormal peptide pattern was associated with a decreased ability of Sp dimers to self-associate. In this kindred, in which four generations were available for study, the clinical expression varied from mild HE to HPP with an intermediate status of hemolytic HE. The severity of the disease appeared to be correlated both with the estimated amount of variant Sp (42% to 65%) and the excess of Sp dimers found in the membrane (30% to 51%, with a normal value of 3.7% +/- 1.6%). Reassociation studies using isolated Sp alpha and beta chains from an affected patient and an unaffected control subject showed that the Sp alpha I/74 Kd abnormal tryptic peptide resulted from a defect in the Sp alpha chain. Partial amino acid sequencing showed that the Sp alpha I/74 Kd peptide resulted from cleavage at lysine residue 42 of the Sp alpha I/80 Kd domain. Knowledge of the exon/intron organization of the human alpha Sp gene allowed us to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction the second exon of the alpha Sp gene in total cellular DNA of the HPP proposita. The amplified fragment was subcloned and sequenced. We found a G to A base substitution in the 22nd codon (CAT for CGT), which changes the normal arginine to a histidine. Hybridization of amplified DNAs with allele-specific oligonucleotides corresponding to the normal and mutant sequences confirmed the presence of the mutation in six other HE and HPP members of the family. The identification of this mutation at the DNA level confirmed the transmission of the same molecular defect in Sp through four generations but with different patterns of clinical expression.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanical properties of sickle erythrocyte membranes were evaluated in the ektacytometer. When ghosts from the total red blood cell population were examined, the rigidity of the resealed ghosts and their rate of fragmentation by shear stress (t1/2) were normal. However, fractionation on Stractan density gradients revealed that sickle cells were heterogenous in their membrane mechanical properties. The ghosts from dense cell fractions exhibited both increased rigidity and decreased stability. Presumably, these altered mechanical properties are a reflection of the well-documented biochemical damage found in irreversibly sickle cell membranes. Nevertheless, neither of the alterations in mechanical properties are likely to be significant elements in the hemolysis of sickle cell anemia. Earlier studies of abnormal erythrocytes suggest that increases in membrane rigidity per se do not increase hemolysis, and they are, therefore, unlikely to do so in this case. The stability of membranes from the dense cell fractions was reduced to about two thirds of the control value. Comparison with the results of studies of red blood cell membranes with genetically defective or deficient spectrin suggests that a reduction in t 1/2 of 50% is not associated with significant increases in the rate of hemolysis. Although altered ghost stability and flexibility can be demonstrated in dense sickle cells, these changes in membrane mechanical properties are not likely to be significant factors in the hemolytic process.\r"

The precise mechanisms for this increased HbF production in culture have not been elucidated. We examined HbF biosynthesis by enriched human progenitors in serum-free (SF) culture. We measured globin chain biosynthesis by combination of isoelectric focusing and autoradiography and examined percent nucleated erythrocytes containing HbF (%FNRBC) using microscopic immunodiffusion. CD34 (My10)-positive marrow cells from a normal subject yielded an almost negligible amount of gamma-globin in SF culture stimulated by 100 U/mL interleukin-3 (IL-3) and 2 U/mL Ep, while corresponding FCS culture revealed significant gamma-globin biosynthesis. The %FNRBC of the erythroid bursts in SF cultures derived from nine normal adults (2.0% +/- 0.9% F cells) was 3.0% +/- 3.4%, while in FCS culture, it was 25% +/- 12% (mean +/- SD). Dosages of IL-3 between 10 and 10,000 U/mL did not increase %FNRBC in FCS of SF conditions. Mean Hb contents of nucleated erythrocytes (NRBC) assayed by microdensitometry of pericellular immunoprecipitate were similar in FCS and SF cultures. The number of erythroid bursts per 2 x 10(3) CD34-positive marrow cells was 48 +/- 20 in FCS and 36 +/- 12 in SF cultures. In two experiments, progenitors grown for 7 days under SF conditions were isolated and recultured in either SF or FCS conditions for 7 days, and the resulting erythroid bursts were analyzed for FNRBC. The bursts that had been returned to FCS cultures yielded values of %FNRBC intermediate between those obtained from progenitors grown entirely in SF or FCS cultures, indicating that serum effect is not solely due to growth selection for certain subpopulations of erythroid burst-forming units. This experiment also demonstrated that the factors present in serum responsible for HbF augmentation act at both early and late stages during erythroid burst development. SF culture of peripheral blood progenitors of one subject with heterocellular hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) yielded elevated levels of FNRBC (19% +/- 5%) that accurately reflected the F cell (18%) of the circulating blood. Similarly, FNRBC in cultures of progenitors from one umbilical cord blood sample (86% F reticulocytes) was 87 +/- 3% FNRBC. The SF culture for enriched human progenitors, which nearly reflects the physiologic HbF programs of the donor, should facilitate studies of the exact mechanisms of postnatal reactivation of HbF production.\r"

We evaluated the disposition of busulfan in children between 2 months and 3.6 years of age with lysosomal storage diseases, leukemia, and immunodeficiency disorders receiving oral doses of 1 or 2 mg/kg using a gas chromatographic assay. Peak concentrations were lower than those previously reported for adults, ranging from 1.4 to 5.2 mumol/L. The harmonic mean of the elimination half-life was 92 minutes, which is only slightly faster than that for adults (140 minutes). However, the area under the curve ranged from 400 to 1,000 (715 +/- 240) mumol.min/L, substantially lower than in adults receiving 1 mg/kg (range, 710 to 5,100 mumol.min/L; mean +/- SD, 2,180 +/- 1,200). The apparent volume of distribution (assuming complete bioavailability) ranged from 0.28 to 3.53 L/kg (1.42 +/- 0.86), which is more than twice that reported for adults (0.60 +/- 0.42). Busulfan clearance rate normalized to surface area is twice as high in children (200 +/- 100 mL/min/m2) as it is in adults (95 +/- 54 mL/min/m2). Alterations in bioavailability (absorption or first pass elimination) or in actual volume of distribution may account for these differences in drug disposition. The observed differences suggest the need for separate phase I dose escalation studies in children with accompanying pharmacokinetic assessment.\r"

  ".W": "From April, 1985, to February, 1989, 102 consecutive patients received unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) at four centers. Median age of the group was 31 years (range, 4.5 to 51 years). Fifty-four patients were in first chronic phase (CP) at time of transplantation, and 48 had evidence of more advanced disease (AD) (accelerated phase, 32; blast crisis, 9; second CP, 7). In 44 cases, the donor and recipient were identical at the HLA A, B, and DR loci and were nonreactive in bidirectional mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) (\"matched\"). In 58 cases, nonidentity between donor and recipient could be determined at at least one HLA locus or in bidirectional MLC (\"mismatched\"). Fifty-eight patients were prepared for transplantation with a combination of cyclophosphamide and fractionated total body irradiation (FTBI) and received acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisting of methotrexate alone or in combination with cyclosporine, prednisone, or antithymocyte globulin (ATG). In 44 cases, patients received preparative agents in addition to cyclophosphamide and FTBI, and marrow depleted of mature T lymphocytes by ex vivo incubation with either anti-CD3 antibody plus complement (n = 24) or Campath-1 (n = 20). Engraftment defined by a peripheral blood neutrophil count greater than 0.5 X 10(9)/L was demonstrated in 92 cases and occurred at a median of 22 days (range, 11 to 46 days). In 10 cases, peripheral blood evidence of engraftment did not occur, and in one case, engraftment was followed by aplasia. Hematologic relapse was seen in four cases. Recurrence or persistence of the Ph1 chromosome without evidence of hematologic relapse occurred in four additional cases. The incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD is 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], +/- 10%). After adjustment for recipient age and donor matching status, recipients of T lymphocyte-depleted donor marrow had a significantly lower incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD (P less than .01); however, T depletion was not significantly associated with improved survival (P = .34), disease-free survival (P = .51), or increased incidence of relapse (P = .39). Of 102 patients, 46 are alive, with a median survival of 12 months (range, 3 to 46 months), and the Kaplan-Meier estimate of disease-free survival is 29% (95% CI, +/- 9%) for the entire group at 2 1/2 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A high titer retroviral vector was used to transfer a human adenosine deaminase (h-ADA) cDNA into murine bone marrow cells in vitro. The h-ADA cDNA was linked to the retroviral promoter, and the vector also contained a neomycin phosphotransferase gene as a selectable marker. Infected marrow was transplanted into syngeneic W/Wv recipients, and h-ADA expression was monitored for 5.5 months. Several weeks after transplantation, h-ADA was detected in the erythrocytes of all nine recipients, eight of which expressed levels equal to the endogenous enzyme. This level of expression persisted in two of six surviving mice, while expression in three others stabilized at lower, but readily detectable, levels. Only one mouse had no detectable h-ADA after 5.5 months. Vector DNA sequences with common integration sites were found in hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues of the mice at 5.5 months, providing evidence that hematopoietic stem cells had been infected. Furthermore, all mice transplanted with marrow that had been selected in G418 before infusion had multiple vector copies per genome. While this category included the two highest h-ADA expressors, it also included the negative mouse. Thus, multiple copies of the vector were not sufficient to guarantee long-term h-ADA expression. Mice were monitored for \"helper virus\" infections with an assay designed to detect a wide range of replication-competent retroviruses, including those endogenous to the mouse genome. No helper virus was detected in the two highest h-ADA expressors, ruling out helper-assisted vector spread as a cause of the high h-ADA expression. These results help provide a foundation for the development of somatic gene therapy techniques to be used in the treatment of human disease.\r"

The following features of the lateral corticospinal tract are emphasized in the cervical cord: (1) the large extent of the white matter of the cord covered by the tract, and the anterior extent of the tract, the border being anterior to the central canal; (2) in the lower cervical cord, the separation of fibres from the main mass of the tract, which reach the periphery of the cord in the anterolateral sector; (3) the presence in many cords of the ventral crossed bundle; and (4) the relationship of the denticulate ligament to the tracts in the cervical segments. The following features of the anterior corticospinal tracts are emphasized: (1) their location, caudal extent and asymmetry; and (2) the changes in location in relation to the median fissure as the tract descends and its relationship to other tracts of the anterior column. Three-quarters of spinal cords are asymmetric and in three-quarters of asymmetric cords the right side is the larger. The asymmetry is due to a greater number of corticospinal fibres crossing to the right side. As more fibres have crossed in the decussation, the anterior tract opposite the large lateral tract is smaller than the ipsilateral anterior tract: that accounts for the asymmetry of the two halves of the cord. The greater number of corticospinal fibres in the right side of the cord is unrelated to handedness, but correlates with the fact that in three-quarters of corticospinal decussations, the crossing from left to right occurs at a more cranial level than the opposite crossing. A group of short peripheral ascending fibres is described running along the sides of the median fissure in the thoracic cord.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five human muscle afferents from the extensor digitorum muscles of the forearm were studied with the microneurographic method. Single unit impulses were recorded while the subjects performed alternating movements of moderate speed at the appropriate metacarpophalangeal joint. For comparison, responses to imposed movements of similar amplitudes and velocities were also studied. Most spindle afferents (n = 17) provided a stretch response with both kinds of movement. However, the impulse rate was slightly higher and the interspike interval variability much larger during active movement. Two units provided deviating response profiles: a flat profile and a converse stretch response. Small and constant torque loads usually failed to modify the response profile but gave rise to a moderate increase of impulse rate in 50% of the spindle afferents. In one single unit, a converse stretch response appeared with opposing loads. Tendon organ afferents (n = 8) were totally unmodulated by imposed stretch in the relaxed muscle. In contrast, their impulse rate was highly modulated during active movements, often following the rectified EMG which resulted in a converse relationship to muscle length and velocity. The findings support the view that, in general, human muscle spindles monitor muscle length and velocity in routine movements of moderate speed as long as opposing loads are small, whereas Golgi tendon organs monitor the amount of muscle recruitment. The significance of the deviating response profiles from spindle afferents remains obscure.\r"

The clinical features consisted of a bilateral pyramidal syndrome, weakness with atrophy and fasciculation of the hands and/or the legs, with or without a bulbar or a pseudobulbar syndrome and without sensory disturbance. Electromyography in 31 cases (including all index cases) showed evidence of denervation. Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity was normal; sensory nerve action potential amplitudes, examined in 11 cases, were also normal. Nerve and muscle biopsies taken in 29 cases (including all index cases) showed neurogenic atrophy in the peroneus brevis muscle and minor changes only in the superficial peroneal nerve. The mean age of onset was 12.06 (range 3-25 years), and progression was very slow. Inheritance appeared to be autosomal recessive. Depending on the clinical presentation, the patients were subdivided into three groups comprising (1) upper limb and sometimes bulbar amyotrophy with a bilateral pyramidal syndrome (17 patients: 11 familial and 6 isolated); (2) spastic paraplegia with peroneal muscular atrophy (14 patients: 11 familial and 3 isolated); and (3) a spastic pseudobulbar form (12 patients in a large kinship). These entities are discussed and compared with other cases reported in the literature.\r"

Duration of Gd-DTPA leakage for individual lesions in CREAE varied from 5 days to more than 5 wks. By contrast, in acute EAE leakage was of shorter duration (always less than 5 days). Selective enhancement was observed in CREAE lesions using Gd-protein markers. Gd-albumin enhancement was not always seen in areas of leakage of the smaller molecular weight compound Gd-DTPA. The addition of immunoglobulin to the gadolinium complex led to enhancement of lesions not seen with Gd-albumin alone. From the similarities between the histology and the patterns of Gd-enhancement in CREAE and multiple sclerosis, it is probable that Gd-enhancement reflects active inflammation (with or without demyelination) in the human disease.\r"

  ".U": "90227431\r", 
  ".W": "This paper examines three methodological issues concerning the measurement of semantic memory impairment in brain-damaged patients. Ten carefully selected patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) and anomia were studied. A battery of perceptual tests and direct tests of semantic memory led to the conclusion that these patients represented a homogeneous group having a prominent deterioration of their semantic memory store without visual perceptual deficits. The first issue addressed in this patient group was whether verbal fluency impairment accurately reflected the loss of semantic memory. It was found that verbal fluency (generation of semantic category lists) was impaired due to two major constraints: deterioration of semantic memory store, and variable difficulties in semantic search. Verbal fluency, therefore, reflects semantic memory loss to some degree, but is not a direct test of semantic memory store in DAT. The second issue was whether semantic memory impairment in our patients conformed to the 'semantic storage disorder' syndrome hypothesized by Shallice (1987). It was shown that, consistent with this hypothesis, the patients demonstrated co-occurrence of consistency of errors, loss of semantic cueing, and preserved superordinate knowledge with loss of detailed knowledge of concept items. The third issue was whether semantic cueing and semantic priming are altered in a similar manner in DAT. It demonstrated that semantic cueing and semantic priming, using the same words whose concepts were degraded in semantic memory, yielded an entirely different pattern of results. Cueing and priming therefore may not be used interchangeably in the study of semantic loss after brain damage.\r"

New ultrastructural findings include massive muscle cell elimination by apoptosis with the formation of membrane-bound muscle cell fragments, apoptotic bodies. In addition, numerous immature muscle fibres were observed. The morphological findings raise the possibility that in a severely growth-retarded muscle, the process of muscle cell apoptosis removes the peripheral target of anterior horn cells resulting in secondary motoneuron death.\r"

Electro-oculography showed a significant decrease of the maximum velocity of the visually-guided saccades in 83% of the patients. Smooth pursuit eye movements were not significantly different from age-matched controls. Visual evoked potential (VEP) latencies (P100) were significantly prolonged compared with controls in 64% of the patients. The saccadic latency of the visually-guided saccades was correlated with the prolonged VEP latencies, indicating that lesions in the primary visual pathways probably contribute to the oculomotor dysfunction. The isolated decrease of the maximum velocity of the saccades in combination with EMG findings favours a peripheral (dystrophic) pathophysiological mechanism.\r"

Four subjects with neglect were tested on a line bisection task in which these two hypotheses were differentiated by preventing direct viewing of the line and instead using a video camera and monitor, each of which could be moved independently into right or left hemispace. The performance of 2 subjects was consistent with the predictions of the directional hypokinesia hypothesis; the performance of the other 2 subjects was consistent with the attention-representation deficit hypothesis.

The general pattern of results in patients was a loss of sensitivity relative to normal controls at all temporal frequencies at 0 degree and 2.5 degrees eccentricity, with rather greater losses occurring at the medium-to-lower temporal frequencies. At 5 degrees eccentricity, the losses were confined to medium temporal frequencies only, and at 10 degrees eccentricity there was no significant loss at any temporal frequency. These findings may be explained by a greater vulnerability of optic nerve fibers of small diameters to the effects of demyelinating disease.\r"

The frequency of vacuolated anterior horn cells was not different at the individual ages studied (3 and 6 weeks, 3 months), but with the three ages combined, the frequency in the two systems differed significantly, being 1.7 +/- 0.9% in the cervical and 0.6 +/- 0.7% in the lumbar anterior horns (P = 0.005). The number of large myelinated nerve fibres (greater than or equal to 6 microns in diameter) became progressively reduced in ventral roots as the disease advanced, particularly for the forelimb. The total number of myelinated axons was well preserved in the hindlimb ventral roots because of an increase in the number of small myelinated nerve fibres. The regenerative capacity of motor neurons after axotomy (tested by radiolabelling growth cones) was well preserved. In the hindlimb, the increased numbers of small myelinated fibres in ventral roots and the normal regenerative capacity in the sciatic nerve and its branches contrast with the severely affected forelimb system. Our studies suggest that cervical and lumbar anterior horn cells have different susceptibilities to the wobbler gene, producing vulnerability in one system and disease resistance in the other.\r"

No spontaneous involuntary movements were seen after kainic acid injection alone (over a period of 4-14 days).

Preservation of some part of the striatum is therefore necessary for the generation of choreic movements. A considerable number of neurons in the rostral ventromedial putamen, which escaped the kainic acid lesion showed burst discharges when L-DOPA was administered. These were not seen in the caudate nucleus. The burst discharges recorded from some neurons were time-locked to the choreic movements. Since deafferentiation by dorsal root section had no effect, these burst discharges appeared to be generated in the unlesioned striatum during the choreic movements. Brains of 6 monkeys were analysed biochemically for gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration, choline acetyltransferase and tyrosine hydroxylase activity, and spiroperidol binding. Concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid, choline acetyltransferase activity and spiroperidol binding in the basal ganglia did not correlate with the generation of choreic movements. A finding which appeared to have a clear correlation was an increase in excess of 50% in tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the rostral ventromedial striatum on the lesioned side which escaped the kainic acid lesion in choreic monkeys as compared with the corresponding area on the intact side. It is, therefore, assumed that certain populations of 'activated' nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons which innervate the unlesioned area of the striatum may be more likely to attain a level of activity, induced by L-DOPA, sufficient to produce choreic movements in the contralateral limbs. Methamphetamine, but not apomorphine, given to 2 monkeys, produced an effect that was essentially the same as that of L-DOPA. These results support the hypothesis that the 'activated' dopaminergic components in choreic monkeys are the presynaptic dopaminergic nerve terminals rather than the postsynaptic dopaminergic receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Section of forebrain commissures results in a pervasive disconnection syndrome characterized by the incapacity of the two cerebral hemispheres to exchange their respective information content. Yet commissurotomized patients are capable of unified behaviour in their daily activities and, in laboratory situations, are able to produce a single response as a function of the information received by both hemispheres. This study further investigated the nature of the information that can be communicated between the disconnected hemispheres in 3 commissurotomized patients. The first part comprised 7 experiments in which the patients were required to compare 2 digits simultaneously, 1 projected to each hemisphere. While the stimulus and experimental conditions were the same across experiments, the information content on which to base the comparison was manipulated. The level of performance varied as a function of the information content, such that the patients were unable to decide whether the 2 digits were the same or different, performed better when required to compare the digits in terms of their odd-even category, and were highly accurate at deciding which digit was the higher. In addition, when instructed to focus on the numerical value of the digits to decide whether the 2 digits were the same or different, they performed significantly above chance. In the second part, they were requested to report verbally information about emotional faces and familiar faces projected to the right hemisphere. While they were unable to access the visual characteristics and the identity of the faces, they could provide various correct items of semantic information about the individuals. Taken together, the results indicate that the disconnection syndrome is limited to specific categories of information and does not extend to all the knowledge that may be derived from a given object. They also suggest that subcortical structures do not serve simply as pathways linking the two hemispheres but play an essential coordinating role in the integration of hemisphere activity.\r"

Between February 1985 and January 1988, 23 patients with true orbital cellulitis were admitted. CT scans were ordered routinely at the time of admission. The scans were cancelled for 13 children because they responded rapidly to medical management. CT showed edema nasal to the medial rectus, or thickening or displacement of the muscle in 8 of the 10 children who underwent the procedure. Three children required sinus and orbital drainage, but frank purulent material was found subperiosteally in only one. The results suggest that most children with orbital cellulitis can be managed with the prompt use of the appropriate intravenous antibiotics. Therapy with cloxacillin sodium and chloramphenicol or, in children under age 6 years, cefuroxime best covers the spectrum of organisms responsible for most cases of orbital cellulitis in children. CT should be used as an ancillary guide to the need for surgical exploration of the orbit in patients who do not rapidly respond to medical management.\r"

Most patients had a history of symptoms from childhood or following trauma. Typically, patients complained of torticollis and diplopia and manifested inferior oblique overaction and superior oblique underaction of the paretic eye. Twenty-two of the patients underwent a total of 28 operations; surgery resulted in elimination of symptoms and neutralization of the hyperdeviation in 77%. On the basis of this experience the authors discuss the presenting features and the differential diagnosis of superior oblique palsy and present a rational approach to surgical intervention.\r"

Five months later the inflammation rapidly became much worse, with fulminating abscesses, and the eye was eviscerated because of severe endophthalmitis. Nocardia organisms were identified in the cornea, conjunctiva and vitreous by means of acridine orange and modified Ziehl-Neelsen stains. The infection produced both suppurative and granulomatous inflammation. Reexamination of the penetrating keratoplasty specimen with a modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain revealed a few Nocardia organisms, which suggested that infection had occurred at the time of corneal perforation.\r"

We outline the clinical and visual function findings in 42 affected members from 10 families and 1 adopted person. There was a relative unawareness of the disorder in clinical practice. At least one of the main features of CSNB was absent in 75% of the patients. The visual function values varied widely, both between and within families (visual acuity 20/30 to 20/400, refractive error +1.50 to -22.50 and rod segment elevation 1.5 to 3.0 log units). The findings are consistent with a single allele exhibiting a wide variation in clinical expression.\r"

Of the 1629 women who gave birth between July 1 and Aug. 28, 1987, 1115 (68.4%) completed a self-administered questionnaire during the pregnancy, in the early postpartum period in hospital or at home. Of the respondents 577 (53.1%) said they would choose the caseroom, 316 (29.1%) the birthing room, 165 (15.2%) the birth centre and 30 (2.8%) home birth. The women who expressed an interest in a birthplace other than the caseroom were more likely than the others to be older, married, well-educated and interested in midwifery services and to breastfeed their babies (p less than 0.05). They were also more likely to have had a low-intervention vaginal birth (p less than 0.05). The interest expressed in birthing rooms, birth centres and home birth suggests that these alternatives should be considered for inclusion in the health care system.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two pathologic features (including estrogen and progesterone receptors) and four clinical features observed in 950 women with node-negative Stage I invasive breast cancer who enrolled in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Projects (NSABP) protocol B-06 were evaluated for their possible prognostic significance. Preliminary univariate analysis revealed ten characteristics that were significant in this regard at the 1% level. Their assessment in a Cox regression model demonstrated only three to be prognostically important; notable among these were nuclear grade, histologic tumor type, and race. Life-table plots revealed that 86% of patients whose cancers exhibited good nuclear grade survived for 8 years as opposed to 64% in whom the nuclear grade was scored as poor. Analyses demonstrated three prognostic categories for histologic tumor type. Patients with either mucinous, tubular, or papillary cancers fared significantly better than those having not otherwise specific (NOS) or atypical medullary tumors. Survival for those with typical medullary, NOS combinations, or lobular invasive cancers was intermediate. Blacks fared worse than whites. Survival was correspondingly better or worse when two favorable or unfavorable characteristics were detected. The number of black women in this cohort was considered too small for further subset analysis although generally the pattern of findings suggested that survival was worse for blacks than for whites in all subsets. A review, as well as our own experience, suggested that nuclear grade is as good if not better as a predictor of survival in node negative patients as information derived from DNA analyses, immunohistochemical demonstration of erb-B2 overexpression, and, possibly, the tumor labeling index at predicting survival in node-negative patients.\r"

After 1982 there was a reported increase in the incidence of breast cancer, presumably as a result of increased screening for the disease. The increase was especially noted in early stage breast cancer. The incidence of in situ cases also increased. Since 1973 the San Francisco-Oakland Bay area has reported a statistically significant decrease in mortality for white women. The evidence supports continued efforts at early breast cancer detection.\r"

  ".W": "In this article the value and limitations of the EMG examination in assessing patients with known or suspected sports-related nerve injuries is reviewed. The basic components of the EMG examination--the nerve conduction studies (NCS) and the needle electrode examination (NEE)--are described, and their components are defined. The types of pathophysiology produced by focal nerve lesions is detailed, and their effects on the various portions of the EMG examination are described. Of note is that the two processes that cause clinical weakness, conduction block and conduction failure (axon loss), both alter the NCS amplitudes, without having any appreciable effect on the rate of impulse conduction along the nerve fibers that can still conduct across the lesion site. For this reason, the most widely known NCS parameter, the conduction velocity, is of very little value with the acute type of nerve lesion usually encountered in sports. The fact that fibrillation potentials, seen on NEE, are the most sensitive indicator of motor axon loss, is noted, as is the fact that they do not appear until some 3 weeks following nerve injury. Our EMG laboratory experience with sports-related nerve injuries is reviewed. The majority of patients were engaged in contact sports (especially football). The majority of lesions affected primarily the shoulder girdle region, although a variety of disorders (radiculopathies, brachial plexopathies, various mononeuropathies) were found. Some of the difficulties in the EMG assessment of this region are reviewed, as well as the clinical and EMG findings with three entities, \"burners,\" acute brachial neuropathy, and rotator cuff tears, which affect it and which occur in athletes.\r"

Collection was done by means of a novel adhesive transcutaneous collection system. The transcutaneous collection system accumulated substances that migrated from the blood to the skin surface by trapping them in an activated charcoal-gel matrix. On one to three occasions, four transdermal collection systems were applied to the back or abdomen of each infant for 4 to 12 hours. During that time, blood samples were obtained for routine monitoring of plasma theophylline levels. Amounts of theophylline (95 +/- 198 ng) and caffeine (83 +/- 77 ng) in the transcutaneous collection system were significantly correlated with the respective average plasma drug concentration and postconceptional age (p less than 0.01). Skin reactions were limited to mild erythema. We concluded that theophylline and caffeine can be collected on the surface of the skin of preterm infants with a novel transcutaneous collection system. Amounts collected by means of the transcutaneous collection system correlated with plasma concentrations consistent with a diffusion process, but they were poor predictors of individual concentrations.\r"

In 10 healthy male volunteers, the short-term administration of theophylline, which affects both intracellular calcium and cAMP, lowered basal cortisol levels but augmented the in vivo cortisol response to short-term corticotropin stimulation. Short-term administration of nifedipine, a calcium channel antagonist, had no effect on basal or peak cortisol levels but reduced the incremental cortisol response to corticotropin. The effects of both theophylline and nifedipine, although statistically significant, were modest and of questionable clinical significance but should be considered in the interpretation of the clinical corticotropin stimulation test. They may also provide some insight into the post-receptor actions of corticotropin.\r"

When minoxidil was coadministered with tretinoin cream, minoxidil absorption was increased nearly threefold, compared with a 1.3-fold increase in absorption observed with coadministration of vehicle control cream. Transepidermal water loss measurements, which are sensitive to changes in stratum corneum function, were also significantly increased with tretinoin. No treatment-related changes in stratum corneum thickness were observed on the basis of skin biopsy analysis. The findings indicate that percutaneous minoxidil absorption is enhanced by tretinoin as a result of increased stratum corneum permeability.\r"

After receiving racemic propranolol orally for 6 days, the oral clearances of d-propranolol and l-propranolol were lower by 13% and 17% in the older group compared to the young group, but these differences were not statistically significant. The older subjects had higher alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentrations (p less than 0.05) and lower unbound fractions of l-propranolol (p less than 0.05). After protein binding was accounted for, the unbound oral clearance of each enantiomer was similar in both groups. l-Propranolol was more highly protein bound than d-propranolol (p less than 0.05) in both young and older subjects. The unbound oral clearance d/l ratio was not different from unity in either group, indicating that the stereoselective differences in oral clearance were largely attributable to the stereoselective differences in protein binding.\r"

Inhalant PAF challenge in healthy volunteers may provide a mean of testing PAF antagonists. The usefulness of the PAF provocation test in measuring the pharmacologic activity of a new PAF antagonist, WEB-2086, has been examined in 12 healthy volunteers in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover study. PAF-induced immediate bronchoconstriction, slight hemodynamic changes, and PAF-related subjective side effects. Premedication with WEB-2086 (40 mg) completely prevented any increase in airway resistance after PAF inhalation, as well as development of most of the cardiovascular and side effects induced by PAF. The clear protection against PAF-induced pharmacologic effects can be explained by the specific PAF-antagonistic activity of WEB-2086. The method described in this article may be applied as a useful tool for looking at PAF-antagonistic activity in healthy volunteers.\r"

Nicardipine plasma concentrations were substantially higher in the subjects with hepatic cirrhosis with impaired antipyrine clearance, as shown by a significantly higher average Cmax and AUC. The terminal elimination half-life in this group varied from 0.8 to 60.2 hours (median, 11.7 hours), compared with 0.6 to 4.1 hours (median, 1.4 hours) in the group of eight subjects with normal liver function. In the cirrhotic patients with impaired antipyrine clearance, the AUC of the pyridine metabolite averaged 10% of that of the parent drug, whereas in normal subjects the ratio averaged 48%. This finding suggests less conversion of nicardipine to this metabolite in subjects with impaired hepatic function. Peak blood pressure decreases were greater in the cirrhotic group, which was in keeping with the higher plasma levels in these subjects.\r"

The problem of separation of 7-methylxanthine (7X) from 1-methyluric acid (IU) in urine extracts was achieved by adding a phenyl column, in tandem with a C18 reverse-phase column, by means of a methanol:aqueous acetic acid gradient elution system. The urinary molar ratios of (AAMU)/(AAMU + 1U + 1X) and (AAMU)/(1X) were estimated in 20 subjects phenotyped with dapsone, with 100% concordance for the [AAMU]/[1X] ratio. A population study of 42 unrelated individuals exhibited trimodal distribution in acetylation capacity, consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg theory of population genetics. Definitive pedigree analysis of 16 families (75 subjects) resulted in significant similarity between the observed genotypic matings and those expected by classical Mendelian segregation. This noninvasive genotyping method promises to be useful in future investigation of the relationship between the human acetylation polymorphism and clinical disorders.\r"

We studied steady-state deferoxamine pharmacokinetics during intravenous infusion in two groups of patients--one group exhibited severe manifestations of auditory and visual loss and one group was asymptomatic. The groups were matched for age, sex distribution, weight, treatment period, ferritin levels, and hemoglobin levels. Similarly, doses of deferoxamine at the time of the study were not different. Clearance rates were not different between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (39.83 +/- 4.54 versus 30.66 +/- 4.39 ml/min.kg). However, patients who exhibited toxicity received significantly higher daily doses of subcutaneous deferoxamine at the time of diagnosis of neurotoxicity (9.03 +/- 0.96 and 5.58 +/- 0.61 mg/kg.hr, respectively; p less than 0.005). These data suggest that deferoxamine induced neurotoxicity is dose-dependent and cannot be attributed to accumulation of the drug caused by slower clearance rates.\r"

In all except one patient, there was marked relief of symptoms.

Concentrations above 400 to 500 nmol/L were required to ensure maximal effect in all patients, and we did not find any indication of a decreased effect at high drug levels. The dose-dependent kinetics of imipramine was confirmed, and dose increments should therefore be carried out in small steps and preferably with monitoring of drug levels.\r"

Subjects were analyzed individually, acting as their own controls, thus reducing interindividual variability. The present study showed that caffeine exhibited dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, particularly in subjects who showed high initial clearance with the low dose (70 mg) of caffeine. There was a significant decrease in caffeine clearance with increasing dose from 70 mg to 300 mg (n = 26, p less than 0.01, Dunnett's test), indicating saturable caffeine metabolism in the dose range tested. These findings imply that if caffeine is to be used as a guide to deteriorating liver function, serial caffeine clearance estimations should be performed in each individual subject, with use of the same dose of caffeine each time.\r"

  ".W": "Certain beta-adrenoceptor-mediated functions seem to diminish with age; however, information on alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated function is sparse and often conflicting but overall suggests little age-related change. To assess an age-related alteration in the responsiveness to an alpha 1-adrenergic agonist and to estimate changes in the apparent affinity of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor for the antagonist prazosin, we infused phenylephrine into 12 healthy elderly subjects and 12 healthy young subjects before and after an oral dose of prazosin, and we compared the shift in the dose-response curves for the two groups. With this protocol we were unable to detect any age-related decline in sensitivity of the alpha-adrenoceptor to either agonist or antagonist. However, oral prazosin resulted in higher plasma concentrations and a consistently greater hypotensive effect in the elderly subjects than in the young subjects. We concluded that there was no difference in alpha 1-adrenoceptor sensitivity in the elderly persons, but that the kinetics of prazosin may be altered and that the response of the blood pressure to prazosin was increased because of the kinetic changes and possibly the physiologic changes associated with aging.\r"

Serial blood samples and urine were collected for 24 hours after the dose of methotrexate and were assayed for methotrexate by a specific radioenzymatic method. In twelve patients who completed the study, methotrexate systemic clearance was not statistically different with naproxen (103.3 +/- 35.0 ml/min) versus without naproxen (113.4 +/- 48.3 ml/min; p = 0.37). Oral clearance of methotrexate was not statistically different with naproxen (161.7 +/- 55.0 ml/min) versus without naproxen (176.7 +/- 68.3 ml/min; p = 0.14). Likewise, there was not a significant difference in methotrexate renal clearance or plasma protein binding with or without naproxen. No toxicity was observed when patients received methotrexate alone or with naproxen. This study indicates that concomitant naproxen does not abruptly alter the disposition of low-dose methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have normal renal function.\r"

Single organ system failure (SOSF) occurred in 136 (28%) and multiple (greater than or equal to 2) organ system failure (MOSF) in 187 (38%) patients. Cardiovascular and pulmonary failure predominated. Overall mortality was 27%. SOSF mortality was 16% and for MOSF 58%. Eighty-three percent of nonsurvivors had MOSF. Hence, MOSF is common and a major cause of death in critically ill medical patients. Advancing age and prior chronic disease may diminish physiologic reserve and predispose to sepsis and MOSF. Although sepsis is a major risk factor for MOSF, a nonspecific host response to critical illness may contribute to the syndrome in 35% of patients. Advancing age, chronic disease, and the number of failing organs, particularly failure of cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and neurologic systems, are major determinants of overall mortality, but sepsis is not an independent contributor.\r"

Fifteen CIP patients with the following clinical criteria were diagnosed: limb weakness, amyotrophy, and reduced deep tendon reflexes. Electromyogram (EMG) confirmed polyneuropathy by the following signs: denervation, normal nerve conduction velocities, normal distal latencies, and decreased compound action potential. It was observed that motor signs were more important than sensitivity. EMG performed during ICU hospitalization showed axonal abnormalities. Ventilation and mean duration of weaning were unusually long. Four patients had EMG a few years after discharge; the recovery was delayed and incomplete. The present study suggests that CIP is a multifactorial disease.\r"

The whole blood activated clotting time (ACT) test is used universally to monitor heparin therapy during this procedure. To enhance our understanding of this test and improve our management of anticoagulation, we studied the relationship between the ACT and blood heparin concentration in nine infants during ECMO. The activated clotting time correlated with the simultaneously determined heparin concentration (r = .55, p less than .001 for all patients samples; r = .92, p less than .001 for mean patients values). Within the range of values found in our patients, platelet count, fibrinogen, and fibrin degradation products did not affect the ACT-heparin concentration relationship. However, the interpretation of an individual ACT result was limited by its low precision: the mean difference of duplicate determinations was 9.2%, and the estimation of heparin concentration by a single ACT had a coefficient of variation of 32%. Two commercially available techniques using different activators gave results that differed numerically but correlated well with each other. Both provided similar precision in the estimation of heparin concentration. The ACT is a low cost, bedside test whose accuracy and precision allow the achievement of target heparin concentrations required in infants during ECMO. Multiple determinations, either in duplicate or serially, are needed to achieve satisfactory precision. These data will be useful in designing future studies to determine the optimal serum heparin concentration to provide adequate anticoagulation, but avoid bleeding complications.\r"

Diaphragmatic flutter (DF) is an easily overlooked breathing pattern characterized by rapid (greater than 40 times/min) involuntary contractions of the diaphragm, at times superimposed on a more normal breathing pattern (dirhythmic breathing). Using respiratory inductive plethysmography, we were able to record this unusual ventilatory pattern in four patients after CABG. All procedures were performed via median sternotomy with topical hypothermia. Sternal complications were present in three cases (instability, dehiscence, infection). DF could not be suppressed by mechanical hyperventilation or patient volition. Weaning was unsuccessful until after DF abated. Diaphragmatic flutter may occur after CABG and should be considered as a cause of failure to wean from mechanical ventilator support in this setting.\r"

Titration to diastolic BP goal (95 to 110 mm Hg) was followed by a constant infusion phase (greater than or equal to 6 h), a detitration phase (2 h), and a postinfusion phase. FNP reduced BP by 27/29 mm Hg (p less than .001) with no significant effect on heart rate. Maintenance of the BP effect was noted through the 6 h of constant rate infusion. Mild, transient vasodilating-associated adverse effects were noted with FNP.

Points were determined by the quantity of life-threatening complications requiring nursing-assisted procedures for each patient during the CCU stay. Due to a low incidence of complications and need for interventions, the majority of unstable angina patients were in the acuity level I (78%). The CCU nursing workload for the unstable angina patients was moderately low. These data indicate that a significant percentage of unstable angina patients do not need therapy that requires a CCU setting.\r"

Rrsmax was partitioned into its homogeneous component (Rrsmin) and that due to the unevenness within the respiratory system (Rrsu). Respiratory mechanics were studied both before and immediately after bleeding in eight animals. Another eight guinea pigs had received propranolol previously and were also submitted to hemorrhage. Propranolol-treated animals showed higher control values of Rrsmax (p less than .02) and Rrsmin (p less than .0001). Animals not treated with propranolol exhibited a decrease (p less than 0.001) in Rrsmax after hemorrhagic hypovolemia (from 0.375 +/- 0.051 to 0.323 +/- 0.042 cm H2O/ml.sec), due to a decrease (p less than 0.005) in Rrsmin (from 0.140 +/- 0.031 to 0.094 +/- 0.032 cm H2O/ml.sec), whereas Ers and Rrsu did not change.

The effects of dopexamine on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) are not known. We investigated this using an isolated, blood-perfused, and ventilated rat lung model. To study HPV, the ventilating gas was changed from an FIO2 of 0.21 to 0.03 and dopexamine hydrochloride was added. At blood concentrations of 100, 200, and 300 ng/ml, dopexamine caused a significant decrease in HPV of 22 +/- 3%, 31 +/- 4%, and 58 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM, p less than .05), respectively. This effect was blocked completely by pretreatment of the preparation with propranolol (0.5 mg/kg, p less than .05). Dopexamine also induced significant (p less than .05) vasodilation of the pulmonary circulation preconstricted under normoxic conditions with prostaglandin F2 alpha, suggesting that the effects of the drug were not specific to hypoxia. We conclude that dopexamine inhibits HPV and vasodilates the pulmonary circulation by stimulation of beta 2 adrenoceptors.\r"

Many of these patients are not intubated and are at increased risk for aspiration of large volumes of UGIT contents containing sucralfate. The effects of aspirated sucralfate are unknown. To investigate this, large-volume aspiration (2 ml/kg) was simulated in freshly tracheostomized rats (n = 6, all experimental groups) using normal saline, particulate antacid, and sucralfate adjusted to pH 3.6 and 5.0. Four hours after aspiration, the rats were killed and their lungs were formalin-fixed. Significant increases in lung inflammation were seen by light microscopy in all experimental groups at pH 3.6. Antacid aspirated at pH 5.0 induced significant increases in airway as well as parenchymal inflammation. At pH 3.6, the antacid aspiration led to significant increases in lung edema and hemorrhage. Sucralfate aspiration produced significant increases in pulmonary hemorrhage at pH 5.0. Our microscopic findings are consistent with the acute pulmonary histopathologic changes known to occur after large-volume aspiration of particulate materials, including antacids. Additionally, we show that large-volume aspiration of sucralfate produced significant acute pneumonitis, including pulmonary hemorrhage. In view of the proven usefulness of sucralfate, further investigations are indicated to evaluate these experimental findings before extrapolating to critically ill patients.\r"

The present studies were performed to determine the temporal sequence of mucosal injury, permeability, and bacterial translocation after hemorrhagic shock. The results indicated that bacterial translocation and mucosal injury have occurred by 2 h after a 30-min episode of shock (mean arterial pressure 30 mm Hg). Although the histologic extent of the intestinal mucosal injury was less at 2 h postshock than at 24 h postshock, at both times intestinal barrier function was lost as measured by permeability to horseradish peroxidase. Since the role of translocating bacteria in potentiating the loss of intestinal barrier function after shock is unclear, the second goal was to determine whether the extent of shock-induced mucosal injury and permeability could be reduced or abrogated by antibiotic decontamination of the gut. The extent of shock-induced mucosal injury and intestinal permeability was similar between rats with a normal gut flora (greater than 10(6) bacteria/g cecum) and antibiotic-decontaminated rats (less than 10(3) bacteria/g cecum) 2 h postshock, although the incidences of bacterial translocation were 67% and 0, respectively. Thus, shock-induced mucosal permeability and injury appear not to be directly related to the presence of translocating bacteria.\r"
