  ".W": "The possible carcinogenic effects of antisecretory agents used in the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcer were investigated in a population based cohort study of 16,739 patients who were prescribed the H2-antagonist cimetidine between 1977 and 1981. An excess risk for gastric cancer was observed, with a relative risk of about 10 in the first year after beginning use of the drug, which decreased thereafter. A similar pattern was seen for cancers of the colon, pancreas and gall bladder, and for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These increased risks probably represent cases in which a malignancy was misdiagnosed as a gastric ulcer. The excess risk for gastric cancer was unaffected by the method of diagnosis, the risk in those who had undergone an endoscopy being similar to those who had been diagnosed by an x-ray examination. A relative risk of 1.5-2.0 was observed for cancer of the respiratory organs, with no effect of latency, indicating that there are common risk factors for peptic ulcer and for lung cancer. Although the observed increases in cancer risk in persons receiving cimetidine is probably caused by factors other than a carcinogenic action of the drug itself, this possibility cannot be ruled out because of the short period of follow up.\r"

In the present study immunohistochemical localisation of C3 and of a neoantigen exposed only on the terminal C5b-9 complement complex has been performed on small intestinal biopsy sections from newly diagnosed untreated coeliac patients, from coeliac patients on long-term gluten-free diet and from disease controls. Levels of C3 were markedly increased in treated coeliac patients compared with controls. Staining of C3 was concentrated subepithelially and within the centre of the lamina propria. No staining was detected at these sites using antibody to the neoantigen, however, strongly suggesting that the increased levels of C3 seen in the coeliac patients was the result of increased extravasation of serum proteins rather than complement activation. Surprisingly, complement activation was detected within the glands of Brunner. Positive staining using anti-C5b-9 neoantigen was found in all coeliac patients, both treated and untreated. Three of the 13 disease controls also showed reactivity with this antibody. This novel finding suggests that Brunner's glands, hitherto largely neglected structures, may play an important role in the development of coeliac disease.\r"

Paired immunofluorescence staining was performed with subclass specific murine monoclonal antibodies in combination with polyclonal rabbit antibody reagent to total IgG; the proportion of cells belonging to each subclass could thereby be determined. The ratio of IgG2 immunocytes was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in untreated coeliac disease patients (median, 35.2%; range, 26.7-65.2%) than in those on a gluten free diet (median, 7.3%; range, 0-31.9%) or those having food allergy (median, 12.5%; range, 0-36.5%). The disparity in the local IgG2 response between patients with untreated coeliac disease and those with food allergy might be due to differences in the nature of the antigenic stimuli, dissimilar genetic 'make-up' of the subjects, or both.\r"

  ".U": "90093095\r", 
  ".W": "The possibility that the mode of action of sulphasalazine and its active metabolite 5-amino-salicylic acid (5ASA) involves modification of toxic oxygen metabolite production by neutrophils has been investigated by measuring the effect of these drugs on luminol-dependent chemiluminescence, superoxide release and oxygen consumption by stimulated neutrophils in vitro. 5ASA, and to a lesser extent sulphasalazine, had profound inhibitory effects on the luminol dependent chemiluminescent response of neutrophils stimulated with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (1 microM) + cytochalasin B (5 micrograms/ml). A concentration of 50 microM 5ASA or sulphasalazine produced 93.8 (2.3)% and 65.7 (3.7)% inhibition of control responses respectively. The concentration of 5ASA and sulphasalazine producing 50% inhibition of chemiluminescence were 3.6 (1.8) microM and 16.5 (6) microM respectively. Both drugs had little effect on the chemiluminescent response of neutrophils stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (1 microgram/ml), producing only 11.4 (3.9)% and 34 (7)% inhibition respectively, at a concentration of 50 microM. Superoxide release from fMLP + CB stimulated neutrophils was also inhibited slightly by 5ASA (50 microM) by 35.6% and by sulphasalazine (50 microM) by 7.9%. Similarly, there was little inhibition in the rate of oxygen consumption by fMLP + CB stimulated neutrophils by either 5ASA or sulphasalazine at concentrations which produced near total abolition of luminol dependent chemiluminescence. These results show that sulphasalazine and 5ASA inhibit the reaction of toxic metabolites produced by stimulated neutrophils with luminol, without inhibition of the oxidase system producing these metabolites. The site of action of these drugs on neutrophils in vitro is thus extracellular, by scavenging a released metabolite, probably hypochlorite.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After 56 weeks no animals in the simple gastrojejunostomy group had pancreatic hyperplasia whereas all 10 animals in the split gastrojejunostomy group had generalised pancreatic hyperplasia with macroscopic nodules. Microscopy of the nodules showed that in nine animals hyperplastic nodules had developed, and four of these also had adenomatous nodules. The remaining animal had enlarged lymph nodes. Pancreatic hyperplasia was associated with jejunal hyperplasia. Jejunal morphometry showed that the villus height was doubled and the villus height:crypt depth ratio was higher in the split gastrojejunostomy group compared with those animals with a simple gastrojejunostomy. This finding represents a new model for the investigation of pancreatic neoplastic change.\r"

During this period the tumour markedly increased in size and the oesophagus reached a maximum diameter of 5.9 cm. In presence of the polyp the body of the oesophagus had no pressure activity after swallows and a 22 hour intraoesophageal pH record showed pH greater than 7 for 31.4% of the time and never pH less than 4. After excision of the tumour the oesophagus regained normal size and peristalsis. Intraoesophageal pH greater than 7 and less than 4 were recorded for 1.6% and 16.1% of the time respectively. Dysmotility was probably a contributing factor to the genesis of dysphagia induced by the giant fibrovascular polyp. Prolonged alkalinisation of intraoesophageal pH conceivably reflected altered oesophageal clearing of alkaline salivary and/or oesophageal secretions.\r"

Seven hundred and fifty one replied (398 leafleted, 353 non-leafleted). Most patients found the leaflets helpful and easy to understand; few found them worrying. They were regarded as a better source of information than doctors, particularly for information about the characteristics of the illness and side effects of treatment. In all diagnostic groups assessed the patients' knowledge of their disease was significantly greater if they had received a leaflet than if they had not. Individual responses by patients without leaflets showed that fundamental misconceptions persisted about digestive diseases.

  ".W": "Patients on chronic hemodialysis often present both hyperlipidemia and a high incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Uremic hyperlipidemia has usually been regarded as one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) in these patients. In order to study whether the \"uremia-induced\" lipid abnormalities are actually associated with evidence of uremic CVD, and consequently may be considered reliable CVRF, 123 patients on chronic dialysis were reviewed for the presence of CVD and, at the same time, examined for their lipoprotein pattern and other clinical and biochemical variables. Lipids and lipoproteins did not prove helpful in our study in identifying patients with CVD. Despite the fact that they had been on dialysis for a shorter time, CVD patients were significantly older and had higher blood pressure than patients without CVD. Our data suggest that the uremia-induced lipid abnormalities are not reliable markers of CVD in dialysis patients, and support the hypothesis that dialysis per se does not accelerate the atherosclerotic process in uremic patients.\r"

In 7 patients, aluminium kinetics were studied during haemodialysis using the Redy 2000 Sorbysystem, D3260 cartridges. S557 acetate concentrate and Gambro hollow fibre dialyser (cuprophane 120M). The same patients were also studied during conventional haemodialysis using the Gambro AK10 proportionating system with acetate dialysate and Gambro hollow fibre dialyser (cuprophane 120M). There was no significant rise in plasma aluminium concentration during dialysis on the Redy 2000 Sorbsystem. The post-dialysis plasma aluminium concentrations were significantly higher after conventional haemodialysis, however, and the explanation for this is not clear but is not accounted for by differences in the degree of ultrafiltration during the studies. A significant rise in dialysate aluminium concentration was observed after 4 hours of dialysis on the Redy 2000 Sorbsystem. The manufacturer's ammonia test papers appear to be too insensitive as indicators of cartridge exhaustion and dialysate pH may be better. The D3260 cartridges should be used for a maximum of 4 hours only. Further long-term studies of aluminium kinetics using this system are justified.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that calcium salts of keto-analogues (KA) have beneficial effects on phosphocalcic and aminoacid (AA) metabolism. To confirm this, their short-term effects were evaluated on chronic dialyzed patients. In a prospective, randomised, crossover study, eight and seven patients were put on KA (200 mg/kg/d) and assigned either a low-protein diet (LP:0.4 g/kg/d) or a normal one (NP: 1 g/kg/d) for 15 days. The two treatments were interchanged after 15 days of washout. KA.LP was accompanied by: a) decreases in calorie intake (12%; p = 0.001) and in blood concentrations of albumin (5%, p = 0.004), urea (32%, p = 0.001), phosphate (29%, p = 0.001), parathormone (27%, p = 0.008), isoleucine (24%, p = 0.04), 1 and 3 methyl-histidine (71%, p = 0.03; 24%, p = 0.005), valine (19%, p = 0.004) and hydroxyproline (85%, p = 0.009); b) increases in calcemia (9%, p = 0.002), cystathionine (991%, p = 0.0001) and threonine (22%, p = 0.04). KA.NP was accompanied by: a) decreases in phosphatemia (15%, p = 0.03) and parathormone (18%, p = 0.06); b) increases in calcemia (9%, p = 0.002), cystathionine (427%, p = 0.0001), and phenylalanine (28%, p = 0.013). Calcium salts of keto-analogues together with a low or normal protein diet thus seem to reduce blood concentrations of phosphates and parathormone, and raise calcium; however their action on aminoacids needs further investigation.\r"

Hypovolaemia prior to treatment was corrected and a total of 14 isovolaemic 17 litre exchanges carried out using either a Gambro FH77 (8) or Hospal 3600 (6) haemofilter. Intracranial pressure (ICP) increased during treatment with both types of filter, but the increase was greater in the Gambro FH77 treated group, mean ICP increased from 7.6 +/- 2 mmHg to 12 +/- 3 mmHg at 3 hours (p less than 0.05), this was associated with a greater fall in the percentage change from the pretreatment value of both arterial oxygen tension and total peripheral white blood cell count during the first hour of treatment compared to the Hospal 3600 treated group, 8 +/- 2% vs 1 +/- 2% (p less than 0.05) and 5 +/- 2% vs 3 +/- 2% (p less than 0.05).

Many of these cells are histologically indistinguishable from osteoclasts. We present a patient in whom this histiocytic reaction appeared to be of sufficient magnitude to stimulate bone resorption and to cause severe osteodystrophy. This observation, and those of other investigators reviewed in the discussion, suggest that oxalate deposition within bone may contribute to the pathogenesis of uremic osteodystrophy in chronic renal failure patients with primary or secondary types of oxalosis.\r"

Proteinuria was weakly correlated with cadmium concentration of urine (p less than 0.05, R = 0.35). Patients with renal hypertension showed a significantly higher (p less than 0.05) urine cadmium excretion per day (1.60 +/- 1.12 micrograms/day) compared to normotensives with a disease of the kidney (1.14 +/- 1.47 micrograms/day).

Collateral system resistance (Rcs) was measured before and after dry-air challenge. Base-line Rcs was similar throughout the lung periphery, between dogs, and over time. Increasing base-line Rcs was correlated with increasing maximum Rcs 5 min postchallenge (Rcs5), increasing change in Rcs (dRcs5), and decreasing percent change in Rcs above base line (%Rcs5). In contrast to repeated challenge in which base-line Rcs was similar, the magnitude of AIB associated with consecutive challenges with unequal base lines depended on the parameter used to evaluate the response (i.e., Rcs5, dRcs5, or %Rcs5). Peripheral lung resistance then increased to a stimulus specific maximum regardless of base-line Rcs, although data expressed as %Rcs5 or dRcs5 may obscure this observation. Although a change in peripheral lung resistance does not necessarily imply airway narrowing, it is consistent with the idea that changes in Rcs are independent of the collateral system's resting tone.\r"

The animals were then injected intravenously with a number of substances that possessed the common properties of stimulating the phagocytic activity of the cells of the reticuloendothelial system and of acting as immunoadjuvants. The substances used were zymosan, lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, and muramyl dipeptide. Three days after any of these immunoadjuvants were injected, the fever sensitivity of the rats was remeasured. In each case, the slope of the fever dose-response curve tripled, and in some instances the response threshold for fever response was reduced by factors of three to eight. Furthermore, the maximum increase in body temperature produced by the endogenous pyrogen was more than doubled after immunoadjuvant treatment. By contrast latex beads, which are also phagocytized by the cells of the reticuloendothelial system but do not subsequently increase their phagocytic index nor do they enhance immune responses, had no effect on the fever sensitivity of rats in response to endogenous pyrogen. In the light of these findings, it is suggested that the febrile responses of rats to endogenous pyrogen are mediated in some manner by cells that possess some of the properties of reticuloendothelial cells. The location of these putative cells must be close to the circulation, because the immunoadjuvants used in this study were, for the most part, large molecular weight molecules that could not cross the blood-brain barrier easily.\r"

  ".W": "The febrile responses of male Sprague-Dawley rats to a semi-purified endogenous pyrogen (EP) derived from human monocytes are markedly enhanced 3 days after the animals are intravenously injected with a variety of immunoadjuvants. The present study was designed to investigate the site within the body at which these substances act to produce this febrile-enhancing phenomenon. Stainless steel microinjection cannula guide tubes were implanted within the region of the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT) of the rats and control febrile dose-response curves to EP were established. Minute quantities of the immunoadjuvants zymosan, lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, and the synthetic adjuvant peptide, muramyl dipeptide, were microinjected into the OVLT region and 3 days later, the febrile responses of the animals were retested. In each case the febrile response elicited by a standard dose of EP was more than doubled, the slope of the fever dose-response curve was tripled, and the dose threshold was lowered by a factor of four to five. These responses are identical with those produced when much larger amounts of these immunoadjuvants are injected intravenously, and, thus, we conclude that the site of action of these substances in enhancing fever in response to EP resides in or near the OVLT region. It is proposed that EP stimulates a type of reticuloendothelial cell residing within the OVLT to release prostaglandin E, which in turn crosses the blood-brain barrier to effect the changes in the thermoregulatory neurons of the preoptic anterior hypothalamic area that result in fever.\r"

  ".W": "Effects on ventilatory responses to progressive isocapnic hypoxia of a synthetic potent progestin, chlormadinone acetate (CMA), were determined in the halothane-anesthetized male rat. Ventilation during the breathing of hyperoxic gas was largely unaffected by treatment with CMA when carotid chemoreceptor afferents were kept intact. The sensitivity to hypoxia evaluated by hyperbolic regression analysis of the response curve did not differ between the control and CMA groups. The reduction of ventilation after bilateral section of the carotid sinus nerve (CSN) in hyperoxia was less severe in CMA-treated than in untreated animals. Furthermore, the CMA-treated rats showed a larger increase in ventilation during the hypoxia test and a lower PO2 break point for ventilatory depression. Inhibition of hypoxic ventilatory depression by CMA persisted even after the denervation of CSN. We conclude that exogenous progestin likely protects regulatory mechanism(s) for respiration against hypoxic depression through a stimulating action independent of carotid chemoreceptor afferents and without a change in the sensitivity of the ventilatory response to hypoxia.\r"

To study the effects of exercise on sustained maximal voluntary ventilation immediately after exercise, eight elite cross-country skiers performed a 4-min maximal sustained ventilation (MSV) test before and immediately after exhaustive exercise. Subjects were encouraged to maintain maximal ventilation (VE) throughout the MSV test. To encourage greater effort, rapid visual feedback of VE was provided on a computer terminal along with a target VE based on their 12-s maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV). The subjects (7 males, 1 female) were 18.5 +/- 0.9 yr old (mean +/- SD) and exercised for 62.5 +/- 16.7 min at 77 +/- 5% of their maximum oxygen consumption during which average VE was 106.7 +/- 24.2 l/min BTPS. The mean MVV was 196.0 +/- 29.9 l/min or 107% of their age- and height-predicted MVV. Before exercise the MSV was 86% of the MVV or 176.7 +/- 30.5 l/min, whereas after exercise the MSV was 90% of the MVV or 180.3 +/- 28.9 l/min (P = NS). The total volume of gas expired during the 4-min MSV was 706.7 +/- 121.9 liters before and 721.2 +/- 115.5 liters after exercise (P = NS). In this group of athletes, exhaustive exercise produced no deleterious effects on the ability to perform a 4-min MSV test immediately after exercise.\r"

Animals were mechanically ventilated by a constant flow ventilator. Compliance (C) and conductance (G) of the respiratory system were continuously monitored. Three series of experiments were performed involving intravenous pretreatment with 1) atropine (3 mg/kg) and propranolol (1 mg/kg); 2) atropine (3 mg/kg), propranolol (1 mg/kg), and phentolamine (2 mg/kg); and 3) atropine (3 mg/kg) and hexamethonium (2 mg/kg). 5-HT was then intravenously infused for 5 min at a rate of 40 ng.kg-1.s-1 in adults and 60 ng.kg-1.s-1 in young guinea pigs to obtain the same degree of bronchoconstriction in both groups. At the 3rd min of the infusion, bilateral cervical vagotomy was performed and C and G were measured at the maximal response, 1-2 min thereafter. Vagotomy increased bronchoconstriction (P less than 0.01) in both young animals and adults. Phentolamine did not modify this increase, but hexamethonium completely inhibited it. These results indicate that, in adult and young guinea pigs, 5-HT infusion induces reflex activation of the nonadrenergic inhibitory system, which in turn modulates the bronchoconstrictor responses to 5-HT. This neural modulation is not mediated by an alpha-adrenergic pathway.\r"

First, the applicability of the 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) tracer technique during in vivo hyperglycemia was investigated in model systems in vitro. Epitrochlearis muscle and spleen cells were incubated with 1.25-20 mM glucose. The discrimination against 2-[14C]DG in glucose metabolic pathways, expressed by the lumped constant, remained unchanged over this wide range of glucose concentrations. It was concluded that in vivo hyperglycemia does not preclude the application of the 2-DG method. In a series of in vivo experiments, chronically catheterized conscious rats fasted for 24 h and were infused with epinephrine (0.2 microgram.kg-1.min-1), which produced a two-fold increase in plasma glucose concentration. 2-[14C]DG was injected 30 min after starting the epinephrine infusion and glucose utilization rates of individual tissues were calculated based on the concentration of phosphorylated 2-DG in samples excised at 70 min. The epinephrine infusion increased glucose utilization rates by 40-160% in hindlimb muscles, skin, ileum, liver, spleen, lung, epididymal fat, and kidney, although no change was found in the brain. Mass action of the increased plasma glucose is likely to play an important role in the enhanced rate of glucose utilization.\r"

  ".W": "Currently, the effect of intrathoracoabdominal, extrapulmonary volume displacements (Vep) are not well understood. Various clinical conditions can lead to volume displacements caused by gas or liquid accumulations. To analyze the pressure and volume changes that occur by Vep, we used a mathematical model of chest wall and lung mechanics that accounts for static changes associated with rib cage, diaphragm, abdomen, and lungs. By solving the model equations, we obtained simulations of the pleural and abdominal displacements that clearly differentiate the mechanisms involved. When abdominal displacement occurs, the reduction in lung volume is less than that caused by an equal displacement in pleural space. Abdominal displacement produces an increased pressure that expands the rib cage significantly, whereas pleural displacement does not produce a comparable action. Furthermore, our model predicts the conditions under which the work of inspiration is expected to increase as a consequence of these displacements. Finally, an important distinction is predicted between abdominal displacements caused by gas or liquid accumulation. Although an abdominal gas displacement tends to decrease the resting lung volume, the weight effect of a liquid displacement tends to increase the resting lung volume by pulling down the diaphragm.\r"

In eight healthy men we simultaneously measured BF to the forearm and calf (venous occlusion plethysmography) and arterial blood pressure (sphygmomanometry) and calculated whole limb VR before (control) and during 3 min of cycling with the contralateral leg at 38, 56, and 75% of peak one-leg O2 uptake (VO2). During the initial phase of exercise (0-1.5 min) at all work loads, BF increased and VR decreased in the forearm (P less than 0.05), whereas calf BF and VR remained at control levels. Thereafter, BF decreased and VR increased in parallel and progressive fashion in both limbs. At end exercise, forearm BF and VR were not different from control values (P greater than 0.05); however, in the calf, BF tended to be lower (P less than 0.05 at 75% peak VO2 only) and VR was higher (23 +/- 9, 44 +/- 14, and 88 +/- 23% above control at 38, 56, and 75% of peak VO2, respectively, all P less than 0.05). In a second series of studies, forearm and calf skin blood flow (laser-Doppler velocimetry) and arterial pressure were measured during the same levels of exercise in six of the subjects. Compared with control, skin BF was unchanged and VR was increased (P less than 0.05) in the forearm by end exercise at all work loads, whereas calf skin BF increased (P less than 0.05) and VR decreased (P less than 0.05). The present findings indicate that skeletal muscle and skin VR are controlled differently in the nonactive forearm and calf during the initial phase of rhythmic exercise with the contralateral leg. Skeletal muscle vasodilation occurs in the forearm but not in the calf; forearm skin vasoconstricts, whereas calf skin vasodilates. Finally, during exercise a time-dependent vasoconstriction occurs in the skeletal muscle of both limbs.\r"

To address this, in nine healthy subjects (aged 19-27 yr) we measured heart rate, systolic arterial blood pressure, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity in the leg (MSNA; peroneal nerve) before (control) and during 2.5 min of isometric handgrip exercise (30% of maximal voluntary force). Exercise was performed with the right and left arms separately and with both arms simultaneously (random order). During exercise, heart rate, systolic pressure, and MSNA increased above control under all conditions (P less than 0.05). For each variable, the magnitudes of the increases from control to the end of exercise were significantly greater when exercise was performed with two arms compared with either arm alone (P less than 0.05). In general, the increases in heart rate, systolic pressure, and MSNA elicited during two-arm exercise were significantly less than the simple sums of the responses evoked during exercise of each arm separately. These findings indicate that the magnitude of the sympathetic neural activation evoked during isometric exercise in humans is determined in part by the size of the active muscle mass. In addition, our results suggest that the sympathetic cardiovascular adjustments elicited during exercise of separate limbs are not simply additive but instead exhibit an inhibitory interaction (i.e., neural occlusion).\r"

Nineteen men (aged 32-42 yr) were divided into no exercise control (peak VO2 once/wk, n = 5), isokinetic (Lido ergometer, n = 7), and isotonic (Quinton ergometer, n = 7) groups. Exercise training was conducted in the supine position for two 30-min periods/day for 5 days/wk. Isotonic training was at 60-90% of peak VO2, and isokinetic training (knee flexion-extension) was at 100 degrees/s. Mean (+/- SE) changes (P less than 0.05) in peak VO2 (ml.m-1.kg-1) from ambulatory control to BR day 28 were 44 +/- 4 to 36 +/- 3, -18.2% (3.27-2.60 l/m) for no exercise, 39 +/- 4 to 40 +/- 3, +2.6% (3.13-3.14 l/min) for isotonic, and 44 +/- 3 to 40 +/- 2, -9.1% (3.24-2.90 l/min) for isokinetic. There were no significant changes in any groups in leg peak torque (right knee flexion or extension), leg mean total work, arm total peak torque, or arm mean total work. Mean energy costs for the isotonic and isokinetic exercise training were 446 kcal/h (18.8 +/- 1.6 ml.min-1.kg-1) and 214 kcal/h (8.9 +/- 0.5 ml.m-1.kg-1), respectively. Thus near-peak, variable intensity, isotonic leg exercise maintains peak VO2 during 30 days of BR, while this peak, intermittent, isokinetic leg exercise protocol does not.\r"

Morphological assay indicated that radial growth of soleus myofibers was completely inhibited between 3 and 10 days of suspension and reduced thereafter, leading to a severe attenuation (-76% from control) over the total experimental period. Longitudinal growth rate, however, was accelerated 40% over weight-bearing controls. In addition, myofibers were arranged parallel to the long axis of the muscle, an orientation associated with chronologically younger muscles, suggesting morphological maturation of the soleus muscle had been delayed by suspension. In contrast, radial and longitudinal growth of EDL myofibers were minimally affected under similar conditions and remained within approximately 5% of control at all times. Suspension also influenced the normal changes that occur in satellite cell and myonuclear populations during postnatal growth. Both the number and proliferative activity of satellite cells were severely reduced in individual myofibers after only 3 days in both soleus and EDL muscles. The reduced number of satellite cells within 3 days of initiating hindlimb suspension appeared to be the result of their incorporation into myofibers while the long-lasting reduction appeared to be the added effects of decreased proliferative activity. In the soleus, this reduction in number and proliferation of satellite cells persisted throughout the experimental period and resulted in an overall 43% fewer myonuclei and 45% fewer satellite cells than control at 50 days of age. In contrast, both the total number and mitotic activity of satellite cells in the EDL rapidly returned to weight-bearing control levels by day 10 of suspension, resulting in no overall reduction in myonuclear accretion.\r"

In 5-min isometric maximal voluntary contraction, no decline was seen in the peak amplitude of the tibialis anterior compound muscle mass action potential (M wave) either during or immediately after the voluntary effort, provided maximal nerve stimulation was retained. For first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle, M wave amplitudes declined by 19.4 +/- 1.6% during the first 2 min but did not change significantly thereafter, despite the continued force reduction (up to 94% in 5 min for both muscles). The duration of the FDI M waves increased (greater than 30%), suggesting that the small decline in amplitude was the result of increased dispersion between the responses of different motor units. Some subjects kept FDI maximally activated throughout, but when they used tibialis anterior, twitch occlusion and tetanic muscle stimulation showed that most subjects were usually only able to do so for the first 60 s and thereafter only during brief \"extra efforts.\" Thus force loss during isometric voluntary contractions sustained at the highest intensities results mainly from failure of processes within the muscle fibers.\r"

Samples of blood, plasma, lymph, and lung were obtained up to 180 min after tracer infusion.

Clearance of transferrin and albumin from the plasma space followed a two-compartment model. The clearance rate constant was 2.1 +/- 0.1 x 10(-3) min for albumin and 2.4 +/- 0.1 x 10(-3) min for transferrin (P less than 0.05). Lymph-to-plasma ratios for albumin and transferrin were not different. However, the extravascular-to-plasma ratio for albumin was greater than transferrin (P less than 0.05). The lymph and lung data were deconvoluted for the plasma input function and fit to a two-compartment model. The results indicate that albumin and transferrin have similar permeabilities across the vascular barrier but have different pulmonary circulation to lymph kinetics because the extravascular volume of distribution of albumin is greater than transferrin.\r"

However, in high-speed conditioned rats, HR (+9%), Pa (+7%), and white gastrocnemius muscle (+46%) blood flow were higher than in controls (P less than 0.05). The higher white muscle flow was the result of the higher Pa and lower resistance to flow. These data demonstrate that specific changes in preexercise anticipatory blood flow distribution among muscles occur during exercise conditioning programs and that the changes are dependent on the intensity of the conditioning regimen. The mechanisms responsible for the adaptations are not known.\r"

Six endurance-trained females participated as subjects in this investigation. Each subject underwent three separate experimental trials in which NaHCO3 was ingested in either a single (0.3 g NaHCO3/kg body wt) or periodic schedule (0.12 g NaHCO3/kg body wt initially, with 0.18 g/kg body wt distributed in equal doses before each 5-min exercise bout). Calcium carbonate served as a placebo control. An intermittent exercise protocol was used in which each subject rode a cycle ergometer at 90% maximum O2 consumption for 5 min. Within each acid-base condition, the exercise protocol was repeated three times with 10-min rest periods interspersed. Differentiated ratings of perceived exertion for the legs (RPE-L), chest (RPE-C), and overall body (RPE-O) were attenuated under alkalotic treatment relative to placebo control regardless of pattern of NaHCO3 administration. RPE-L, RPE-C, and RPE-O were negatively correlated to the bicarbonate concentration of venous blood. This investigation suggests that perception of effort during high-intensity intermittent exercise can be related to buffering capacity of the blood.\r"

We measured the rates of glucose production in isolated hepatocytes from iron-sufficient (Fe+) and iron-deficient (Fe-) rats to assess the intrinsic capacity of the Fe- liver to carry out gluconeogenesis. Low-iron and control diets were given to 21-day-old female rats. After 4-5 wk, hemoglobin concentrations averaged 4.1 g/dl in the Fe- and 14.3 g/dl in the Fe+ animals. In the hepatocytes from Fe- rats, there was a 35% decrease in the rate of glucose production from 1 mM pyruvate + 10 mM lactate, a 48% decrease from 0.1 mM pyruvate + 1 mM lactate, a 39% decrease from 1 mM alanine, and a 48% decrease from 1 mM glycerol. The addition of 5 microM norepinephrine or 0.5 microM glucagon to the incubation media produced stimulatory effects on hepatocytes from both Fe- and Fe+ rats, resulting in the maintenance of an average difference of 38% in the rates of gluconeogenesis between the two groups. Studies on isolated liver mitochondria and cytosol revealed alpha-glycerophosphate-cytochrome c reductase and phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxykinase activities to be decreased by 27% in Fe- rats. We conclude that because severe dietary iron deficiency decreases gluconeogenesis in isolated rat hepatocytes, the increased gluconeogenesis demonstrated by Fe- rats in vivo is attributable to increased availability of gluconeogenic substrates and upregulation of the pathway.\r"

The technique utilizes the established correlation of the pattern of backscattered light with morphometric mean linear intercept and is suitable for dynamic studies. We hypothesized that 1) there would be a difference in the timing of stress relaxation or recovery between alveolar septa and the fibromuscular tissue in the alveolar duct that would reveal itself as a temporally changing S/V after a step-volume change and 2) that geometric hysteresis (looping of S/V with volume), as seen with large volume excursion histories, would be similarly present in small tidal volume loops. Our experimental results contradicted both hypotheses. In particular, we found virtually no change in S/V after a step-volume change, even in the presence of substantial stress adaptation. In addition, when geometric hysteresis of small loops was present, it was always in the sense opposite to the geometric hysteresis of large loops. We conclude that 1) there is a functional \"matching\" of the stress-adaptive timing between alveolar septa and ductal mouths and 2) during small volume looping, the stress hysteresis (looping of stress with volume) in the ductal tissue may be larger than that of the septa, including surface tension.\r"

In order to determine the amount of anaerobic energy release during shortlasting exercise we let 17 healthy young males exercise on the ergometer bike to exhaustion. The power during exercise was kept constant and selected to cause exhaustion in approximately 30 s, 1 min, or 2-3 min. The O2 uptake was measured continuously during the exercise, and the anaerobic energy release was quantified by the accumulated O2 deficit. The work done as well as the total energy release rose linearly with the exercise duration and was therefore a sum of a component proportional to time plus a constant addition. The accumulated O2 deficit increased from 1.86 +/- 0.07 (SE) mmol/kg for 30 s exercise to 2.25 +/- 0.06 mmol/kg for 1 min exercise and further to 2.42 +/- 0.08 mmol/kg for exercise lasting 2 min or more (P less than 0.01). The accumulated O2 uptake increased linearly with the duration, and as a consequence of this the relative importance of aerobic processes increased from 40% at 30 s duration to 50% at 1 min duration and further to 65% for exercise lasting 2 min. These results show that both aerobic and anaerobic processes contribute significantly during intense exercise lasting from 30 s to 3 min.\r"

We instilled 100 ml of autologous serum labeled with 125I-albumin into one lung. At the end of 24, 48, 96, or 144 h, the lungs were removed and the residual native protein and 125I-albumin in the air spaces were determined by bronchoalveolar lavage. Also the fraction of the instilled 125I-albumin remaining in the rest of the lung was measured in the lung homogenate. Clearance of the 125I-albumin from the lung into the plasma, lymph, thyroid, urine, and feces was also determined. The removal of both the 125I-albumin and the native protein from the air spaces was slow, following a monoexponential decline. The removal rate of the 125I-albumin from the air spaces was slightly but significantly faster (1.6%/h) than the clearance rate of the native protein (0.9%/h). Clearance of the 125I-albumin from the lung also followed a slow monoexponential decline at a rate of 1.4%/h. At all time periods, 75% of the 125I-albumin remaining in the lung was located in the air spaces, thus indicating that the pulmonary epithelium is the principal barrier to protein clearance from the normal lung. Macrophages appeared to play a minor role in alveolar protein clearance because the quantity of 125I-albumin present in the phagocytic cells in the air spaces was less than 1% of the instilled 125I-albumin at all time periods. However, macrophages may play some role in protein clearance after 48 h because we visualized phagolysosomes in macrophages, and there was an increase in free iodine in lung lavage, urine, thyroid, and feces after 48 h. However, gel electrophoretic studies showed that most of the 125I-albumin was cleared from the lung as an intact molecule, although only 24.7 +/- 4.7% of the 125I-albumin was cleared by the lymphatics.\r"

To observe the behavior of bubbles in the pulmonary circulation, we injected venous air emboli into anesthetized dogs and videotaped their elimination from the pulmonary microcirculation by using in vivo microscopy. Small intravenous bubbles lodged exclusively in pulmonary arterioles and were eliminated from that site. To determine whether the gas was dissolving into nearby blood and then was carried to the capillaries for excretion, the rate of bubble radius change was measured during nonperfused conditions produced by balloon occlusion of lobar blood flow and compared with perfused conditions. Bubble volume decreased at the same rate during perfused and nonperfused conditions and thus was independent of regional blood flow. Molecular diffusion of gas directly across the arteriolar wall into alveolar spaces was the most likely mechanism of elimination because calculations based on the Fick equation for molecular diffusion predict an elimination rate nearly identical with those observed experimentally.\r"

Lung radical levels, measured \"on-line\" using luminol and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence, decreased in proportion to the degree of alveolar hypoxia. Radical levels fell during hypoxia before the onset of pulmonary vasoconstriction and promptly returned to basal levels with restoration of normoxic ventilation. Mild alveolar hypoxia (10% O2), which failed to decrease chemiluminescence, did not trigger pulmonary vasoconstriction. Although chemiluminescence tended to decrease more as the hypoxic response strengthened, there was not a simple correlation between the magnitude of the change in chemiluminescence induced by hypoxia and the strength of the hypoxic pressor response. Normoxic chemiluminescence was largely inhibited by superoxide dismutase but not catalase. Superoxide dismutase also increased normoxic pulmonary vascular tone and the strength of the pressor response to hypoxia and angiotensin II. Thus the predominant activated O2 species in the lung, during normoxia, was the superoxide anion or a closely related substance. Alteration of endogenous radical levels can result in changes in vascular tone. It remains uncertain whether the decrease in lung radical production during hypoxia caused pulmonary vasoconstriction or was merely associated with hypoxic ventilation.\r"

The sensitivity and specificity of enhanced chemiluminescence for superoxide anion (O2-.) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was evaluated in vitro. The effect of media conditions (such as O2 tension, albumin concentration, and sulfhydryl group availability) on luminescence was assessed in vitro. Xanthine-xanthine oxidase (X-XO) primarily produced superoxide anion in vitro. Enhanced chemiluminescence varied directly with the dose of luminescent probe used and the quantity of activated O2 species administered. The strength of the luminescent signal was also dependent on the concentration of albumin and O2 in the media. Lucigenin was more sensitive than luminol to the presence of O2-. and, unlike luminol, lucigenin did not alter radical production by XO. However, neither luminescent probe was specific for O2-., as both detected H2O2 and O2 in vitro. H2O2-induced chemiluminescence was inhibited by catalase but not superoxide dismutase (SOD), while X-XO-induced luminescence was inhibited by SOD but not catalase. SOD-inhibitable chemiluminescence was a sensitive and specific marker for O2-. production in vitro. Once the sensitivity-specificity of enhanced chemiluminescence was defined in vitro, this technique was used to explore the mechanism by which exogenous X-XO reduced hypoxic vasoconstriction in isolated rat lungs. The vascular paresis, caused by administration of X-XO to the rat lung, resulted from a brief burst of O2-. production rather than a sustained alteration of lung radical levels.\r"

To compensate for this, a group of soldiers who did not receive heavy water was followed to measure isotopic base-line changes. Energy expenditure by doubly labeled water was in agreement with intake/balance (3,400 +/- 260 vs. 3,230 +/- 520 kcal/day). The overall coefficient of variation of energy expenditure by doubly labeled water was half that of intake/balance (7.6 vs. 16.1%).

  ".U": "90094117\r", 
  ".W": "To clarify the mechanics of alveolar parenchyma, we undertook a stereological and topological study in perfusion-fixed canine lungs of the borders of alveolar septa. We defined the principal borders as those along which one septum 1) joins two others (J), 2) joins one other at a distinct angle (B), or 3) joins no other structure (E). E and B borders are invariably reinforced with heavy connective tissue cables; J borders are not. Relative net lengths, determined from the number of traces per section area, were J, 45%; E, 19%; and B, 25%. These were remarkably constant over 10 canine lobes (5 animals, 4 volumes). Parenchyma, then, departs from the simple models that comprise only Js and Es. Bs are important; their net length exceeds that of Es. With lobe deflation, E shortened somewhat more than required to maintain geometric similarity, suggesting that the alveolar duct contracted disproportionately. A three-dimensional reconstruction was made from serial sections, and individual border segments were followed through the reconstruction. Typical lengths of individual J, B, and E borders were nearly equal. To characterize how the network of borders were interconnected, we counted the nodes at which they meet by class, e.g., EBE for the meeting of one B, two Es. The most common are JJJJ, 26%; EEEJ, 10%; EBJ, 24%; EBE, 8%; BBJJ, 12%. If parenchyma were constructed only from free-standing entrance rings and septal junctions, only JJJJ and EEEJ would be anticipated. The presence of EBJ, EBE, and BBJJ underscores parenchymal complexity. Only 7% of septa examined were bordered entirely by Js. Connective tissue cables were not confined to the alveolar duct's lumen but often extended to the primary septa at the periphery of the ductal unit. They rarely linked adjacent alveolar ducts; only 1 in 200 cable segments crossed from one duct to another. These observations support the concept that the parenchyma is an elastic network, characterized in part by a serial mechanical linkage from connective tissue cable to septal membrane to cable again.\r"

The frequencies of these four features on light micrographs and the areas of transections through collagen and elastin seen on electron micrographs were combined to give the volumes of collagen and elastin within each feature. We find that E and B have similar compositions and contain most (4/5) of the parenchymal elastin in their relatively heavy cables. The E and B are interconnected and similar in location and composition, and they may constitute a functional entity in which elastin provides tension over a range of lung volumes, opposing septal tensions. In J and W, elastin is typically sparse and fine. Calculations, however, suggest it contributes the dominant portion of septal tension at lower lung volumes. Elastin may be essential to stabilizing septal configuration. Collagen, on the other hand, is distributed relatively evenly throughout E, B, J, and W, consistent with the role of protecting all components against rupture.\r"

Large quantitative differences were observed between Zrs and Zst, demonstrating that the standard method is unreliable at such frequencies. The real part of Zrs increased from 2.6 +/- 0.8 cmH2O.l-1.s at 8 Hz to a maximum of 38 +/- 19 cmH2O.l-1.s at 158 +/- 49 Hz. The imaginary part exhibited a maximum of 19 +/- 8 cmH2O.l-1.s at 126 +/- 38 Hz, a resonance at 157 +/- 43 Hz, and a minimum of lambda 19 +/- 16 cmH2O.l-1.s at 185 +/- 45 Hz. The data were analyzed with five models featuring alveolar gas compressibility; tissue resistance, inertance, and compliance; and different representations of the airways with lumped and distributed parameters. All except the simplest (lumped frequency-dependent resistance) fitted the data equally well, but none provided reliable estimates of gas compliance. Three models gave a consistent description of the airway in terms of equivalent rigid tubes (cross-sectional area 3.5-3.7 cm2, length 47-51 cm). We conclude that high-frequency input impedance could prove useful in exploring the airways but not the peripheral lung.\r"

Air embolism increased pulmonary vascular resistance by 71% and nearly tripled steady-state lung lymph flow, with no change in lymph-to-plasma protein ratio. These findings reflect an increase in lung vascular protein permeability. During sustained lung endothelial injury, diuresis from furosemide led to a rapid reduction in cardiac output (average 29%) and a 2-Torr decrease in left atrial pressure. Diuresis also led to hemoconcentration, with a 15% increase in both plasma and lymph protein concentrations. These changes were associated with a 27% reduction in lung lymph flow. In a second set of studies, we prevented the reduction in left atrial pressure after furosemide by inflating a balloon catheter in the left atrium. Nevertheless, lymph flow decreased by 25%, commensurate with the reduction in cardiac output that occurred after furosemide. In a third series of experiments, we minimized the furosemide-related decrease in cardiac output by opening an external fistula between the carotid artery and jugular vein immediately after injection of furosemide. In these studies, the reduction in lung lymph flow (average 17%) paralleled the smaller (17%) decrease in cardiac output. These results suggest that changes in lung vascular filtration pressure probably do not account for the reduction in lung lymph flow after furosemide in the presence of lung vascular injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These responses to passive leg exercise were also studied in 23 patients with spinal cord transection at the level of T5-T12. In the normal subjects, minute ventilation (VE) increased abruptly from the first breath after the onset of the two types of exercise. In contrast, cardiac output (Q) increased gradually in voluntary exercise, exhibiting significant augmentation from the fifth breath. Q changed insignificantly in passive exercise. In the patients with spinal cord transection, neither VE nor Q changed with passive exercise. These results suggest that ventilatory responses at the onset of mild exercise are related to drives from the moving limbs. We could not detect any evidence to support cardiodynamic hyperpnea at the onset of exercise.\r"

For each lung, the diameters of alveoli and alveolar ducts, as well as the volume fractions of alveoli, alveolar ducts, and airways, were determined as parameters providing the best fit. Parameter values were alveolar diameter = 0.116 +/- 0.007 (SE) mm, alveolar duct diameter = 0.284 +/- 0.015 mm, total alveolar volume/total lung capacity (TLC) = 0.68 +/- 0.02, total alveolar duct volume/TLC = 0.24 +/- 0.02, and total airway volume/TLC = 0.09 +/- 0.01. These values agreed with published values for linear dimensions and volumetric fractions in the canine lung. The mean alveolar diameter determined by the model in the nine lungs agreed closely with a mean value of 0.115 +/- 0.002 mm determined by morphometric analysis of photographs of the subpleural alveoli in the same lungs. The procedure of fitting the model to experimental data appears to have promise as a noninvasive probe of the lung periphery. However, aerosol-derived dimensions were more variable than morphometric ones, possibly because of interlung differences in aerosol distribution not accounted for in the model.\r"

Hindlimb vascular responses to isoproterenol were compared in eight controls and eight of the dogs with heart failure. In dogs with heart failure, the density of beta-receptors on skeletal muscle was reduced in both gastrocnemius (control: 50 +/- 5; heart failure: 33 +/- 8 fmol/mg of protein) and semitendinosus muscle (control: 43 +/- 9; heart failure: 27 +/- 9 fmol/mg of protein, both P less than 0.05). Receptor coupling to the ternary complex, as determined by isoproterenol competition curves with and without guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP), was unchanged. Isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was significantly decreased in semitendinosus muscle (control: 52.4 +/- 4.6; heart failure: 36.5 +/- 9.5 pmol.mg-1.min-1; P less than 0.05) and tended to be decreased in gastrocnemius muscle (control: 40.1 +/- 8.5; heart failure: 33.5 +/- 4.5 pmol.mg-1.min-1; P = NS). Isoproterenol-induced hindlimb vasodilation was not significantly different in controls and in dogs with heart failure. These findings suggest that heart failure causes downregulation of skeletal muscle beta-adrenergic receptors, probably due to receptor exposure to elevated catecholamine levels, but does not reduce beta-receptor-mediated vasodilation in muscle.\r"

To determine permeability, tracers of different molecular weights were applied simultaneously on a chromatography column containing confluent endothelial cells cultured on porous microcarrier beads. The Sangren-Sheppard model was used to determine the permeability of the endothelial monolayer from the tracer elution profiles. For six radiolabeled tracers the mean (+/- SD) permeabilities (cm/s x 10(-5)) in order of increasing tracer molecular weight were [3H]water, 82.0 +/- 28.8; [14C]urea, 49.5 +/- 9.5; [14C]mannitol, 13.3 +/- 4.7; [14C]-sucrose, 14.1 +/- 2.5; [3H]polyethylene glycol (900 mol wt), 4.80 +/- 1.61; and [3H]polyethylene glycol (4,000 mol wt), 1.97 +/- 1.01. These permeabilities deviate less from in vivo values than those obtained in other in vitro systems and are 10 times higher than in vivo estimates. The values were reproducible for up to the 4 h tested. Modulation of endothelial monolayer permeability was studied in a separate series of experiments. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10(-6) M) decreased the permeability to mannitol by 36% and to polyethylene glycol (900 mol wt) by 49%; in both instances the decrease in permeability was reversed by propranolol. Propranolol alone had no effect. Dibutyryl cAMP (10(-3) M) decreased the permeability to mannitol by 40% and to polyethylene glycol by 47%; permeability returned to base line when dibutyryl cAMP was removed. Cytochalasin D (1 microgram/ml) increased permeability by 350% for mannitol and 380% for polyethylene glycol; the permeability change was reversed after removal of cytochalasin D. The results indicate that cell-column chromatography is a powerful method that can be used to characterize the permeability of endothelial monolayers and to investigate permeability changes produced by various agents.\r"

In the control plantaris 88% of the motor units were classified as fast. After overload, a large decline (26.5%) in the proportion of typical fast motor units was noted. The estimated contribution of fast fatigable units to whole muscle tetanic tension (Po 200) also declined (from 55 to 25%), whereas that of fast intermediate motor units increased (from 33 to 55%). In the overloaded plantaris, motor units that exhibited unusual \"sag\" and contraction time characteristics were detected. These motor units, which could be further subdivided into two distinct types by a variety of indexes, exhibited characteristics intermediate to fast and slow units and therefore were termed \"transitional.\" Transitional units accounted for 12% of the estimated whole muscle Po200 after overload. These experiments characterize novel classifications of motor units undergoing transformation and further detail the motor unit shift that accompanies compensatory overload.\r"

Because both clearance measurements were made in similar conditions of pulmonary blood flow, respiratory rate, and tidal volume, changes in clearance rate can be assumed to represent changes of alveolar epithelial permeability. After exercise, total, apical, and basal clearance were significantly increased (P less than 0.01, 0.05, and 0.05, respectively) and the increases in total clearance and tidal volume observed during exercise were significantly correlated (P less than 0.05). In contrast, no significant change was found in pulmonary mechanics. These results show that prolonged intensive exercise induces an increase in epithelial permeability, which appears to be related to the mechanical effects of sustained increased ventilation. Because no change was evidenced in pulmonary volumes or in lung elasticity, our results suggest that this increase may result from alteration of the intercellular tight junctions rather than from a surfactant deficiency.\r"

Thoroughbred horses were run at maximal O2 uptake on a high-speed treadmill until fatigued. Muscle temperatures and biopsy samples were collected at rest, immediately after exercise, and 30 and 60 min after exercise. Blood samples were collected at rest and 5 min after exercise. Muscle and blood (lactate concentration) were three- and fivefold greater than pre-exercise values. Muscle temperature and pH immediately after post-exercise were 43 degrees C and 6.55, respectively, but approached rest values by 60 min after exercise. The initial rate and maximal capacity of Ca2+ uptake of muscle homogenates and isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum were significantly depressed immediately after exercise. This depression was paralleled by decreased activity of the Ca2+-stimulated ATPase. However, both Ca2+ uptake (rate and capacity) and Ca2+4-ATPase activity had returned to normal by 60 min after exercise. These findings demonstrate that changes in sarcoplasmic reticulum function after high-intensity exercise may be induced but not sustained by local changes in muscle pH and/or temperature.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanical responses and changes in membrane potential induced by Na removal were investigated in dog tracheal and bronchiolar smooth muscles. In both muscles, reduction of the external Na concentration ([Na]o) to less than 70 mM produced a sustained contracture, dose dependently. The relative amplitude of the Na-free contracture was greater than that induced by excess [K]o in the trachealis. Readmission of 1-10 mM Na, after exposure to Na-free solution, relaxed the contracture evoked by Na removal, and the degree of relaxation was dependent on [Na] readmitted. In the absence of both Na and Ca, some tension remained, and readmission of Ca increased the muscle tone. Even after pretreatment with Ca-free ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethylether)-N,N,N,N'-tetraacetic acid- (0.2 mM) containing solution for 30 min, removal of Na caused some mechanical response in both muscles. D 600 (10(-7) to 10(-4) M), a blocker of voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx, suppressed the response to Na removal, but 10(-4) M D 600 did not completely block the contracture. Na removal depolarized the smooth muscle membrane to a greater extent in the bronchiole than in the trachealis. It was concluded that an increase in Ca permeability across the membrane and inhibition of the Na-Ca exchange mechanism in the absence of Na are responsible for the generation of Na-free contracture in both muscles.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine at what age children develop a breathing strategy that is relaxed, i.e., determined by the mechanical characteristics of the lung and chest wall. Forty studies were performed in 27 healthy infants and children aged 1 mo to 8 yr during natural sleep. Volume changes were recorded with the use of respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP). The volume signal was differentiated to yield flow. Flow-volume representations were generated for a random sample of the recorded breaths to determine the predominant breathing strategy utilized, i.e., relaxed, interrupted, or indeterminate. The respiratory pattern was predominantly interrupted below 6 mo of age and predominantly relaxed over 1 yr of age. Mixed patterns were observed in children 6-12 mo of age. The number of breaths that could not be classified (indeterminate) decreased with age. Respiratory frequency measured from the sample of breaths decreased with age and was accompanied by an increase in expiratory time. We conclude that a relaxed EEV develops at the end of the first year of life and may be related to changes in the mechanical properties of the chest wall associated with growth as well as changes in respiratory timing.\r"

Rib cage and abdominal outputs were present at approximately equal gains and summed to obtain an estimate of volume. Flow-volume curves were generated from the uncalibrated volume signal and its flow derivative. Expiratory time constants (tau) were obtained by visually drawing a line through the linear portion of the expiratory flow-volume relationship. tau increased significantly during the first 10 mo of life. After 10 mo, the estimated rate of increase of tau for older children was less than 5% of the estimated initial rate and not significantly different from zero. Prolongation of tau was paralleled by an increase in expiratory time (Te), and no changes in Te/tau were observed in the first 2 yr of life. These changes in tau likely reflect the increase in lung compliance induced by rapid alveolar growth during infancy. After the first year, expiratory time constants appear to remain relatively constant and may be consistent with balanced changes in compliance and resistance beyond infancy.\r"

To eliminate effects due to the anesthetic choice, dogs were reexamined under pentobarbital. Stimuli were applied to the isolated carotid sinus (CS) of both animals within a single respiratory phase. The stimuli were either steps triggered after one of four delays (5, 25, 50, and 75% of the control phase duration) and terminated at the end of the phase or pulses lasting 300-500 ms. In cats, 80-mmHg steps during inspiration shortened inspiratory duration by 23.2*, 25.0*, 20.4*, and 4.1% (*P less than 0.01) at the above four delays, respectively; inspired volume decreased by 21.4*, 18.0*, 8.0*, and 2.2%. Steps during expiration lengthened expiration by 38.4*, 37.1*, 21.9*, and 3.4%; expired volume changed less than 4%. Qualitatively, similar responses were obtained with steps 40 mmHg in amplitude. In dogs, 40-mmHg stimuli lengthened both inspiration (by 12.8*, 8.9*, -1.2, and -2.5%) and expiration (by 75.2*, 57.9*, 54.0*, and 61.4*%) but tidal volume did not change. Similar differences were observed when pulses were used. Selective baroreceptor denervation in the cat and occipital arterial occlusion in the dog confirmed that the responses were not chemoreceptor mediated. We conclude that although CS baroreceptor activity inhibits ventilation in both cats and dogs, the pattern of the responses is strongly species dependent.\r"

SO2 of arterial and mixed venous blood samples were measured with the Instrumentation Laboratory 282 CO-oximeter (CO-OX), the Radiometer ABL-300 (ABL), and the Lex-O2-Con-K (LEX). Noninvasive measurements of arterial SO2 were made with a Hewlett-Packard 47201A ear oximeter (EAR-OX).

The costal margins were secured and connected to three force transducers. Muscle shortening was measured by sonomicrometry. The presence of arterial collaterals between the left hemidiaphragm and the systemic circulation was excluded by the systemic injection of a vital dye (Lissamine Green), a neuromuscular blocking agent (succinylcholine), and by the injection of epinephrine. Left phrenic nerve stimulation produced homogeneous shortening and tension. The degree of shortening in the isolated and intact left diaphragm at the same resting length was similar. The preparation was stable for 2 h with less than 10% decline in maximum tension. Two advantages of this preparation are particularly important. 1) Diaphragmatic energetics can be studied independently of systemic factors, and 2) the role of phrenic nerve afferents in the control of breathing and systemic circulation can easily be assessed without activating nonphrenic nerve afferents.\r"

Therefore the responses of isolated guinea pig pulmonary venules to hypoxia (bath PO2, 25 Torr) and anoxia (bath PO2, 0 Torr) were characterized. Pulmonary venules [effective lumen radius (ELR), 116 +/- 2 microns] with an adherent layer of parenchyma responded to hypoxia and anoxia with a graded sustained contraction (hypoxia, 0.03 +/- 0.01; anoxia, 0.26 +/- 0.03 mN/mm), whereas paired femoral venules (ELR, 184 +/- 7 microns) contracted to anoxia only (0.05 +/- 0.02 mN/mm). Repeated challenges with hypoxia and anoxia continued to elicit sustained pulmonary venular contractions; femoral venule contractions to anoxia were not repeatable. Hypoxia- and anoxia-induced pulmonary venular contractions were calcium and pH dependent. Dissection of the parenchyma from pulmonary venules did not alter contractions to decreased PO2. Anoxic contractions of pulmonary venules were variably reduced by replacement of the bath fluid; however, the release of a contractile mediator(s) from pulmonary venules during hypoxia or anoxia was not demonstrated. Pulmonary venular responses to hypoxia and anoxia are similar to those induced by hypoxia in vivo, and results obtained from this model may be useful in predicting mechanisms of HPV.\r"

Two groups of rats were exposed to Ta of 32.4 degrees C all day for 5 (HC5) or 10 (HC10) days. The other four groups were exposed to Ta of 32.8 degrees C for 5 h/day during the last half of the dark phase for 5 (NI5) or 10 (NI10) consecutive days or during the last half of the light phase for 5 (DI5) or 10 (DI10) consecutive days. Control rats (C) were kept at 23.8 degrees C throughout the experiment. Hypothalamic temperature (Thy) was measured every 5 min with a chronically implanted thermocouple from 1 day before the beginning to 2 days after the end of the heat acclimation periods. During the heat acclimation periods, daily mean Thy rose significantly in HC5 and HC10 rats but decreased significantly in NI5 and NI10 rats. Daily mean Thy did not change in C, DI5, and DI10 rats. Thy in HC10 rats sharply decreased at the end of the heat acclimation periods and remained at low levels for approximately 3 h. On the 2nd postacclimation day, however, mean Thy returned and remained at a significantly higher level. In NI10 rats, the mean Thy in the postacclimation period was significantly lower than the preacclimation values. No such changes in mean Thy were observed in DI10 rats. Five-days of heat exposure had little effect on the postacclimation Thy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The time required to grow sufficient human keratinocytes for grafting is a major limitation of this technique. Three variables--plating density, length of time to confluence in secondary culture, and media supplementation--were studied to find conditions that increase the rate of keratinocyte growth. Normal human keratinocytes were used for all studies. Plating densities varied between 2.5 x 10(3) and 3.7 x 10(4) cells per square centimeter. Time in secondary culture was studied daily from day 2 to day 17. Media supplements included fetal bovine serum, human serum, and three commercially available serum supplements. These studies indicate that human keratinocytes, grown for wound grafting, can grow more rapidly to a higher cell number if they are plated at a density of 2 x 10(4) cells per square centimeter, passaged by 8 to 10 days or before confluence slows cell growth, and grown in 5% fetal bovine serum, 1.25% fetal bovine serum, or 5% human serum. Use of these techniques may decrease the time necessary for wound coverage with human keratinocytes.\r"

Nine paired wounds in four patients with large burns were used in this study. When Biobrane temporary wound dressing adhered to a wound, epithelial migration did not proceed until it was removed. Although wounds covered with homograft immediately had the appearance of healed wounds, biopsy specimens showed evidence of a delay in epithelial migration. Although these results indicate impaired epithelial migration with the use of both materials, we concluded that homograft offered an advantage because the wounds that were covered with it remained closed during the entire reepithelialization process.\r"

The dPGE was found to increase gut translocation of bacteria. Administration of dPGE had no significant effect on resting metabolic rate. In rats with nonseptic burns the administration of dPGE resulted in increased serum levels of acute-phase proteins. In conclusion prostaglandin E may have both detrimental and beneficial effects on traumatized persons.\r"

Response of heat production to displacement of POAH temperature was determined for control animals and animals with burns (31% +/- 3% total body surface area). At an ambient temperature of 22 degrees C there was a significant increase in thermosensitivity of the POAH for both control rats and rats with burns compared with thermosensitivity at 32 degrees C. Within ambient temperatures there was no effect on thermosensitivity detected for rats with burns compared with control rats. The threshold temperature for heat production was shifted significantly upward (p less than 0.05) both by a lower ambient temperature and by burn injury. The reference temperature for heat production was also shifted to the right by burn injury (p less than 0.05). The significant shifts to the right for threshold temperature and reference temperature for heat production enhance the organisms's ability to meet the stress of the hypermetabolic response. At a warm ambient temperature (32 degrees C) there are no significant differences in thermoregulation detected in animals with burns or control animals.\r"

The administration of morphine sulfate to normal mice resulted in decreased delayed-type hypersensitivity response. This morphine sulfate-induced immunosuppression was prevented by concurrent treatment with the opioid antagonist, naloxone; however, naloxone alone did not alter immune response. Thermally injured mice had a suppressed delayed-type hypersensitivity response that was not further affected by morphine sulfate administration. In contrast, the immunosuppressive effects caused by burn injury, alone or in combination with the administration of morphine sulfate, were not observed in the presence of naloxone as measured by delayed-type hypersensitivity response. These results suggest that opioids depress cellular immune response and may play a role in immune dysfunction that follows thermal injury.\r"

Excised branches studied in vitro were compared with branches heated in situ with an intact blood supply. The potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 5 mM) was applied topically to the heated segments at intervals after injury. The amplitude of the compound action potential was restored to the control level in all preparations treated within 10 minutes after the induction of conduction block. The reversal appeared to be more rapid in the in vivo preparations, and it persisted for at least 60 minutes. The data suggest that paranodal potassium channel exposure may accompany direct thermal injury to the peripheral nerve.\r"

Wounds do not require any sutures or pressure dressings in the immediate postoperative period. Grafts demonstrate excellent take with minimal postoperative care.

Therefore we examined the susceptibility to nystatin of 165 clinical isolates, both gram-positive and gram-negative, to nystatin combined with Silvadene or Sulfamylon and 144 isolates to nystatin and Furacin. Both Silvadene and Furacin combined with nystatin were equally effective against the microorganisms as were the individual drugs. Conversely, Sulfamylon combined with nystatin lost its antimicrobial capability (93.3% resistance, p less than 0.001). On the basis of the in vitro results, 93 patients with acute burns were treated with the appropriate topical antimicrobials from April 1988 to September 1988. Of the 93 patients treated, 90 had neither a major systemic bacterial nor a Candida sepsis, and none of these patients had associated localized burn wound sepsis during their hospital stays. These 90 patients were discharged without any documented signs of infection. The average burnsize was greater than or equal to 29.44% total body surface area. These data suggest that the antimicrobial properties of nystatin, when combined with Silvadene and Furacin, remain effective. Consequently, such combinations have been effective in controlling both local and systemic Candida and bacterial burn wound sepsis.\r"

Statistically significant increases in donor-site infections occurred when patients did not receive perioperative antibiotics, when the excision was large, and when the time between injury and excision was prolonged. Age, burn size, or type of dressing did not influence the development of infections. A risk of graft infections in those patients who were not receiving perioperative antibiotics existed, but it was not significant.

Deep touch sensation was intact over both grafted and ungrafted areas in all patients. Loss of sensation was not related to patient age, burn size, or type of burn; nor did sensory loss correlate with the impairment rating received. Depth of burn injury appears to be the best predictor of altered sensation, and some abnormalities in patients appear inevitable after skin grafting. Patients should be counseled about possible outcomes. However, the decrease in sensation that was observed rarely contributed significantly to the long-term impairment rating of these burn victims.\r"

A total of 59 treatments were performed on 14 patients who had limited unilateral or bilateral shoulder motion. A significant gain in shoulder ROM was attained when this treatment was performed and resulted in an increase in shoulder ROM when the patient was alert after anesthesia compared with preanesthesia measurements.\r"

Serial casting was used to increase the range of motion in 35 joints in 15 patients with burns. A mean increase of 54% was achieved. Casting provided immediate results with minimal complications and was accepted well by patients. Casts were easy to apply and effective even with noncompliant patients. They also delayed or eliminated the need for surgical correction.\r"

Using its color capabilities, we have created a picture database of patients' injuries, radiographs, and other relevant clinical data. The computer-based imaging system allows instant access to this information and minimizes subjective evaluation, making comparison of and follow-up of treatments more objective. The image analysis components permit digital characterization of the burn wound, enhancing our ability to quantitatively evaluate wound size, contracture, graft take, and re-epithelialization. This is a cost-effective method of handling information and images in the clinical setting as well as an effective research and teaching tool that facilitates management and follow-up care of the patient with burns.\r"

The changed body necessitates concomitant alteration of the internal self-image, including feelings about the internal self or self-esteem. Six children of primary school age are being followed up in a prospective, longitudinal study to track their adaptation to burn disfigurement. Results of the first 5 1/2 years reveal that, initially, all children displayed pervasive developmental regression, accompanied by phobias, nightmares, and various other symptoms. Two years later, one half of the children had returned to the average range of development attainment. By the fifth year, five of the six children had returned to an average level of progressive personality development. The sixth child was progressing well considering cognitive and emotional deficits before the burn injury. A primary factor influencing adaptation appeared to be the role of the parent or parents in facilitating the acquisition of a positive self-image and in launching and maintaining active mastery in their children.\r"

Periodically, the ABA should verify that the burn care facilities identified in the disaster plan meet its standards. Once the burn disaster system is developed, drills should be held locally on a regular basis and nationally on an annual basis.\r"

Airway obstruction is an uncommon problem after most carotid surgery and has not been described for patients with cervical irradiation. Airway obstruction developed after two of five carotid endarterectomy procedures in previously irradiated necks requiring emergency tracheostomy or reintubation. Mechanisms of obstruction included endotracheal tube trauma to the fixed irradiated vocal cords and laryngeal edema caused by surgical dissection in an irradiated field. In addition, one patient in our series demonstrated hypercarbia as a result of bilateral carotid body ablation, a process known to impair the ventilatory response to hypoxia. An increased risk of airway obstruction after carotid surgery exists in patients with prior cervical irradiation. Preventive methods include the use of perioperative steroids and either carotid surgery with local anesthesia or bronchoscopic vocal cord visualization and intubation.\r"

Only 13 of 24 biopsy positive patients had clinical arterial abnormalities; 5 of 8 biopsy negative patients had clinical abnormalities. Three biopsy positive patients had an ESR of less than 40 mm/hr. The average delay from onset of symptoms to biopsy was 128 days; excluding 3 patients with a delay greater than 6 months, the average delay was 52 days. The average time to diagnosis in the \"no biopsy\" group from the onset of symptoms was 60 days (excluding 1 patient with a delay greater than 6 months). Serious complications occurred in 15 patients. Of 36 patients undergoing biopsy, 4 had complications (prior to biopsy), whilst of the 30 \"no biopsy\" patients 11 suffered a serious complication (significant chi 2 = 4,716 with Yates correction, p less than 0.05). The study suggests that diagnosis is delayed in all groups. Earlier biopsies in more patients with meticulous technique would probably speed the diagnosis of cranial arteritis and reduce the incidence of preventable complications.\r"

In 18 patients, surgery for recoarctation was necessary using aortoplasty and a prosthetic patch technique. There were no postoperative complications or deaths in these patients. So far, in 2 cases with a prosthetic patch, aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta adjacent to the patch has developed.\r"

All grafts were patent at the time of harvesting. The thickness of pseudointima plateaued at 10 weeks. There was no demonstrable discrepancy in thickness between grafts (cell 72 +/- 13). The luminal cells were modified myofibroblasts that contained short microvilli, gap junctions, myofilament, and incomplete basal laminae. The pseudointima consisted of an interlamination of myofibroblasts alternating with extracellular matrix of collagen and ground substances. It was more cellular near the lumen and more fibrocollagenous near the graft. Myofibroblasts were found near the lumen and fibroblasts near the graft. Macrophages, vasa vasorum, leukocytes and fibroblasts occupied the interstitial space between the graft fibrils. Similar cellular and extracellular composition existed in the three types of grafts. There was no local inflammatory reaction encountered in the Gelseal treated graft. Gelseal, crimped and noncrimped knitted Dacron grafts had pseudointima of comparable architecture, thickness, cellular and noncellular composition. Gelseal did not hinder pseudointima formation or induce local inflammatory reaction.\r"

In both materials, hyperplasia occurred to a significantly greater degree at the distal or downstream anastomosis as compared with the proximal or upstream anastomosis (Dacron P less than 0.001, PTFE P less than 0.05). Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of these two commonly used but different arterial grafts did not demonstrate a significant difference in the occurrence of anastomotic hyperplasia.\r"

The obtained set of characteristics was used for the prediction of postoperative arterial pressure values by means of one of the methods of mathematical statistics, the regression analysis in an \"SM-4\" electronic computer according to a specially created multivariate regression program in the \"Fortran-4\" language. The high accuracy of predicting the arterial pressure by this method was confirmed by clinical trials. Forecasting postoperative arterial pressure by this method allows us to substantiate with a high degree of fidelity the advisability of reconstructive surgery and opens up realistic prospects for improving its results.\r"

Distribution of arterial blood flow was analyzed by injection of radiolabeled microspheres. Electromagnetically measured femoral arterial blood flow was 92 +/- 10 ml/min during control, and increased significantly (p less than 0.05) to 254 +/- 94 ml/min during reperfusion.

  ".W": "To investigate the correlation between blood flow rate and shear stress variation (tau-variation), the integral of time differential of wall shear stress in one cardiac cycle and the outcome of the vein graft, 42 consecutive patients with femoropopliteal autovein grafts (24 in situ and 18 reversed grafts) were followed for 3 months to 5 years after surgical repair. No correlation was noted between the intraoperative blood flow rate and the outcome of the vein grafts with either procedure. In contrast, the tau-variation value of the vein grafts was closely related to their outcome with both procedures. The higher the tau-variation, the better the long-term results. Vein grafts with a tau-variation of over 60 dyn/cm2 showed good long-term results. The in situ grafts tended to have a higher tau-variation than the reversed grafts (67% in the in situ grafts vs 39% in the reversed grafts). Late failures were noted in vein grafts with low tau-variation value within 3 years after surgery. We recommend the in situ graft technique for patients undergoing femoropopliteal reconstruction, with careful follow-up in cases of vein grafts with a low tau-variation value.\r"

Thirty-nine dogs underwent infrarenal vena cava replacement by 10 cm lengths of 8 mm I.D. ringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Thirty-one grafts were seeded with 1-1.5 x 10(6) porcine aortic endothelial cells while eight were not (GIII). Of the seeded group, 16 animals received no ASA (GI), while 15 others (GII) were given ASA (325 mg) daily starting two days preoperatively and continuing until sacrifice. Venograms were performed on the fourth postoperative day. Grafts were harvested 32 days after insertion and evaluated for patency rate and endothelialized surfaces. The 32-day patency rate was significantly higher for GII than for GI and III animals (67% vs. 13 and 25% respectively). Endothelialized surface was higher in GII than Gi and III (67% vs. 16% and 18% respectively). We conclude that endothelial cell seeding alone does not prevent graft closure and that a combination of ASA and cell seeding significantly increases the patency rate of vena cava grafts.\r"

In that case, traction injury of the artery remote from the surgical field is likely. Commonly this affects a proximal segment of the artery but it can occur at a distal fixed point also.

  ".W": "During a 5 year period (January 1979-December 1983) 357 patients were submitted to mitral valve replacement. These were performed by the same surgeon and were randomized in 2 groups: Group A consisted of 179 patients who received a St Jude Medical (SJM) prosthesis in the mitral position. Group B comprised 178 patients with a Bjork-Shiley valve (BSM) initially (113 patients from 1979 to December 1981 matched with 111 SJM) and later a Starr-Edwards 6120 valve prosthesis (65 patients matched with 63 SJM). Analysis of 21 preoperative clinical, hemodynamic data and operative variables showed the groups to be well randomized. All patients were anticoagulated postoperatively. A follow-up study was performed each year postop: at the end of 1986 there was a 35 to 95 months follow-up with a mean of 64.7 months (1596 patient years follow-up). Fifteen patients were lost to follow-up. There were 8.4% deaths related to the prosthesis in group A and 20.2% in group B (p less than 0.001). The difference was due mainly to deaths from thromboembolic complications and sudden deaths. The rate of peripheral arterial embolic complications was 2.3% in group A and 4.3% in group B per patient year (NS). The difference between the 2 groups is significant for all thromboembolic events including sudden deaths: 3.1% in group A and 7.9% per patient year in group B (p less than 0.001). There were no statistical differences in the rates of endocarditis per patient year (0.3% in group A, 0.9% in group B), reoperation (0.75% in group A, 0.89% in group B), or anticoagulant related hemorrhage (1.6% in group A, 2.4% in group B). Actuarial survival rate, including all postoperative deaths, is significantly different (p less than 0.05) at 5 years, 87.6% +/- 4.5 (group A) versus 77.4% +/- 6 (group B) and at 7 years follow-up, 83.4% +/- 6.5 (group A) versus 73.2% +/- 7.2 (group B). The probability of freedom from death and complications related to the prosthesis is significantly different (p less than 0.001) at 5 years postoperatively: 79% +/- 6.5 for group A versus 54% +/- 7.5 for group B and at 7 years: 72% +/- 7.5 (group A) versus 46% +/- 8.5 (group B). Comparison of subgroups, 113 BSM versus 111 SJM (1979-81) and 65 SE 6120 versus 63 SJM (1982-83) showed similar significant differences in the results: however there were more early deaths, valve thrombosis, valve dysfunctions and sudden late deaths in the BSM group and more peripheral arterial emboli in the SE 6120 group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Eleven patients (3.9%) presented 6-41 months after surgery with prosthetic valve dysfunction due to thrombosis. Inadequate control of anticoagulation was the major factor predisposing to thrombosis in all except one. All patients had documented rheumatic valvular disease. Nine patients were operated on an emergency basis and two died before any surgical intervention was possible. Thrombectomy was performed on six patients with four survivors and MVR in three with two survivors. Two patients died intraoperatively (22%). Three pregnant patients underwent mechanical declotting; pregnancy was terminated by abortion in 2 and by caesarean section and live birth in one. We conclude that implantation of the BS mitral valve prosthesis mandates emphasis on anticoagulation and the difficulty encountered with continuous anticoagulant therapy in pregnancy.\r"

Preoperative, operative and postoperative data were analyzed. There was no significant difference between the mortality and morbidity of the two groups. Morbidity was evaluated according to several parameters, low cardiac output, prolonged ventilation, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attacks, pulmonary problems, psychosis, renal failure, wound problems and reoperations. Because this is a limited experience it may be premature to conclude than older patients can be operated on as safely as their young counterparts, but this study shows that age is not in itself a risk factor.\r"

In 8 patients (mean age 60, SD = 7.8) before cardiopulmonary bypass, segments of saphenous vein were harvested, and following hydraulic distension (760 mmHg x 10 min), stripped of adventitia, de-endothelialized, cannulated, immersed in oxygenated Krebs solution pH 7.4 37 deg C, and pressurized (100 mmHg) with 4% 125I-albumin-Evans blue for two hours. The samples were then frozen, and serially sectioned in the plane of the lumenal surface. The radioactivity of the 20 microns-thick sections was then determined, and expressed as a tissue: labelled solution concentration ratio (cpm unit volume wet tissue/cpm unit volume labelled solution). Distended portions had a higher mean transmural concentration ratio, as compared with the undistended portion; the ratio distended/undistended was 1.23, SD = 0.17, n = 8, p less than 0.01 (paired t test). This suggests alteration in the transport properties of vein interstitium by hypertension. Random histologic examination of native veins revealed no structural damage apart from age-related dystrophy of elastic fibres and intimal and medial fibrosis in grossly normal veins. These results suggest that the quality of the vein used, combined with hypertension during its preparation, may be factors in the genesis of postoperative graft failure.\r"

We have studied properties of vein interstitium, before and after peroperative distension, in 30 consecutive unselected patients. Segments of vein were studied for water content, swelling behaviour, tracer distribution, and uronic acid content. Initial water content was the same in distended and undistended vein; initial uronic acid content was slightly lower in distended veins, 8.7 (SD = 2.3) micrograms/m, n = 4 vs 10.5 (SD = 5.1) micrograms/mg dry weight, n = 6, not significant. The initial ratio, uronate/hydroxyproline was less in distended veins, 0.14 (SD = 0.05) n = 4 vs 0.19 (SD = 0.07), n = 6 in controls, not significant. Distended veins swelled less during incubation in saline. Average weight gain/initial weight was 0.65 (SD = 0.45), n = 27, and 1.1 (SD = 0.66), n = 25 in controls (p less than 0.01); change in water content/dry weight was 1.2 (SD = 1.1), n = 22, and 1.7 (SD = 1), n = 23 (p less than 0.02), in controls.

The pattern of uptake of two tracers 125I Serum albumin and 51Cr EDTA, was similar in both groups. These findings suggest alteration of the interstitial matrix of veins during distension.

The level of cathepsin-D was higher in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase (P less than 0.01), suggesting increased accumulation by progesterone. Induction by progestin was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of cathepsin-D from a lysate of epithelial endometrial cells previously treated in primary culture with R5020 (10 nM); estradiol (10 nM) had no effect. Immunohistochemistry showed that cathepsin-D is mainly localized in the epithelium and that its level is higher in the luteal phase. The plasma level of cathepsin-D was stable during the menstrual cycle, ranging between 2.5-10 pmol/mL, but increased slightly during pregnancy. The mean level of cathepsin-D was higher in 19 endometrial carcinoma than in 20 normal endometrium, but was not correlated with steroid receptor status. However, using 15 pmol/mg protein as a cut-off level, the cathepsin-D status (high or low) was correlated with the degree of myometrial invasion (greater than or equal to one third) by adenocarcinoma cells, whereas steroid receptor status was not. We conclude that cathepsin-D is induced by progesterone in human endometrium, as it is in normal rat uterus, and we suggest that a low concentration of cathepsin-D in the cytosol of endometrial adenocarcinoma may indicate a favorable prognosis, since it is correlated with low myometrial invasion.\r"

During the first year of treatment height velocity increased significantly (P less than 0.001) in both groups, to 7.5 +/- 1.3 and 8.1 +/- 1.6 cm/yr, respectively. The difference between the two groups was not significant. The mean (+/- SD) height velocity expressed as the SD score for chronological age (Turner references) was 0.0 +/- 1.2 for group I and 0.2 +/- 1.4 for group II and increased significantly (P less than 0.001) during the first year of treatment to +4.3 +/- 1.1 in group I and +5.4 +/- 1.2 in group II. The difference between both groups was statistically significant (P less than 0.01). Height SD score for chronological age (Turner references) increased from -0.2 +/- 0.9 to +0.6 +/- 1.0 in group I and from -0.2 +/- 1.0 to +0.7 +/- 1.1 in group II. Mean bone age progressed similarly in both treatment groups (1.1 +/- 0.6 yr during 1 yr of treatment). However, bone age maturation accelerated more rapidly in younger patients. Twelve girls (three in group I and nine in group II) had minor breast development. No major adverse effects were reported. We conclude that daily sc therapy with hGH stimulates height velocity in Turner's syndrome. The beneficial effect on height velocity increment of E2 addition was small. Furthermore, even very low doses of E2 may induce breast development at an early age and accelerate bone maturation. For these reasons, the addition of E2 to hGH is not warranted in young patients with Turner's syndrome.\r"

DNA synthesis was evaluated by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. After 48-h incubation in Ham's F-12 serum-free medium, chrondrocytes were incubated with or without DHT (10(-11)-10(-8) M) or T (10(-11)-10(-8) M) in MCDB-104 serum-free medium for a further 48 h, with the addition of [3H]thymidine (5 microCi/mL) for the last 24 h. In chondrocytes from five male fetuses (12-40 weeks' gestation) DHT and T significantly stimulated DNA synthesis. The maximum stimulatory effect was obtained for DHT at 10(-10) M (P less than 0.01) and for T at 10(-6) M (P less than 0.02). In chondrocytes from four female fetuses the stimulatory effect was significant only for DHT and was maximum at 10(-10) M (P less than 0.02), whereas no effect was observed for T. Cultured chondrocytes from both male and female fetuses show the presence of proteins with high affinity and limited binding capacity (Bmax) for DHT (male fetuses: Bmax, 4.9 +/- 1.9 x 10(-15) M/mg protein; Kd, 0.43 +/- 0.24 x 10(-9) M; female fetuses: Bmax, 4.8 +/- 1.6 x 10(-15) M/mg protein; Kd, 0.63 +/- 0.19 x 10(-9) M) with no significant differences between sexes. In conclusion, our results show that androgens elicit a biological response in cultured human fetal epiphyseal chondrocytes and that DHT-binding sites are present in these cells. DHT, rather than T, seems to be the active androgen. A sex difference in the degree of androgen action is also documented.\r"

We investigated whether two families of peptides, calcitonin (CT) and somatostatin, posses human monocyte chemotactic activity. CT-related peptides induce a significant chemotactic response, and the potency order is: salmon CT greater than human CT greater than CT much greater than carbo-CT; CT gene-related peptide is completely inactive. This rank potency order differs from that in other systems (e.g. bone and nervous system). The chemotactic response of monocytes obtained from patients chronically treated with either salmon CT or carbo-CT is impaired, thus suggesting a phenomenon of down-regulation of a common receptor on monocytes. While somatostatin-(1-14) is completely inactive on monocyte chemotaxis, the synthetic analog SMS 201995 is extremely potent. Also, in this case the prolonged treatment of patients with SMS 201995 leads to an impaired chemotactic response.\r"

Basic FGF lacks a classical signal sequence, and it is not clear how it is released from cells. bFGF or bFGF-like activity has not been previously demonstrated in plasma. In an earlier study we showed increased mitogenic activity for parathyroid-derived epithelial and mesenchymal cells in plasma of subjects with familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (FMEN1). In the present study we examined the growth-promoting activity of normal and FMEN1 plasmas [applied to heparin-Sepharose (HS) columns] in parathyroid-derived cloned endothelial cells. FMEN1 plasma HS-adsorbed activity exceeded normal plasma HS-adsorbed activity in 6 of 8 FMEN1 plasma samples. Peak (FMEN1 plasma) HS-adsorbed activity eluted with 0.1-0.3 M NaCl, was completely neutralized by specific antibodies against bFGF, and had an apparent mol wt of 110 kD. Active fractions from FMEN1 plasma prepared by gel filtration in 7 M urea displayed apparent mol wt of about 14-16 kD and showed increased apparent affinity for HS; recovered activity appeared principally in the 3.0-M NaCl eluate. Using a sensitive two-site immunoradiometric assay for bFGF we found 0.4 ng/mL bFGF-like immunoreactivity in the highly purified 3.0-M NaCl eluate from a HS column to which the active components from gel filtration of FMEN1 plasma in 7 M urea were applied. These results imply that bFGF or closely related factors circulate in FMEN1.\r"

  ".W": "Although various abnormalities of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal function have been reported in primary hypothyroidism, neither 24-h patterns of pulsatile cortisol release nor estimation of its endogenous secretion and clearance rates have been fully investigated in this clinical setting. We studied pulsatile and circadian patterns of cortisol secretion in six hypothyroid men [mean free T4 index, 0.59 +/- 0.22 (+/- SE); mean TSH, greater than 50 mU/L] by sampling blood at 20-min intervals for 24 h before (unreplaced) and then after 5-7 months of partial replacement treatment with levo-T4. Compared to a normal group, hypothyroid men had significantly elevated 24-h mean serum concentrations of cortisol (419 vs. 254 nmol/L; P less than 0.001), with no change in serum cortisol-binding globulin concentrations. Cluster analysis of cortisol time series revealed a normal pulse frequency, with significant increases in mean peak amplitude (527 vs. 331 nmol/L; P = 0.001), mean interpulse valley concentrations (384 vs. 204 nmol/L; P less than 0.05), and mean prepeak nadir concentrations (298 vs. 166 nmol/L; P less than 0.05). Cosinor analysis showed preserved circadian rhythmicity (i.e. normal mean circadian amplitude of cortisol release) in hypothyroidism, with a significant delay in the timing of circadian acrophases and an increase in the mesor (mean). Analysis of data by a multiple parameter deconvolution method demonstrated a normal 24-h endogenous cortisol production rate in the presence of significantly prolonged subject-specific half-life of cortisol disappearance (155 vs. 73 min; P less than 0.05). Partial replacement therapy with levo-T4 caused significant decreases in 1) mean 24-h serum cortisol concentrations (419 vs. 323 nmol/L; P less than 0.05); 2) mean cortisol peak amplitudes (527 vs. 375 nmol/L; P less than 0.05); 3) mean prepeak nadir concentrations (298 vs. 221 nmol/L; P less than 0.05); and 4) mean half-life of cortisol disappearance (155 vs. 112 min; P less than 0.0019). In summary, the present study of cortisol secretory dynamics in hypothyroid men has shown elevated mean 24-h serum concentrations of cortisol with preserved circadian rhymicity and normal endogenous production rates, but prolonged half-lives of cortisol disappearance. In conjunction with normal serum cortisol-binding globulin concentrations, these largely reversible findings suggest that significant hypercortisolemia in primary hypothyroidism is primarily due to decreased metabolic clearance of cortisol and a presumptive decrease in the negative feedback effect of cortisol on the hypothalamo-pituitary axis.\r"

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is specific for MIS, with a sensitivity in human serum to 0.5 ng/ml and does not recognize transforming growth factor-beta 1 or -beta 2, LH, or FSH. It similarly fails to recognize other proteins secreted from the cell type into which the MIS gene was cloned. MIS was detected in the serum of normal newborns, infants, children, and adults. In males the serum level of MIS is 10-70 ng/mL at birth. The level increases slightly after birth, and then decreases to a basal level of 2-5 ng/mL after the first 10 yr of life. Newborn male urine contains minimal amounts of MIS (0.5 ng/mL). In females MIS is barely detectable in serum at birth, but rises to the basal level equal to that seen in males after 10 yr of age. Similar basal levels of MIS were found in adult ovarian follicular fluid. MIS levels were high in the serum of a female patient with a sex cord tumor (3200 ng/mL), but fell to 100 ng/mL after multiple excisional operations. In addition, a serum MIS level of 20 ng/mL was detected in a patient with an ovarian granulosa cell tumor. A sensitive assay for MIS could be useful in the diagnosis of patients with congenital abnormalities of sexual development and patients with Sertoli cell and/or other MIS-producing neoplasms. Other applications may also be recognized as the biology of MIS in both males and females is further elucidated.\r"

We purified a 25-kDa IGF-binding protein (BP-25) from amniotic fluid. We tested the effect of this BP-25 preparation on both basal and IGF-I-stimulated growth of chick embryo pelvic cartilages maintained in serum-free organ culture. Cartilage wet weight was 4.1 +/- 0.3 mg/cartilage initially; after 3 days, BP-25 inhibited both basal and IGF-I-stimulated growth. Control cartilages weighed 7.4 +/- 0.7 mg/cartilage, while those incubated with 100 nM BP-25 weighed 5.8 +/- 0.5 mg/cartilage (P less than 0.001 vs. control); BP-25 concentrations as low as 0.2 nM significantly inhibited basal cartilage growth. Cartilages incubated with 1.25 nM IGF-I weighed 10.4 +/- 0.8 mg/cartilage (P less than 0.001 vs. control), while those incubated with both 100 nM BP-25 and 1.25 nM IGF-I weighed 8.1 +/- 0.5 mg/cartilage (P less than 0.001 vs. cartilage incubated with IGF-I alone); BP-25 concentrations as low as 0.4 nM significantly inhibited IGF-I-stimulated cartilage growth. BP-25 also inhibited basal and IGF-I-stimulated increases in cartilage dry weight, [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, and 35SO4 incorporation into proteoglycan. A second BP-25 preparation, which in the presence of 1% platelet-poor plasma acts synergistically with IGF-I to stimulate DNA synthesis and cell replication of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in tissue culture, inhibited IGF-I-stimulated cartilage growth to the same degree as did our BP-25 preparation. In separate experiments, proteins present in serum-free medium conditioned for 3 days by chick cartilages were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with [125I]IGF-I. This medium was found to contain two IGF-binding proteins; one appeared to be the chick equivalent of BP-25, while the other had a molecular mass similar to that of a poorly characterized human 34-kDa IGF-binding protein. We conclude that purified BP-25 inhibits the growth of chick embryo pelvic cartilage in our serum-free organ culture system. Since conditioned medium from these cartilages contains both IGF-I-like peptides and IGF-binding proteins such as BP-25, we suggest that the IGF-binding proteins present may act to down-regulate the growth-promoting effects of the local IGF peptides.\r"

  ".W": "Progesterone withdrawal as a mechanism for parturition in primates is controversial. The progesterone antagonist RU486, given in late pregnancy to rhesus monkeys at a dose of 47 mmol/kg.day (20 mg/kg.day), causes an increase in uterine activity, but not the expected increase in amniotic fluid prostaglandins or cervical dilatation. We, therefore, studied the effect of RU486 on estrogen receptor (ER) localization and concentration in reproductive tract tissues in rhesus monkeys during late gestation and after spontaneous labor at term. Distribution of ER in pregnant uterine tissues was studied by immunocytochemical techniques and quantified by a biochemical assay, both of which employed a monoclonal antibody specific for ER. ER was not present in amnion and chorion by immunocytochemical investigation; however, a significant increase in receptor staining was seen in decidua and myometrium after RU486 treatment compared to that in both pregnant control tissues and parturient tissues. Sucrose gradient assay of nuclear (n) and cytosolic (c) ER revealed a low level of ER (expressed as fmol of estradiol bound/mg of DNA) in pregnant and parturient decidua (pregnant: nER = 7.3 +/- 2.4, cER = 17.1 +/- 6.4; parturient, nER = 7.7 +/- 3.1, cER = 16.4 +/- 8.8) and myometrium (pregnant: nER = 21.7 +/- 4.1, cER = 20.8 +/- 5.3; parturient: nER = 30.0 +/- 2.8, cER = 10.7 +/- 6.7). In contrast, tissues collected from RU486-treated animals contained high levels of ER in decidua (nER = 52.3 +/- 16.8, cER = 240.5 +/- 145.3) and myometrium (nER = 77.0 +/- 19.2; cER = 66.5 +/- 31.6). We conclude that 1) the increase in ER in decidua and myometrium after RU486 treatment is the result of a decrease in the inhibitory action of progesterone on ER and documents the progesterone receptor antagonism by RU486 during induced myometrial contractility in late pregnant rhesus monkeys; 2) the absence of ER from amnion and chorion indicates that the normally observed increase in prostaglandin production by rhesus fetal membranes during labor is not mediated by ER; and 3) the absence of a change in the concentration of ER in decidua and myometrium from pregnant control monkeys and those in spontaneous labor indicates that an increase in ER (and, by inference, a withdrawal of receptor-mediated progesterone inhibition) is not part of the normal events in preparation for parturition in primates.\r"

  ".W": "We measured cortisol and precursor steroid production in response to ACTH, cholera toxin, and forskolin by the dispersed adrenocortical cells prepared from the adrenal glands of 10 patients with different forms of Cushing's syndrome. The cells prepared from the hyperplastic adrenal glands from 4 patients with Cushing's disease responded in a dose-dependent manner to ACTH, cholera toxin, and forskolin. The adrenal cells prepared from 4 encapsulated adrenal adenomas showed no (n = 2), a lowered (n = 1), or a clear (n = 1) response of cortisol release to ACTH. The cells prepared from the adrenal glands of 1 patient with dysplastic micronodular adrenal glands showed a limited response to ACTH, while the cells from an adrenocortical carcinoma, which secreted very little cortisol per cell, were unresponsive to ACTH, cholera toxin, and forskolin. The reaction of the dispersed adrenal cells from these 10 patients to ACTH, cholera toxin, and forskolin showed a close correlation (P less than 0.001 in all instances). This suggests that the defect in autonomous glands is not located at the level of the ACTH receptor, but, rather, involves the adenylate cyclase complex as a whole or its coupling to cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The release into the medium of the cortisol precursors deoxycortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and progesterone showed that the four autonomous nodules were characterized by a significantly higher deoxycortisol/cortisol ratio in the medium (P less than 0.01), suggesting a relative blockade of 11 beta-hydroxylase in these adrenal adenomas. This was further substantiated in cells from several adrenals by a significant increase in the release of these precursors in response to ACTH in the absence of a cortisol response. We conclude the following. 1) Adrenal adenoma formation in patients with Cushing's syndrome is accompanied by a parallel decrease in the stimulation of the release of steroid hormones in response to ACTH, cholera toxin, and forskolin. This points to a defect in the adenoma cells beyond the ACTH receptor. 2) Adrenal adenoma formation in patients with Cushing's syndrome is accompanied by a relative blockade of 11 beta-hydroxylase activity. 3) By comparing the preoperative dynamic tests of the pituitary-adrenal axis, the plasma ACTH concentration, the morphology of the adrenal glands, and their in vitro responsiveness, a gradual transition from pituitary to (partial) adrenal autonomy could be recognized in several patients.\r"

  ".W": "Since serum GH in normal subjects displays a circadian variation with a major and consistent surge after the onset of sleep we examined whether the time of GH administration in GH-deficient patients had any impact on its action. Eight GH-deficient patients all underwent 3 4-week study schedules in random order: 1) evening (2000 h) sc GH injections, 2) morning (0800 h) sc GH injections, and 3) no GH administration. At the end of each period the patients were admitted to hospital for 24-h measurements of hormones and metabolites. For comparison, 10 age- and sex-matched healthy untreated subjects were hospitalized once under identical conditions. Mean (+/- SE) GH availability, i.e. the area under the curve (AUC; micrograms per L/12 h) for 12 h after injection was significantly greater after evening injection than after morning injections [83.3 +/- 25.4 (evening) vs. 46.0 +/- 10.6 (morning); P less than 0.01]. This might be due to higher skin and sc temperatures when in bed. The 2000-0800 h AUC after evening injection was similar to the corresponding AUC in the reference group. Mean 24-h serum insulin-like growth factor-I levels (micrograms per L) were similar after evening (189.8 +/- 2) and morning (179.5 +/- 5.3) injections (P = 0.8), but the latter displayed a circadian variation suggesting that a steady state had not been reached. Both were significantly lower than the stable reference value (248.4 +/- 3.6 micrograms/L). Blood glucose profiles after morning and evening GH did not differ from that of the reference group, whereas blood glucose decreased when the patients received no GH (P less than 0.01). Daytime (0800-2400 h) insulin levels were increased after morning injections (P less than 0.05). Nighttime levels of lipid intermediates were below normal in the untreated state and after morning injection (P less than 0.05), whereas nighttime blood alanine tended to be above normal after morning GH injection (P = 0.08). Highly significant inverse relationships between circadian lipid intermediates and both blood alanine and lactate concentrations were observed in the reference group and in the patients after evening injections. These relationships disappeared after morning injections. We conclude that the metabolic effects of sc GH injections are clearly influenced by the time of administration and that the closest similarity to normal hormone and metabolite patterns and relationships is reached by GH injection in the evening in GH-deficient patients.\r"

The assay has 1% cross-reactivity with human PRL, 0.11% cross-reactivity with human chorionic somatomammotropin, and negligible cross-reactivity with bovine and rat GH. The assay has distinct advantages over the IM-9 lymphocyte RRA in having reduced nonspecific interference from serum proteins and providing a uniform source of receptors which can be stored for long periods at -70 C. The coefficient of variation of the assay is 13%. In studies of 55 sera from short children with normal or elevated serum GH concentrations the mean ratio of RRA GH to immunoradiometric assayed GH was 1.28. This assay provided important information about the total GH activity in pregnancy. There was a progressive rise in RRA GH during pregnancy, reaching 64.7 +/- 2.5 (+/- SE) micrograms/L at term. This level is 2-3 times higher than suggested by earlier estimates made with monoclonal antibody RIAs for pituitary GH. At term the contributions to total GH activity of serum are less than 3% from the pituitary, 12% from human chorionic somatomammotropin reacting with the GH receptor, and 85% from placental GH. Despite this great increase in receptor-reactive GH, somatomedin activity by bioassay is reduced, and IGF-I, determined by RIA after acid-gel filtration, is minimally elevated.\r"

AMH levels were high [81.67 ng/ml +/- 7.44(SEM)] in normal males under 2 yr of age, fell progressively in older boys and, decreased sharply at puberty. Serum AMH was not detectable in adults or in females at any age, with very rare exceptions. AMH serum concentrations were significantly decreased in infants with disorders of sex differentiation, particularly testicular dysgenesis, and increased in patients with delayed puberty. In contrast, levels were not significantly affected by either cryptorchidism or chorionic gonadotropin stimulation. AMH shows promise as a marker of testicular function in infancy.\r"

To study the duration of RU 486 antiglucocorticoid activity on corticotropic function and to establish the means of overcoming it with dexamethasone, plasma corticolipotropic hormones and cortisol were measured in 10 healthy male patients during the 3 days after intake, at 2200 h, of a single 400-mg dose of RU 486, alone or combined with a single dexamethasone dose (1, 2, or 4 mg) given at 2400 h. On the first day after RU 486 alone, ACTH, lipotropin, and cortisol plasma levels were significantly higher than basal values. The 1-mg dose of dexamethasone totally abolished the stimulatory effect of RU 486, and higher doses of dexamethasone (2 and 4 mg) further depressed hormone levels. During the succeeding days, antiglucocorticoid activity of RU 486 alone was still present 34 h after administration, while on the third day all hormone levels returned to normal. After the combined administration, the RU 486 effect reappeared as early as the first day with the 1-mg dose of dexamethasone, while it was delayed until the third day with the higher doses. These results showed that a single 400-mg dose of RU 486 induced a response that lasted at least 34 h. Thus, a dose-dependent competition between RU 486 and dexamethasone was demonstrated. However, the suppressive effect of dexamethasone was only transient, after which the antiglucocorticoid activity of RU 486 reappeared.\r"

Micromolar concentrations of melatonin inhibited in a dose-dependent way ADP-induced platelet aggregation with individual inhibitions 40% or more at 10(-6)-10(-5) M. A significant depression of AA-induced platelet aggregation was observed only at 10(-5)-10(-4) M melatonin. Morning (0830 h)-evening (1800 h) studies of ADP-induced platelet aggregation in seven normal men showed a higher sensitivity at 1800 h when analyzed as a global inhibitory effect of melatonin (P less than 0.01). Moreover, only during the evening hours did melatonin induce reversible aggregation, an index of inhibition of the platelet secretory process elicited by ADP exposure. No diurnal variability in melatonin inhibition of AA-induced aggregation was detected. TxB2 production elicited by AA in the evening was inhibited significantly in a concentration-related manner by a 2-min preincubation with 10(-9)-10(-5) M melatonin, while during the morning hours the inhibition was significant only at 10(-6) M or higher melatonin concentrations. In the case of ADP, the inhibition of TxB2 release attained significance at 10(-5)-M (0830 h) or 10(-6)-M concentrations (1800 h). In the presence of either stimulatory agent, melatonin depression of TxB2 generation was about 2-fold greater at 1800 h than at 0830 h. The diurnal changes in melatonin effect on TxB2 production were also observed in thrombin-stimulated washed platelets. The present data indicate the existence of circadian variations in platelet responsiveness to melatonin in humans.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the temporal features of physiological fluctuation in serum PTH concentration, we sampled peripheral blood at 4-min intervals for 24 h from five normal men (32.8 yr; range, 26-40 yr) and measured serum PTH levels using a two-site immunoradiometric assay with the exquisite sensitivity and specificity for human PTH-(1-84) (intact PTH). The resultant 24-h time series of serum intact PTH levels were assessed by contemporary techniques in chronophysiology for rhythmic and episodic peak detection. Cosinor analysis disclosed a significant circadian rhythm in serum intact PTH concentrations in all five men, with the mean circadian amplitude and acrophase of 7.2 +/- 4.4 ng/L and 2305 +/- 401 h, respectively (mean +/- SD; n = 5). No apparent fixed ultradian periodicity was found by autocorrelation and spectral analyses. Evaluation of episodic intact PTH pulsatility by Cluster analysis revealed 23.0 +/- 4.4 discrete PTH pulses/24 h (P less than 0.01 vs. signal-free noise), which occurred at an interpulse interval of 61.6 +/- 11.1 min. The average duration of a serum intact PTH peak was 42.8 +/- 7.3 min, and its mean incremental amplitude was 12.6 +/- 1.3 ng/L, which corresponded to a 31.8 +/- 5.2% increase above the preceding nadir. Discrete PTH peaks were separated by nonpulsatile valleys which lasted for 17.9 +/- 4.4 min. Cross-correlation between the time series of serum intact PTH and whole blood ionized calcium (Ca2+) was at its maximum (-0.5) at concurrent time points in three subjects, while significant positive correlation between serum intact PTH and simultaneous serum inorganic phosphorus concentrations was observed in four of five subjects. There was no apparent correlation between the levels of serum intact PTH and serum magnesium. Our data show that serum levels of intact PTH, the only biologically active form of PTH in the blood, is characterized by a significant circadian periodicity, spontaneous episodic pulsatility with distinct peak properties, and a significant temporal coupling with Ca2+ and inorganic phosphorus concentrations. We conclude that PTH secretion, as judged by the temporal pattern of serum intact PTH levels, is pulsatile in normal men.\r"

In a randomized study we have investigated the effect of dietary modification in the form of dairy products on vertebral bone mass in 30- to 42-yr-old premenopausal women over a 3-yr period. Twenty women increased their dietary calcium intake by an average of 610 mg/day (P less than 0.03) for 3 yr, while 17 age- and weight-matched women served as controls. Calcium intake was monitored by 3-day diet histories and 24-h urinary calcium excretion. The consumption of the dairy products did not alter serum calcium or PTH levels or the fasting urinary calcium to creatinine ratio. Twenty-four-hour urinary calcium excretion increased by 28% (P less than 0.03) in the supplemented women. Dairy product intake was accompanied by increased dietary fat intake, but there were no statistically significant changes in serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The vertebral bone density in the women consuming increased calcium did not change over the 3-yr period (-0.4 +/- 0.9%). In contrast, the vertebral bone density in the control women declined (-2.9 +/- 0.8%; P less than 0.001) and was significantly lower than that in the supplemented group at 30 and 36 months. The study suggests that dietary modification in the form of dairy products retards vertebral bone loss in premenopausal women. Therefore, increased calcium intake in estrogen-replete premenopausal women may prevent age-related bone loss.\r"

We, therefore, measured plasma NE levels and clearance in 11 hypothyroid patients before [T4 index, 41.2 +/- 7.7 nmol/L (mean +/- SEM); TSH, 71.4 +/- 23.0 mU/L] and 4 +/- 0.5 months after thyroid replacement (T4 index, 136.4 +/- 24.4 nmol/L; TSH, 3.2 +/- 1.2 mU/L) and in 8 healthy volunteers. Plasma dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and chromogranin-A, which are coreleased with NE by sympathetic nerve endings, were also measured. Plasma NE was higher in the hypothyroid (2.37 +/- 0.24 nmol/L) than in the euthyroid state (1.86 +/- 0.24 nmol/L; P less than 0.02) or in the controls (1.87 +/- 0.27 nmol/L). Plasma clearance of NE, however, was not affected after thyroid replacement (hypothyroid, 2.08 +/- 0.31 L/min; euthyroid, 1.94 +/- 0.21 L/min; controls, 1.86 +/- 0.15 L/min). There was no significant change in plasma dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (hypothyroid, 720 +/- 139 nmol/mL.h; euthyroid, 553 +/- 97 nmol/mL.h) or plasma chromogranin-A (hypothyroid, 48.9 +/- 7.1 ng/mL; euthyroid, 42.9 +/- 5.3 ng/mL) after thyroid replacement.

  ".U": "90094659\r", 
  ".W": "There is only one previous report of an estrogen-secreting adrenal tumor occurring in a woman during reproductive years. Our patient presented with mild hirsutism associated with menstrual bleeding every 3-6 weeks. The occurrence of apparently intermenstrual bleeding prompted an evaluation of estrogen levels. Markedly elevated plasma estrone levels were found (860-2305 pmol/L; normal, 50-340). Lesser relative elevations in 11-deoxycortisol and androstenedione were noted. Computed tomographic scanning of the adrenal glands identified a large tumor, which was subsequently resected. Estrone levels fell to 120 pmol/L, and all other abnormalities were corrected. Eighteen months after adrenalectomy, ovulation occurred regularly, and steroid levels were entirely normal. Steroid production in a cell suspension made from tissue obtained from the 190-g tumor was compared with that occurring in normal human adrenal cells. The production of estrone by the tumor cells was 40-fold greater than that by normal adrenal cells. There was also a mild excess of 11-deoxycortisol produced by tumor cells, but the tumor cells were less than 50% as efficient as normal cells in producing cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Examination of the steroid profile in plasma occurring in three other patients with adrenal tumors reveals that while elevations in estrone occur frequently, this is usually due to the peripheral conversion of very high levels of androstenedione. Estrone, androstenedione, and 11-deoxycortisol plasma levels were elevated in all four patients; dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was elevated in only two of four patients. After resection of one of these tumors, all steroid levels remained normal despite the occurrence of extensive metastases. These observations confirm the difficulty of making a diagnosis of estrogen excess in a woman during reproductive years because of the paucity of physical signs. The acquisition of aromatase activity was clearly demonstrated by tumor cells from our patient in vitro. Elevated plasma concentrations of estrone, androstenedione, and 11-deoxycortisol provide useful markers for adrenal tumors, but no one steroid can be relied upon in all tumors, and metastases may lack the steroidogenic capabilities of the primary tumor.\r"

Surgical trauma was associated in all patients with significant decreases in serum total and free T3 and a significant increase in serum rT3 levels, with no variations in serum total and free T4 concentrations. A marked increase in serum cortisol levels was observed, with higher values at night than in the morning. Serum cortisol levels and circadian rhythm normalized on the fifth day. Serum TSH values in the morning significantly decreased on the first day after surgery and returned to normal on the second day. Serum TSH values at night (2400-0200 h) were higher than in the morning preoperatively, but the nocturnal surge was abolished from days 1-5 after surgery and was restored only on the sixth day. Thus, surgery was associated with a prolonged loss of the nocturnal serum TSH surge. This effect on TSH secretion was more marked than predictable on the basis of serum TSH measurements in the morning alone. An inverse relationship was found between serum cortisol and serum TSH values at night, suggesting that the excessive endogenous cortisol secretion might play a role in the derangement of TSH secretion.\r"

Densitometry of Southern blots after cleavage with the restriction enzymes TaqI, PvuII, and BglII was used to measure the ratio of the copy-number of the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21) to the copy-number of its pseudogene (CYP21P). DNA from 16 unrelated patients showed equal hybridization intensities of the 2 genes, indicating that point mutations caused the enzyme deficiency. One of the 2 haplotypes in 7 patients showed evidence of a large gene conversion between the CYP21 and the CYP21P gene without loss of the total number of 21-hydroxylase genes. Deletion of at least 1 21-hydroxylase gene was found in 11 patients. DNA from 8 of these patients had relative hybridization intensities compatible with a deletion of the active 21-hydroxylase gene, CYP21. Two patients with the salt-wasting form of the disease showed homozygous loss of DNA fragments that are specific for the 5' end of the active 21-hydroxylase gene. Nine patients showed relative 21-hydroxylase hybridization intensities compatible with duplication of the gene in 1 or both haplotypes. In conclusion, point mutations, gene conversions, or CYP21 gene deletions are the typical mutations in patients with the simple virilizing and salt-wasting forms of the disease, while duplications of the locus are overrepresented in patients with nonclassical 21-hydroxylase deficiency.\r"

Whether this is a sign of subclinical hyperthyroidism, thus having the potential of adverse effects on different organs with time, is not known. We have measured serum levels of 2 markers of thyrometabolic status at the tissue level, bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (BGP), reflecting the function of osteoblasts, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), reflecting the function of hepatocytes, in 44 patients (41 women and 3 men) with nontoxic goiter (11 diffuse and 33 nodular goiters; serum T4, T3, free T4, and free T3 levels had been normal and stable for at least 0.5 yr). Serum TSH levels ranged from normal to unmeasurably low values (less than 0.05 mU/L). Serum TSH levels correlated negatively to serum BGP levels (r = -0.60; P less than 0.001). Due to the postmenopausal surge in serum BGP levels, premenopausal women (n = 21) were tested separately without changing the significance (r = -0.53; P less than 0.02). Expressing serum BGP values as a percentage of the mean value in control subjects of the same age and sex did not change the correlation (r = -0.63; P less than 0.001). Six patients had serum BGP levels above the normal range, and patients with reduced serum TSH levels (less than 0.45 mU/L; n = 12) had significantly enhanced serum BGP levels [median, 1.53 nmol/L (range, 1.02-4.24) vs. 1.23 nmol/L (0.62-3.71); P less than 0.05]. Serum TSH also correlated negatively to serum SHBG levels (r = -0.56; P less than 0.001; women alone: r = -0.58; P less than 0.001). Eight patients had serum SHBG levels above the normal range, and patients with reduced serum TSH levels had significantly enhanced serum SHBG levels, expressed as a percentage of the mean control value for the relevant sex [203% (range, 75-288) vs. 120% (42-317); P less than 0.01]. It is concluded that the lower serum TSH levels in patients with nontoxic goiter, the higher are serum BGP and SHBG levels. This suggests a progressively generalized (not only pituitary) tissue overexposure to thyroid hormones, the lower the serum TSH levels. Therefore, the finding of a reduced serum TSH level in patients with nontoxic goiter might reflect supraphysiological levels of T4 and/or T3, which could possibly be harmful.\r"

The adrenal steroid response to an iv bolus of ACTH-(1-24) in the patients (aged 9 months to 9 7/12 yr) was compared to that in 16 normal controls (prepubertal, n = 9; Tanner stage II pubic hair, n = 7). The patient population consisted of 20 Hispanics (17 from the Dominican Republic), 13 black Americans, and 1 black Haitian. All patients had normal stimulated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), 11-deoxycortisol (compound S), and desoxycorticosterone, thereby ruling out 21-hydroxylase deficiency and 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency, respectively. To evaluate for the presence of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) deficiency, the patients were classified on the basis of their 60-min delta 5-17-hydroxypregnenolone/17-OHP (delta 5-17P/17-OHP) ratio [PP1 (n = 13), less than or equal to 2 SD of Tanner I controls; PP2 (n = 17), greater than 2 SD above Tanner I controls and less than or equal to 2 SD Tanner II controls; and PP3 (n = 4), greater than 2 SD above Tanner II controls; 2.1 +/- 1.0, 6.1 +/- 1.7, and 16.1 +/- 3.3 for PP1, PP2, and PP3, respectively. delta 5-17P/17-OHP for PP1 vs. PP2, PP2 vs. PP3, and PP1 vs. PP3 were significantly different (P less than 0.05) by analysis of variance and multiple comparison testing using the Student-Newman-Keuls procedure. The four patients in PP3 were considered to have a possible nonclassical 3 beta-HSD deficiency. This diagnosis was supported by the fact that these patients had the greatest increment in delta 5-17P and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels as well as the highest stimulated delta 5-17P/cortisol (delta 5-17P/F) ratio among the patient groups. In contrast to the ACTH-stimulated androgens there were no differences in the baseline delta 5-17P/170HP or androgens among the patient groups. Additionally, the 60-min delta 5-17P/17-OHP within the patient groups was highly correlated with the 60 min-values for delta 5-17P, DHEA, DHEA/delta 4-androstendione, and delta 5-17P/F. In the children with PP the mean bone age/chronological age (BA/CA) was 1.27 +/- .27, the mean BA/height age (BA/HA) was 1.09 +/- 0.25, and the mean HA/CA was 1.18 +/- 0.17. No differences were noted between the patient population groups in mean BA/CA, mean BA/HA, or mean HA/CA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have estimated the relative contributions of age and menopause to forearm mineral density in 485 normal postmenopausal women up to age 75 yr. In 87 pairs matched for years since menopause, in which 1 member was below 61 yr and the other was 61 yr or older, the mean bone density was significantly lower in the older than in the younger subjects despite their identical years since menopause (P less than 0.001). Further analysis suggested a model for bone loss after the menopause which comprises a menopausal component of exponential type and an age-related component which is linear and starts in the mid-50s. According to this model, a 70-yr-old woman has lost 11% of her bone due to menopause and 18% as a function of age. Thereafter, the age-related function is dominant. Early menopause is associated with a self-limiting loss of bone which does not progress further until aging exerts its effect. The main conclusion is that the significance of early menopause as a risk factor for osteoporosis has been overstated.\r"

  ".U": "90094673\r", 
  ".W": "Twenty-two apparently euthyroid patients with endocrine ophthalmopathy not associated with goiter, antithyroid microsomal or antithyroglobulin antibodies, or overt thyroid disease (so-called ophthalmic Graves' disease) were tested for subclinical hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. We measured 131I uptake and scan, serum T3 (by RIA), and serum TSH using a sensitive (by immunoradiometric assay) assay. Three patients were found to be hyperthyroid, and 1 was hypothyroid. The remaining 18 patients, who remained euthyroid throughout the study period, were investigated for evidence for antibody-mediated immunity against thyroid antigens. We measured antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against fresh thyroid cells using a 51chromium release assay, thyroid membrane-reactive antibodies in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay incorporating solubilized thyroid membranes, and TSH receptor-binding antibodies using a RRA and carried out sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting with patient sera for antibodies reactive with 64 and 110 kDa (thyroid peroxidase) membrane proteins. Bands were demonstrated, on SDS-PAGE, at 64 or 110 kDa in 13 patients, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity tests were positive in 7 patients, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was positive in 4 of the 17 patients tested. In addition, TSH receptor antibody tests were positive in 5 patients, none of whom had other evidence for hyperthyroidism. Finally, significant lymphocyte infiltration was demonstrated on aspiration biopsy in 3 patients. All 18 patients had positive tests in at least 1 of the immunological assays. We believe that these data support the hypothesis that endocrine ophthalmopathy always occurs in patients with overt or subclinical Graves' hyperthyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, or thyroid immunological abnormalities. Those patients previously described as having euthyroid Graves' disease should, thus, be considered to have associated thyroid immunological abnormalities even though histological confirmation (from aspiration needle biopsy) may be obtained in only a minority of the patients. The possibility that the mechanism for this close association is cross-reactivity of cytotoxic antibodies against a thyroid/eye muscle cell surface shared antigen is discussed in the context of recent evidence from the authors' laboratory.\r"

To further define the subcellular location of the autoantibody binding, each fraction was assayed for organelle-specific marker enzyme activities. Enzyme activities were correlated to adrenal autoantibody binding to each fraction by linear regression. Of the materials tested, both antibody binding and inhibition of binding were most highly correlated with adrenal subcellular fractions enriched with cytochrome-c reductase and 5'-nucleotidase (r = 0.98; P less than 0.05). Thus, our data support the localization of adrenal autoantigen(s) in the microsomes, plasma membrane, or both.\r"

For evaluation of the concordance of test reactions between the TRUE Test and the Finn Chamber test, the same 12 allergens mixed in petrolatum were also applied to the upper back according to the Finn Chamber technique. The reproducibility of TRUE Test results was compared with the reproducibility of the Finn Chamber test in 76 other patients. The concordance of positive reactions between the two tests was 57%, somewhat lower than in recently published studies. The percentage of nonreproducible positive results was more than twice as high with Finn Chambers, (22 of 58 positive reactions, or 37.9%) as with the TRUE Test (5 of 28 reactions, or 17.9%). However, this difference in reproducibility in the two test systems was not significant as determined by the chi 2 test (p less than 0.05).\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have documented that atopic dermatitis can worsen when patients ingest specific foods to which they are sensitive. In this article we demonstrate that patient contact with specific aeroallergens can cause flares of atopic dermatitis. Marked improvement in skin symptoms was noted when 12 patients (eight males and four females; ages, 1 to 54 years) were removed from their unusual environment. In response to prick tests, these patient had markedly positive, immediate wheel-and-flare reactions to a variety of aeroallergen extracts (tree, grass, and weed pollen; house dust mite; animal protein; and mold spores). The same patients were subsequently patch tested on uninvolved, nonabraded skin with the allergen extracts that had yielded positive prick tests. Patch tests were applied for 48 hours, removed, and interpreted 24 hours later. The patients reacted to specific aeroallergens with an eczematous eruption at 48 and 72 hours. Positive delayed cutaneous reactions correlated strongly with aeroallergens identified in the patient's environment or suspected by the patients as provocateurs of their atopic dermatitis. Delayed cutaneous reactions were negative to allergens not historically relevant. Continued avoidance of aeroallergens that elicited an eczematous reaction at patch test sites resulted in marked improvement or resolution of dermatitis in all patients. We conclude that aeroallergen contact plays an important role in select patients with atopic dermatitis.\r"

To compare methylprednisolone and prednisolone concentrations in the bronchoalveolar space, we administered these two corticosteroids in a randomized, crossover fashion to 17 adult rabbits. A loading dose was administered and was followed by a continuous infusion for 180 minutes to achieve steady-state plasma concentrations between 200 to 2000 ng/ml. Serial plasma samples were obtained during the infusions. Bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were performed at 180 minutes with sterile saline. Plasma and BAL fluid (BALF) were assayed for methylprednisolone and prednisolone concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography. Corticosteroid concentrations were normalized to urea concentrations in plasma and BALF. Generally, BALF corticosteroid concentration increased as plasma concentration increased. At plasma concentrations greater than 800 ng/ml, BALF methylprednisolone concentrations increased exponentially, whereas the increase for prednisolone remained linear. BALF methylprednisolone was five times as high as that of prednisolone when plasma corticosteroid concentration was in the 2000 ng/ml range. With this continuous infusion technique, methylprednisolone has a higher degree of bronchoalveolar penetration than prednisolone, and these differences are greater at higher plasma concentrations.\r"

The double-blind, randomized, parallel study was conducted and performed in spring and early summer. BHR and FEV1 were measured on two occasions, before the start of treatment and monthly thereafter for 4 months. Symptoms, peak expiratory flow, and concomitant medication were registered daily. Nine of the 12 patients receiving ipratropium bromide and all eight patients receiving fenoterol completed the study. Patients completing treatment had few symptoms and were in a stable condition throughout the treatment period. Neither the administration of ipratropium bromide nor fenoterol resulted in a significant change of BHR.

Evidence is presented that substance P (SP) plays a predominant role in mediating intradermal SEB challenge in unsensitized monkeys. With a rabbit SP antiserum directed against the C-terminal region of SP, a concentration-dependent inhibition of SEB-induced skin reactivity could be demonstrated. Furthermore, a rabbit antiserum directed against the mast cell activating N-terminal part of SP was capable of impeding SEB-induced skin reactions totally. By use of SP antagonists, significant reduction of skin reactions evoked by SEB was found. Finally, capsaicin pretreatment of the skin caused a substantial inhibition of SEB-induced skin reactivity. These data suggest that SEB exerts its effect on cutaneous mast cells via stimulation of primary sensory neurons that contain SP. Moreover, a new in vivo model is described for studies of nerve-mast cell interactions.\r"

Neutrophils from patients with SGD are deficient in lactoferrin (Lf), an antimicrobial protein commonly found in many mucosal secretions. Unstimulated and stimulated nasal secretions, saliva, and tears were collected from a patient with SGD and from normal control subjects and were analyzed for Lf. The secretions from the patient contained normal values of Lf, suggesting that the glands secrete Lf from a source other than neutrophils. Immunohistochemical staining of normal nasal mucosa demonstrated that Lf is localized within serous submucosal gland cells and that neutrophils are not normally observed in the nasal mucosa. These findings suggest that glandular tissues produce and locally secrete Lf by processes that are independent of neutrophil degranulation.\r"

The same measurements were performed in seven subjects with asthma with previously documented dual (early plus late) asthmatic responses after inhalation challenges with methacholine and allergen. EOSs (p less than 0.001), MBP (p less than 0.01), EDN (p less than 0.01), and ECP (p greater than 0.03) were elevated in the subjects with asthma compared with control subjects, whereas EPO (p less than 0.01) concentrations were reduced. There were no significant differences between baseline measurements of FEV1, EOSs, MBP, EDN, EPO, or ECP on the methacholine- and allergen-challenge days. When the changes in these variables after allergen challenge were compared with the corresponding changes after methacholine challenge, there were no significant differences at 0 to 60 minutes or at 3 hours, whereas EDN (p less than 0.025), EPO (p less than 0.05), and ECP (p less than 0.025) were relatively increased at 6 to 12 hours and accompanied the late falls in FEV1 (p less than 0.001). EOSs (p less than 0.025) were elevated at 24 hours when there was a small relative increase in MBP (p less than 0.05). EOSs appear to be \"activated\" in subjects with allergic asthma, and further activation may occur during late asthmatic responses.\r"

Two hundred venom-allergic patients (4 to 82 years; mean +/- SD, 37.3 +/- 14.2 years) who were first observed with systemic reactions (SRs) were investigated yearly for up to 3 years. Among these patients, 72 were allergic to honeybee venom, 83 to yellow jacket venom, and 45 to both yellow jacket and Polistes venom. At each visit patients had skin tests and RAST to venom. All patients had the same semirush protocol and a monthly maintenance dose of 200 micrograms. After 1 year of treatment, 19% of bee venom-allergic subjects and 35% of vespid venom-allergic individuals had a negative skin test and RAST to the corresponding venom. The percentage of negativation of tests increased after 3 years to 30.5% in bee venom-allergic patients and to 54% in vespid venom-allergic individuals. This rapid and relatively important negativation of skin tests and RAST may be due to a monthly maintenance dose of 200 micrograms; 76 patients experienced a field sting without any SR, two patients had a severe SR, and three patients had a mild SR. Although we tried to define parameters that might predict the abolition of venom sensitivity before starting immunotherapy, we could not find any parameter except venom species. Children and adults behave similarly in terms of evolution of venom sensitization. Mean serum venom-specific IgG levels were significantly lower in patients who had lost their sensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "A 2- to 5-hour regimen of rapid venom immunotherapy (RVIT) was administered to 33 patients with anaphylactic sensitivity to Hymenoptera venom in a hospital setting in which full emergency resuscitation equipment was available. The RVIT was administered as 10 increasing doses of each treatment venom every 10 to 15 minutes to achieve a final dose on day 1 of 58.55 micrograms per venom. Patients returned for booster venom injections of 60 micrograms on day 3, 70 micrograms on day 7, 80 micrograms on day 21, and 100 micrograms on day 35 after RVIT. Serial antigen-induced leukocyte histamine release studies were performed on day 1 in 10 patients before and after RVIT, as well as 3 1/2 months after initiation of RVIT. Of 33 patients, 32 achieved a cumulative venom dose on day 1 of at least 50 micrograms, and the entire group received a mean dose of 95.46 micrograms. Local reactions during RVIT occurred in 18 (55%) patients. Four patients (12%) experienced mild systemic reactions during or after completion of RVIT. Subsequent booster venom doses administered to 29 patients were well tolerated. A decrease in venom-induced leukocyte-histamine release from baseline was detected in three (30%) patients immediately after RVIT and in seven (70%) patients months after achieving maintenance doses. Cutaneous sensitivity decreased by at least one log10 concentration in eight (32%) of 25 patients. Twenty-two natural re-sting events occurred in 12 (50%) of 24 patients surveyed after successful completion of RVIT, of whom seven identified the insect as one for which they had been treated. No systemic reactions were reported. Results of this study indicate that RVIT is a safe, alternative method of venom administration for patients who are at immediate risk for re-sting anaphylactic episodes.\r"

Airway responsiveness to histamine was enhanced 24 hours after allergen exposure (geometric mean of the 50% reduction in effective dose [ED50] of dynamic compliance [Cdyn] before challenge, 3.46 mg/ml, decreased to 0.52 mg/ml after challenge, p less than 0.01; pulmonary resistance ED50 geometric mean before challenge, 3.50 mg/ml, decreased to 0.65 mg/ml after challenge, p less than 0.05). In a random crossover study, the selective platelet-activating factor antagonist, BN 52021 (60 mg/kg, orally, 1 hour before allergen challenge), significantly reduced the allergen-induced airway obstruction (p less than 0.005). In addition, pretreatment with BN 52021 reduced the associated increased airway responsiveness induced by allergen exposure (prechallenge Cdyn ED50, 1.93; after challenge, 2.13 mg/ml; pulmonary resistance ED50, 1.91 mg/ml before challenge and 1.69 mg/ml after challenge). These present observations suggest a role for platelet-activating factor in the pathogenesis of allergen-induced airway obstruction and in the development of airway hyperresponsiveness in an allergic rabbit model.\r"

Of the 3236 subjects studied, 89% had experienced an historical sting systemic reaction (SSR). Seventy-four percent of all subjects and 76% of subjects who had experienced an historical SSR had a positive skin test to at least one venom. More subjects tested positive to yellow jacket venom (51.8%) than to any other venom. There were no significant differences of the wheal and erythema sizes associated with different venoms or different historical sting reactions. Forty-five percent of subjects with positive venom skin tests (VST) were positive to wasp, and 89% of these subjects were also positive to at least one of the following venoms: yellow jacket, yellow hornet, or white-faced hornet. Sixty-four of the 3236 subjects studied (2%) had a systemic reaction (SR) during VST; 13 of the SRs (0.4%) were severe. Thirteen of 64 adverse reactions (20%) were possibly vasovagal, and six other subjects (9%) demonstrated no symptoms of immediate-type hypersensitivity. Thus, 45 (1.4%) of the 3236 subjects tested had an SR that was considered to be a reaction of hypersensitivity, of which eight reactions (0.25%) were severe. Allergic SRs are associated with VST but are unusual and are rarely severe.\r"

Forty-three patients with documented intraperitoneal injury were included in the study and separated into hypotensive and normotensive groups using a systolic blood pressure of 90 or 100 mm Hg. The difference in mean pulse rates between normotensive and hypotensive groups was not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05) although a wide range of pulse rates was noted in both groups. Nearly half of all hypotensive patients were not tachycardic, defined as a pulse rate less than 100. Similar findings were observed when the 117 sets of vital signs recorded both in the field and in the emergency department were analyzed as independent pieces of data. Several mechanisms are proposed for the lack of tachycardia in the presence of hypotension. This data suggest that tachycardia may not be a reliable sign of hypovolemic shock when defined by blood pressure criteria in these patients.\r"

Although rare, acute compartment syndrome resulting from seemingly minor injury or exertion has been reported. Pain out of proportion to the apparent injury and a history of chronic leg pain with exertion may be helpful in identifying these patients prior to development of more obvious signs and symptoms. The diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome may be confirmed by compartmental pressure measurement. Prompt intervention is indicated once the diagnosis is established.\r"

Focal motor abnormalities may be the chief initial presentation of diabetes mellitus in the nonketotic hyperglycemic state in 6% of patients. Nonketotic hyperglycemia (NKH), in particular, may manifest any of a wide variety of movement disorders. These have been described as focal seizures, epilepsia partialis continua, myoclonus, and opsoclonia. There are descriptions of movement disorders in hyperglycemia that are similar to the coarse flapping tremor of asterixis, the posturing of paroxysmal kinetogenic choreoathetosis, and of \"fencing (stance) seizures.\" Disorders of facial motor function including aphasia, facial muscle twitching and jerking, and disorders of muscular tone have been described. These may include hemiparesis and hemiplegias as well as increased tone, in some cases mimicking the nuchal rigidity of meningitis. The movement disorders in NKH may mimic cerebral vascular accidents, meningitis, or psychiatric disorders, as well as various types of seizures. Clinicians may be able to avoid expensive and time-consuming diagnostic evaluations to rule out NKH in patients with movement disorders. We present two patients with focal motor abnormalities associated with nonketonic hyperglycemia and review the pertinent literature.\r"

An orogastric tube was placed, gastric contents aspirated, and gastric lavage performed with 60 to 180 mL aliquots of tap water or 0.9% NaCl for irrigation. A volume of 12.8 +/- 4.4 liters of lavage fluid was instilled, and 97.6 +/- 6.9% of this volume was recovered. The recovered aspirate and lavage fluid were inspected for the presence of particulate matter and saved in 4 to 5 liter collections. Determination of cyclic antidepressant and metabolite concentrations was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the amount of cyclic antidepressant recovered was calculated. The mean total amount recovered was 110 mg and ranged from 2.4 mg to 342 mg. Of the total amount recovered, 88% +/- 13% was recovered in the first 4 to 5 liters of lavage fluid. An estimate of the dose ingested was available in 7 patients, with 8.7% (0.4% to 21.7%) of the estimated dose recovered by lavage. There were no cases of significant drug recovery in clear lavage fluid. We conclude that if gastric lavage is undertaken in cyclic antidepressant intoxications, it should utilize 5 liters initially and then continue only if particulate matter is seen.\r"

While several methods of predicting patient loads have been suggested, a reliable technique has not been established. This study examines the frequency of medical emergencies at the Syracuse University Carrier Dome, a 50,500-seat indoor stadium. Patient volume and level of care at collegiate basketball and football games as well as rock concerts, over a 7-year period were examined and tabulated. This information was analyzed using simple regression and nonparametric statistical methods to determine level of correlation between crowd size and patient volume. These analyses demonstrated no statistically significant increase in patient volume for increasing crowd size for basketball and football events. There was a small but statistically significant increase in patient volume for increasing crowd size for concerts. A comparison of similar crowd size for each of the three events showed that patient frequency is greatest for concerts and smallest for basketball. The study suggests that crowd size alone has only a minor influence on patient volume at any given event. Structuring medical services based solely on expected crowd size and not considering other influences such as event type and duration may give poor results.\r"

Fatigue patients were demographically similar to nonfatigue patients but had significantly worse physical and mental health at study intake. Sixty-three percent of physicians and 52% of patients rated fatigue origin as primarily physical (gamma = 0.48, P less than .05), but in 41% of cases, physicians indicated there was substantial interaction between physical and psychological factors. Only two factors--depression and anxiety--separated fatigue of physical origin from fatigue of psychological origin. Clinicians must thoughtfully evaluate fatigue's often multiple causes and communicate their understanding of those causes to the patient to gain support for a reasonable treatment regimen.\r"

Two-way analysis of variance revealed the following factors to be significantly associated with higher total HAS scores: greater number of medical diagnoses (P = .007), taking more medications (P = .001), history of psychiatric treatment (P = .007), being declared disabled (P = .002), and living with others (P = .025). Each of these variables might contribute to greater psychological or physical discomfort, increased medical utilization, and difficulty with cardiac rehabilitation. The complexity of psychosocial factors in determining distress is addressed, since subjects living with others scored higher than those who were socially isolated (HAS mean score = 17.9 +/- 8 vs 10.7 +/- 5.5, respectively, P = .025).\r"

  ".W": "A sample of Ohio family physicians was surveyed by mail questionnaire regarding physician attitudes and practices concerning do-not-hospitalize (DNH) orders. One hundred seventy-three of the 210 physicians who completed the survey provided care for patients in nursing homes. Fifty-eight percent of physicians caring for nursing home patients were familiar with the concept of do not hospitalize, and 42% had utilized a DNH order. The most commonly named reasons for using a DNH order were patient's terminal condition and patient's request. The most common reasons physicians did not use a DNH order were because of family objections and the inability of nursing homes to deliver intravenous antibiotics and fluids. Almost all physicians had encountered a clinical situation where a DNH order might be appropriate, and 73% of physicians familiar with the DNH concept had utilized the order. Familiarizing more physicians with the concept of DNH orders may have great potential for reducing health care costs and preserving patient autonomy. Future studies are needed to validate the concept of do not hospitalize.\r"

This paper describes a Christian physician support group and contrast it with the more traditional Balint model support group. Issues of membership, leadership, and use of the group are discussed. The potential use and misuse of religiously oriented support groups are outlined. Thirteen Christian physician members of a study group were given questionnaires regarding participation in and expectations of the group. They were asked to comment on the extent to which their religious convictions influenced their practice of medicine. Participants discussed a wide range of issues both personal and professional. They benefited from the opportunity to share views with others who brought a spiritual perspective to patient care. Members stated that their spiritual beliefs influenced their attitudes toward social issues, such as abortion and divorce, and their practice of medicine, for example, by praying with and for their patients. The group provided a safe place to explore these beliefs.\r"

In 1984 the faculty of the University of Vermont Department of Family Practice needed to upgrade its obstetric curriculum in a community where family practice obstetrics was nonexistent. The key steps to a new curriculum included the recruitment of family practice faculty with experience in obstetrics, expanded communication with the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the development of baseline attending privileges in family practice obstetrics, the formation of educational tracks for residents, and the promotion of chart audits. Also important were faculty role modeling, intradepartmental meetings, intensive elective rotations, and community education. This case report of program development in family practice obstetrics may serve as a model to help other residency programs.\r"

The survey was distributed to a random sample of 30% of the family physicians, general practitioners, general internists, and general pediatricians in the Washington State Medical Association in 1986. Responses from 322 physicians (71%) indicated that most primary care physicians had a negative attitude toward such plans. Participants in capitation-based plans (48% of total respondents) had a nearly neutral attitude, which was significantly different from the attitude of nonparticipants. Respondents identified the main disadvantages of such plans as confusion about benefits, increased administrative demands, liability risks, altered professional relationships, and loss of autonomy. The main advantages perceived were increased physician awareness of cost, increased importance of the primary care role, and reduction of unnecessary health care utilization. Attitudes were significantly more negative among solo practitioners and physicians with more years in practice. Respondents rated selection of consultants, favorable economic arrangements, and benefits information as the features most likely to influence them to participate in capitation-based plans.\r"

Of the 14 verified facial nerve tumors, all but two were neurinomas and 11 had important intracranial extensions into the middle and/or the posterior fossa. In most of these 14 cases, surgical removal was performed via the translabyrinthine route, which is advantageous in that it displays the characteristic relationship of the tumor to the facial nerve, and facilitates nerve repair. The clinical and radiological features of these facial nerve lesions are discussed and also the indications for surgical treatment which, as the unoperated cases illustrate, is not always necessary.\r"

Although parenteral treatment with interleukin-2 (IL-2) alone or a combination of IL-2 and LAK cells reduces tumor load and prolongs survival in mice with pulmonary, peritoneal, or hepatic metastases, the effect of these treatments on brain metastases has not been studied. To determine in an animal model if intracerebral metastases would be protected by the immunologically privileged status of the brain, intracardiac and intravenous injections of 10(5) KHT sarcoma cells were performed in C3H mice to create brain and lung metastases, respectively. The mice were treated with adoptive immunotherapy to determine if efficacy seen in an extracerebral site could be reproduced in the brain, and if histological examination of these brains would reveal a significant degree of lymphocyte infiltration and cytolytic activity. Animals were treated with either parenteral IL-2 (7500 U three times daily on Days 3 to 7 after tumor injection), or IL-2 plus LAK cells (7500 U IL-2 times daily on Days 3 to 7, and 10(8) LAK cells intravenously on Days 3 and 6 after tumor injection), or IL-2 excipient (three times daily on Days 3 to 7 after tumor injection). As compared to control animals, pulmonary metastases on Day 14 after tumor injection were reduced or eliminated in animals treated with either IL-2 or IL-2 plus LAK cells (p less than 0.01). In these same animals, there was no reduction in the number of intracerebral metastases and no evidence of lymphocytic infiltration or cytolytic activity in the brain. This is the first study that reveals an organ-specific resistance to the treatment of metastases with adoptive immunotherapy, and affirms the concern that due to inadequate trafficking of endogenous or exogenous-activated lymphocytes or due to inadequate activation of in situ brain lymphoid precursors, there is no rejection of tumors in the brain. This information suggests that brain metastases in patients with systemic malignancies will not respond to intravenous treatment with LAK cells and IL-2, and that alternative forms of treatment are needed. Furthermore, this modification of a previously existing model of murine brain metastasis provides a method for concurrently evaluating the effectiveness of treatments for intra- and extracranial cancers.\r"

The 18F activity in the tumor tissue 45 minutes after intravenous injection of 18F-FUdR was about 12 times higher than that in the contralateral cortex. Double-labeled autoradiography with 18F-FUdR and 14C-thymidine revealed similar brain-tumor images. In contrast, an autoradiographic comparison of 18F-FUdR with 14C-aminoisobutyric acid, which reveals the impairment of the blood-brain barrier, showed very different images. Also, the 18F radioactivity in the tumor tissue was at a constant level for 30 to 120 minutes, whereas a notable increase in 18F activity with time was observed in nucleotides and acid-insoluble fractions. These results suggest that the distribution pattern of 18F-FUdR closely correlates with the metabolism of nucleic acid and that this drug could be a useful tracer for positron emission tomography.\r"

The present study was designed to determine the immunogenicity of such basal lamina allografts (grafts that are genetically different) and their potential as bridging material for nerve gap repair. Inbred strains of Fischer and Buffalo rats with known histocompatibility differences were used. Acellular grafts were prepared by repeated freezing and thawing nerve tissue predegenerated in situ for 6 weeks. Non-frozen predegenerated nerves were used as cellular grafts for comparison. Fischer rats were used as hosts and received cellular or acellular grafts obtained from Fischer (isograft, genetically identical) or Buffalo (allograft) donors. The grafts were evaluated morphologically at 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks after transplantation. The cellular isografts supported axonal regeneration best. The cellular allografts were invariably rejected and were unsuccessful or only partially successful in supporting regeneration. In contrast, acellular allografts, in spite of their mild immunogenicity were successful in supporting regeneration, as were the acellular isografts. The rate of host axonal regeneration and recovery of target muscle was reduced in acellular allografts and isografts as compared to cellular isografts. It is concluded that acellular allografts are suitable for supporting axonal regeneration and may be used to bridge gaps in injured peripheral nerves.\r"

Intraperitoneal dexamethasone was administered at doses ranging from 12 to 48 mg/sq m for 3 days; gentamicin delivery to the brain was then evaluated after either intravenous or intracarotid administration in both control and BBB-modified animals. Only animals receiving the highest dose of dexamethasone and in which the gentamicin was given intravenously demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in drug delivery. The effect of dexamethasone over a wide range of dosages, therefore, exhibited only modest effects on drug delivery to normal brain after osmotic BBB disruption.\r"

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has renewed interest in the treatment of this disorder because of the precise accuracy in diagnosis and localization of these lesions that it affords. The MR image demonstrates characteristic findings of multiple hemorrhages of varying ages surrounded by a hypointense peripheral zone of hemosiderin. Five cases of vascular brain-stem malformation diagnosed with MR imaging are described. The vascular malformations could be demonstrated as \"flow void\" areas in three cases. Three patients were treated surgically and vascular malformations were confirmed: all three patients improved postoperatively. Two patients were treated nonsurgically; one of these recovered from a second hemorrhage and the other experienced neurological deterioration after a single hemorrhage. High-energy radiotherapy was not effective for the one vascular malformation treated by this method. This experience suggests that surgical exploration should be considered for vascular brain-stem malformations when the diagnosis is confirmed by MR criteria and the clinical course and lesion are both progressive in character.\r"

Four of these patients had intracavernous neoplasms with invasion of the ICA and two had intracavernous ICA aneurysms that could not be clipped or occluded with intraluminal balloons. All but one patient had evidence of poor collateral flow reserve in a balloon occlusion test of the ICA. The superficial temporal artery was not present in four patients, was minuscule in one, and was damaged during the initial dissection in another, making it unsuitable for superficial temporal-to-middle cerebral artery branch anastomosis. Blood flow within the graft could not be established intraoperatively in one patient (who had excellent collateral circulation) due to the small size of the vein (3 mm). In all others, the grafts were patent on follow-up arteriography and transcranial Doppler studies. Three patients who had severe reduction of cerebral blood flow during test occlusion of the ICA exhibited temporary hemispheric neurological deficits postoperatively; the deficits were related to the duration of temporary ICA occlusion. All three recovered completely without evidence of infarction on computerized tomography (CT). One patient who clinically could not tolerate the balloon occlusion test of the ICA also had temporary neurological deficits with good recovery but showed evidence of border-zone infarction on CT scans. The present role of saphenous vein graft bypass of the cavernous ICA is discussed.\r"

Most of the granulomas were composed of fibrochondrocalcifying material. The lesion was particularly dangerous when located in a strategic site, such as the foramen magnum or the base of the skull. Two of the 14 patients with this pseudotumor died, and the other 12 have done well. Complete ablation, marginal or even intralesional, assures control of the lesion. The lesion is probably reactive rather than neoplastic.\r"

Based on Kaplan-Meier survival curves, the overall half-life (T1/2) of this procedure was 16 months. Although none of the patients developed anesthesia dolorosa or corneal ulceration, one group of patients developed either a clinical or subclinical persistent \"minimal hypesthesia.\" In these there was a statistically significant difference in the T1/2 associated with this procedure (p = 0.01). This finding suggests that, contrary to the general belief, persistent hypesthesia after glycerol rhizolysis is a negative indicator of long-term success.\r"

Four patients who no longer had a viable biceps brachialis muscle underwent an anastomosis between transposed intercostal nerves and a free vascularized gracilis muscle grafted to the position of the biceps. Two of these patients obtained good elbow flexion. Although synkinesis between the biceps brachialis and the inspiratory muscles can be demonstrated during coughing and deep inspiration, the patients learn to flex their reinnervated biceps brachialis muscle and maintain flexion independent of respiration.\r"

Quantitative spectral analysis was performed by measuring the area under individual peaks using a computer algorithm. In eight patients with histologically benign tumors the spectra were considered to be qualitatively indistinguishable from normal brain. The phosphocreatine/inorganic phosphate ratio (PCr/Pi) averaged 2.0. Five patients had histologically malignant tumors; qualitatively, four of these were considered to have abnormal spectra, showing a decrease in the PCr peak. The PCr/Pi ratio for this group averaged 0.85, which was significantly lower than that seen in the benign tumor group (p less than 0.05). No difference between the two groups was seen in adenosine triphosphate or phosphomonoesters. It is concluded that a specific metabolic \"fingerprint\" for childhood brain tumors may not exist, but that some malignant tumors show a pattern suggestive of ischemia.\r"

Preoperatively, only 15 patients had claudication; however, 23 experienced relief or exacerbation of symptoms related to changes in posture. A good postoperative result was obtained in 82% of the entire series, but in only 50% of patients whose symptoms were not affected by posture. Of those whose symptoms did have a postural component, a good result was obtained in 96%. The relief of back pain by decompressive surgery was significantly less successful than the relief of leg pain. It is therefore suggested that surgery be restricted to as few levels as possible.\r"

Eight easily evaluated parameters were found to be significant for predicting nonrecovery of consciousness. The following six features were present during the early posttraumatic phase (that is, during the 1st week after trauma): fever of central origin; diffuse body sweating; disturbances in antidiuretic hormone secretion; abnormal motor reactivity; respiratory disturbances; and diffuse nonneurological injuries. The first three features were manifestations of hypothalamic damage. Two factors, evident at a late phase following injury (after the 1st week posttrauma), namely late epilepsy and communicating hydrocephalus, were also significant in predicting nonrecovery.\r"

Almost half of the patients were independent in activities of daily living and another 20% were only partially dependent. Cognitive and behavioral deficits were the most common central nervous system sequelae of injury. Eight patients (11.1%) were able to resume working in the open job market and 35 (48.6%) were engaged in sheltered workshops. Most of the patients (72%), including all those who were working, were living with their families. Although the mean rehabilitation period was about 15 months, over 70% of these severely injured patients are considered to be socially integrated, enabling them to enjoy a reasonable quality of life.\r"

  ".W": "Language impairments were reviewed retrospectively in patients who underwent partial or total corpus callosum section for medically refractory secondary generalized epilepsy. Postoperatively, four of 32 patients had clinically significant language impairments that were not present prior to the operation. All involved primarily verbal output (speech and writing) and spared verbal comprehension. Written language skills (reading and spelling), verbal memory, and verbal reasoning abilities were impaired to varying degrees. These impairments were associated with crossed cerebral dominance. Three patients with severe difficulties after surgery were right hemisphere-dominant for speech and were right-handed. One left hemisphere speech-dominant, left-handed patient was agraphic after surgery, but spoke normally. It is concluded from these data and from other reports in the literature that three syndromes of language disturbance may follow callosotomy. The first, involving speech difficulty but but sparing writing, is attributable to buccofacial apraxia. The second involves speech and writing difficulties and occurs in right hemisphere-dominant right-handed patients. The third involves dysgraphia with intact speech and occurs in left hemisphere-dominant left-handed patients.\r"

Compared to those who did not, patients who developed postcraniotomy hematoma (PCH) had a significantly higher incidence of evidence of alcohol intake and preoperative mannitol administration; a higher percentage had a bad outcome. Coagulopathy was frequent in PCH patients. Although three-quarters of the initial hematomas were intradural, 69% of the PCH's were predominantly extradural. The large potential space underlying a craniotomy bone flap may predispose to development of a PCH. Intracranial pressure (ICP) was monitored in 39 of the 59 PCH patients, which allowed earlier detection of the PCH in 22 (56%). In 17 patients, the ICP failed to rise despite clinical deterioration, and detection of the PCH was delayed, significantly worsening the outcome in this group.\r"

The motor activity of the monkey was measured with a telemetry system during the experiment. After experimental parkinsonism was induced by repeated intravenous injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), three monkeys were treated with autologous transplantation of the SCG into both caudate nuclei. One monkey served as a control without SCG transplantation after MPTP treatment. Three SCG-transplanted monkeys showed biphasic (acute and chronic) behavioral amelioration of parkinsonism after transplantation. In the acute stage, the animals showed transient hyperkinesia with aggressive behavior and loss of circadian rhythm. In the chronic stage following acute hyperkinesia, the animals regained normal behavior and circadian rhythm without aggressiveness. In contrast with the transplanted monkeys, the control monkey failed to show recovery of the bradykinesia and muscle rigidity.\r"

A vincristine (VCR)-resistant glioma cell line showed a cross resistance to Adriamycin (doxorubicin, ADR) and etoposide (VP-16) to varying extents, suggesting the presence of MDR; the resistance to VCR was considerably decreased by calcium entry blockers. On the other hand, another VCR-sensitive glioma cell line exhibited no cross resistance to ADR or VP-16. Double minute chromosomes and homogeneously staining regions as well as clonal aberrations of chromosome 7 were not observed in cytogenetic studies of multidrug-resistant and multidrug-sensitive glioma cell lines. In Northern and Southern blot analyses, MDR gene 1 (MDR1) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was shown to be overexpressed without any amplification of the MDR1 gene in multidrug-resistant glioma cell lines as compared to multidrug-sensitive glioma cell lines. It would be reasonable to suggest that amplification of the MDR1 gene may not be a sine qua non for acquisition of MDR and that the MDR1 mRNA level may be correlated with the extent of MDR.\r"
