We analyzed clones spanning the entire J alpha region extending 115 kilobases 5' of the TCR alpha-chain constant region and have shown that the TCR delta-chain gene is located over 80 kilobases 5' of C alpha. TCR delta-chain gene is rearranged in the gamma/delta-expressing T-cell line Peer and is deleted in alpha/beta-expressing T-cell lines. Sequence analysis of portions of this genomic region demonstrates its identity with previously described cDNA clones corresponding to the C delta and J delta segments. Furthermore, we have analyzed a t(8;14)-(q24;q11) chromosome translocation from a T-cell leukemia and have shown that the J delta segment is rearranged in cells deriving from this tumor and probably directly involved in the translocation. Thus, the newly cloned TCR delta chain is implicated in the genesis of chromosome translocations in T-cell malignancies carrying cytogenetic abnormalities of band 14q11.\r"

Seven spontaneous revertants examined fall into two different classes. Three of these revertants arose by homologous recombination between the two gypsy long terminal repeats (LTRs), leaving behind a solo LTR. Four additional revertants contain an intact 3' LTR and half of the 5' LTR, but the central portion of gypsy has been replaced by a different 6.5-kilobase transposable element that contains a poly(A) tail. These results suggest that the mutagenic effect of the gypsy element is not due to its insertion into sequences necessary for transcription or to the distancing between the yellow promoter and remote regulatory sequences but is a consequence of idiosyncratic properties of the element itself.\r"

Ppb interacts in a dominant way with mutations in the sevenless (sev) gene, an X-chromosomal gene necessary for photoreceptor cell 7 differentiation in the Drosophila retina. Specific alleles of sev alter the Ppb behavioral phenotype; of eight sev alleles tested, two alleles enhanced the negative phototaxis of Ppb, whereas six alleles had the opposite effect. In no mutant combination of Ppb and sev was photoreceptor cell 7 restored. These data show that the sev gene, in addition to its role in the differentiation of photoreceptor cell 7, plays a role along with Ppb in a common visual information-processing pathway.\r"

Targeting the low-affinity IL-2-binding p55 subunit of the high-affinity IL-2R with the rat anti-mouse IgM monoclonal antibody M7/20 suppresses a variety of T-cell-mediated reactions, including transplant rejection, autoimmunity, and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). A hybrid IL-2-toxin gene was constructed from the diphtheria toxin gene by replacing the DNA encoding the diphtheria toxin receptor-binding domain with the DNA encoding the receptor-binding domain of IL-2, and the fusion protein encoded by the hybrid gene was expressed in Escherichia coli [Williams, D.P., Parker, K., Bacha, P., Bishai, W., Borowski, M., Genbauffe, F., Strom, T.B. & Murphy, J.R. (1987) Protein Eng. 1, 493-498]. We examined the action of the chimeric IL-2-toxin fusion protein on an in vivo T-cell mediated response, DTH. The IL-2-toxin fusion protein was found to be a potent immunosuppressive agent. Treatment of mice with the IL-2-toxin blocks DTH and prevents expansion of IL-2R+ T cells. Indeed, IL-2-toxin treatment targets IL-2R+ T cells in vivo and is shown to selectively eliminate their appearance in draining lymph nodes. DTH suppression was observed even in mice possessing high titers of antibodies to diphtheria toxoid.\r"

We found that the CD8 molecule is noncovalently associated with the HLA class I heavy chain on the surface of human T cells activated by Con A. Accordingly, anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies precipitated a heterodimer containing polypeptides of 32 and 43 kDa from the lysates of activated T cells. The 43-kDa chain of this heterodimer can be adsorbed from cell lysates with anti-HLA-A, -B, and -C antibodies. Endoglycosidase F treatment and chymotryptic peptide mapping identified a structural similarity between this 43-kDa molecule and the HLA class I heavy chain precipitated by the anti-HLA-A, -B, and -C antibody W6/32. Analysis of anti-CD8 precipitates under nonreducing and reducing conditions indicated a lack of interchain disulfide bonding between the CD8 and HLA heavy chain molecules. The CD8-HLA heavy chain complex was also detected in mixed lymphocyte cultures and a cloned cytotoxic T-lymphocyte line but not in purified natural killer cells. The present study indicates that CD8 is complexed with HLA heavy chain on the same cells, and the complex may have functional relevance in the T-cell recognition process.\r"

Depletion of a lysosome-rich cell population, containing large granular lymphocytes, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells, and a subset of CD8-positive T cells, was shown to be crucial before the cells could be immunized in vitro. This depletion was accomplished by treating the peripheral blood lymphocytes with the lysosomotropic agent L-leucine methyl ester. In addition, the in vitro immunization had to be supported by interleukin 2, gamma-interferon, and B-cell growth and differentiation factors, derived from irradiated, pokeweed-mitogen-stimulated human T cells. The production of human monoclonal antibodies from primary, antigen-specifically activated peripheral lymphocytes might obviate the need to immunize volunteers or patients.\r"

To study it on a biochemical level, a simple large-scale method was developed to purify the Mr 32,000 Rh protein from multiple units of Rh(D)-positive and -negative blood. Erythrocyte membrane vesicles were solubilized in NaDodSO4, and a tracer of immunoprecipitated 125I surface-labeled Rh protein was added. The Rh protein was purified to homogeneity by hydroxylapatite chromatography followed by preparative NaDodSO4/PAGE. Approximately 25 nmol of pure Rh protein was recovered from each unit of Rh(D)-positive and -negative blood. Rh protein purified from both Rh phenotypes appeared similar by one-dimensional NaDodSO4/PAGE, and the N-terminal amino acid sequences for the first 20 residues were identical. Rh proteins purified from Rh(D)-positive and -negative blood were compared by two-dimensional iodopeptide mapping after 125I-labeling and alpha-chymotrypsin digestion. The peptide maps were very similar; however, at least two additional iodopeptides were consistently noted in the Rh proteins purified from Rh(D)-positive erythrocytes. These data indicate that a similar core Rh protein (or group of related proteins) exists in both Rh(D)-positive and -negative erythrocytes, and the Rh proteins from erythrocytes with different Rh phenotypes contain distinct structural polymorphisms.\r"

The cDNA encodes a protein of 352 amino acids that contains a characteristic amino acid repeat in its carboxyl-terminal half. This protein is highly homologous to the sequence of the mouse microtubule-associated protein tau and thus constitutes the human equivalent of mouse tau. RNA blot analysis indicates the presence of two major transcripts, 6 and 2 kilobases lon g, with a wide distribution in normal human brain. Tau protein mRNAs were found in normal amounts in the frontal cortex from patients with Alzheimer disease. The proof that at least part of tau protein forms a component of the paired helical filament core opens the way to understanding the mode of formation of paired helical filaments and thus, ultimately, the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.\r"

Although the aging process is not well understood at the molecular level, recent observations suggest that quantitative changes in gene expression occur as these fruit flies approach senescence. Such genetic alterations are in accord with our present data, which clearly show marked differences in the synthesis of heat shock proteins between young and old fruit flies. In 10-day-old flies, a heat shock of 20 min results in the expression of 14 new proteins as detectable by two-dimensional electrophoresis of [35S]methionine-labeled polypeptides, whereas identical treatment of 45-day-old flies leads to the expression of at least 50 new or highly up-regulated proteins. In addition, there is also a concomitant increase in the rate of synthesis of a number of the normal proteins in the older animals. Microdensitometric determinations of the low molecular weight heat shock polypeptides on autoradiographs of five age groups revealed that their maximum expression occurs at 47 days for a population of flies with a mean life span of 33.7 days. Moreover, a heat shock effect similar to that observed in senescent flies occurs in young flies fed canavanine, an arginine analogue, before heat shock.\r"

A 3.4-kilobase (kb) fragment containing sequences on the 5' side of the ANF gene promoted significant CAT activity in atrial but not ventricular cardiocytes derived from 1-day-old rats. Deletion analysis of putative regulatory regions demonstrated that 2.4 kb of 5' ANF sequences were sufficient for high-level atrial transcription, whereas hybrid genes containing less than 700 base pairs of ANF sequences promoted less CAT activity. Cardiocytes derived from embryonic ventricles expressed the 3.4-kb ANF-CAT hybrid gene at levels comparable to atrial cells, suggesting that the nucleotide sequences controlling developmental regulation of ANF expression are contained in this 5' region. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this 3.6-kb region identified segments that may contribute to the regulated expression of the ANF gene.\r"

[Ca2+] was measured with fura-2 and a high time-resolution dual-wavelength digital microfluorimeter, and force was measured with an ultrasensitive force transducer attached to a probe around which was tied one end of the cell. Both [Ca2+] and force increase after maximal electrical stimulus, with [Ca2+] increasing considerably before the first detectable increase in force. Force development exhibited maximal sensitivity to [Ca2+] between 150 and 500 nM Ca2+. This Ca2+ sensitivity can account for the fact that many physiological stimuli produce full contraction even though such stimuli only increase Ca2+ to 600-800 nM. When Ca2+ was induced to increase rapidly, the relation between [Ca2+] and force exhibited hysteresis. During the onset of contraction, force at a given [Ca2+] was lower than during the muscle's return to rest, thus suggesting the existence of a slow step(s) linking Ca2+ and force development in smooth muscle. The direction of this hysteresis reversed during contractions in which Ca2+ increased slowly, suggesting that the contractile process becomes desensitized to [Ca2+] with time. These relations between calcium and force in intact single smooth-muscle cells differ in many respects from the relation found previously in chemically permeabilized multicellular preparations of smooth muscle.\r"

Because HIV infection is not readily or uniformly ascertained, survey methods and sentinel surveillance approaches must be used. At least some of the surveys must be blinded, that is, anonymous and unlinked to identifiable persons, to avoid the uninterpretable impact of self-selection bias that could lead to both significant underestimates and occasional overestimates of HIV prevalence. Other surveys must be nonblinded, with careful interviews of volunteer participants to evaluate risk factors for HIV infection. These various surveys must continue over time to evaluate trends in infection. A comprehensive family of complementary HIV surveys and studies and a national household-based HIV seroprevalence survey have been undertaken by the Public Health Service in collaboration with other Federal agencies, State and local health departments, blood collection agencies, and medical research institutions. These projects focus on accessible segments of the general population, childbearing women, persons at high risk for HIV, and persons in special settings such as prisons and colleges. This comprehensive surveillance approach will help monitor the levels and trends of HIV infection in the United States and help prioritize, target, and evaluate HIV prevention activities.\r"

The Surgeon General of the Public Health Service has challenged the United Nations to make the world's blood supply safe by 1991. Private and public sector leaders could come together, apply the technology and resources available in industrialized countries, and achieve a victory in this facet of the AIDS pandemic. The WHO's global strategy has led to the establishment of national AIDS committees in 151 countries and the preparation of 70 short-term (6-12 months) plans and 25 medium-term (3-5 years) plans for national AIDS control programs.\r"

  ".W": "The discovery of effective therapies for HIV requires a fundamental knowledge of retroviral infections. Research by the Public Health Service and collaborating organizations on oncogenic viruses, including retroviruses, has provided much of the basic understanding of retroviruses in general and anti-retroviral therapeutic strategies in particular. Early work by the Viral Cancer and Developmental Therapeutic Programs of the National Cancer Institute and the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has contributed much of the current understanding of AIDS and its therapy. This paper describes the progress that has been made in the treatment of AIDS and the programs that have been created to develop future therapies. These programs include efforts to screen existing compounds for activity against HIV, to design new anti-HIV therapies, and to test potential agents in controlled clinical trials. As a result of these activities, researchers have identified one drug, AZT, that has proven effective in prolonging the lives of some patients with AIDS, and are developing several other promising compounds. The key question no longer is whether HIV infection can be treated, but what is the best and fastest way to develop new therapies and improve existing ones.\r"

Although a great deal has been learned about HIV in a few short years, the development of an AIDS vaccine has proved to be extremely difficult. The lack of an appropriate animal model for AIDS, the absence of a defined protective immune response in persons infected with HIV, the long latent period between initial infection and the development of symptoms, the existence of multiple strains of HIV, and the spread of HIV by way of cell-associated virus are issues that complicate the development of an effective AIDS vaccine. Researchers are employing a multifaceted approach to the creation of a potential AIDS vaccine. These approaches include the use of killed or attenuated virus, purified natural or synthetic subunits of the virus, infectious recombinant viruses, and anti-idiotypes. The first clinical trial of a subunit AIDS vaccine began in September 1987 at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Through support of basic research on AIDS vaccine development and the establishment of a mechanism for clinical trials of candidate vaccines, NIH is pursuing multiple approaches toward the goal of a vaccine against AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Present safeguards for the blood supply consist of three tiers of protection: donor deferral based on a donor's history of risk factors, confidential exclusion of blood units from donors with self-admitted risk factors, and testing of the blood itself. Before the discovery of the AIDS virus in 1983 and 1984, there was no specific test relevant to AIDS that could be used to help improve the safety of the blood supply. The first step was intensified efforts, based on what was then known of the epidemiology of the disease, to take donor histories to identify risk factors. The first specific tests were for the detection of antibodies to the virus and came into use in 1985. The general features of AIDS are described, together with the scientific rationale for the various types of laboratory tests, those for the virus itself, antigens, antibodies, the genetic material of the virus, and T4 lymphocytes. General characteristics of the tests are reviewed. Since testing began, about 30 million units each of blood and plasma have been screened. More than 3,000 infected persons in the blood donor group have been identified as HIV-antibody positive. Thirteen cases of transfusion-associated infection have been documented. They are believed to have occurred because a detectable level of antibodies had not yet formed in the infected donors. Currently, such transmission is thought to occur once in about 40,000 to 250,000 donations, a dramatic improvement from 1983.\r"

In particular, the agency has established a special designation--1-AA--for a potential AIDS product which gives top priority to its review. This special expedited review process for AIDS products has provided for greater cooperation between their sponsors and FDA's reviewers. AIDS products also receive prompt consideration for orphan product status--a status providing financial incentives to the developers of treatments for certain rare and complex diseases. FDA's special procedures for AIDS drugs have resulted in several major advances in available AIDS treatments. Foremost among these was the FDA's review and approval of zidovudine (commonly known as AZT) as the first effective palliative for AIDS within 107 days--an agency record. Similarly, the agency quickly evaluated and approved ELISA and Western blot diagnostic kits for detecting the presence of HIV antibody. These test kits have made an important contribution to safeguarding the nation's blood supply. The agency has also instituted new \"treatment\" investigational new drug regulations to allow earlier pre-approval distribution of promising experimental treatments to patients with immediately life-threatening conditions, including persons with AIDS. Under this system and its earlier prototype, eligible AIDS patients were able to receive pre-approval treatment with zidovudine and trimetrexate (an experimental drug for the treatment of AIDS patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who have experienced severe adverse reactions using standard approved therapies). The agency has made institutional reforms to effectively streamline the review of candidate AIDS treatments and vaccines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This retrovirus causes profound immunoincompetence in its infected hosts, who are thereafter susceptible to develop myriad severe and relapsing protozoal, fungal, bacterial, viral, and arthropodal opportunistic infections, as well as unusual malignancies. The more than 50,000 patients who have developed AIDS in the United States have produced a sudden unexpected deluge of diagnostic dilemmas that are stressing laboratories of pathology everywhere. This paper describes the gross and microscopic pathology of the numerous complications in patients infected by HIV: (a) the prodromal AIDS-related complex with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, (b) lymphoid infiltration of salivary gland and lung, including the complex of lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis-pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia, (c) extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, (d) multifocal mucocutaneous and visceral Kaposi's sarcoma, (e) small cell undifferentiated (oat cell) carcinomas, (f) protozoal infections caused by Pneumocystis carinii, Toxoplasma gondii, Acanthamoeba, Cryptosporidium species (sp.), and Isospora belli, (g) the causes of chronic enteritis, (h) mycotic infections caused by Candida sp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, and Sporothrix schenckii, (i) bacterial infections caused by Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, M. tuberculosis, M. kansasii, Nocardia sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Legionella sp., Treponema pallidum, and others, (j) viral infections caused by cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex and zoster, polyomavirus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), hepatitis B, molluscum contagiosum, and papillomavirus, (k) oral hairy leukoplakia, (l) subacute encephalopathy, and (m) Norwegian scabies.\r"

Even though there is no vaccine or effective treatment, HIV infection can be prevented through behavioral change. As the lead Public Health Service Agency for disease prevention, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has designed and implemented information and education activities with the ultimate goal of preventing HIV infection and AIDS in the United States. The target populations include the general public, school- and college-aged populations, persons infected or at increased risk of infection, minorities, and health workers. Because AIDS will be with us for a long time, CDC views educating the public as a long-term undertaking. The agency has initiated an intensive continuing national public information campaign, an informational brochure to be distributed to every U.S. household, a national AIDS information toll-free hotline, and a clearinghouse system that will maintain a comprehensive inventory of AIDS information resources and services. CDC also supports public information and education efforts by State and local health agencies. To reach school- and college-age youth, CDC, in consultation with governmental and national private sector organizations, developed guidelines for effective school health education to assist school health personnel in determining the scope and content of AIDS education. CDC also works with State and local education agencies to help carry out and evaluate educational efforts to prevent the spread of HIV among school- and college-age youth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Directors of State health agencies (State health officers) have asserted their influence at the national level as well as at the State level. The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), and especially ASTHO'S AIDS Committee, has served as the primary vehicle through which State health officers communicate their views to the Federal Government and vice versa. To date, ASTHO has held four national conferences on AIDS. Each one has brought together Federal, State, and local officials, advocacy groups, and other public health experts, and each has resulted in practical recommendations to public health departments on how to implement their AIDS programs most effectively. Although State health agencies have responded differently to the epidemic, many have adopted innovative, and sometimes unpopular, approaches. State health agencies' responses to the AIDS epidemic are governed partly by environmental factors, including the views of political leaders in the State, the strength of concerned advocacy groups, and the number of AIDS cases in the State. Despite their different approaches, State health officers have agreed that education is the most important tool in their programs to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The rapidly changing AIDS epidemic has required State health agencies to be flexible in their approaches to controlling the epidemic. State health officers' evolving views about HIV testing and partner notification are two examples of how new information about the epidemic has affected States' HIV control programs.\r"

Early work focused on preventing infection in the health care setting with the use of the Centers for Disease Control's recommended precautions concerning blood and body fluids. Supporting this effort were a number of live teleconferences, videotapes, and publications that addressed the use of precautions with AIDS patients, community issues associated with the disease, and the development of employee policies. In July 1987, a Special Committee on AIDS/HIV Infection Policy was formed by the AHA Board of Trustees and charged with developing recommendations on the issues that needed to be addressed if hospitals were to continue to meet the challenge of AIDS effectively. The committee's first set of recommendations, approved in November 1987, reaffirmed the use of universal precautions, provided guidance on the appropriate uses and application of HIV testing, and stated that the delivery of care should not be conditioned on the willingness of a patient to undergo testing. The second set of recommendations, which were approved in January 1988, focused on the need to distribute the responsibility for AIDS care among a wide variety of health care providers, to seek creative financing approaches that involve both the private and public sectors, and called on hospitals to provide leadership in ensuring that a continuum of services is available to AIDS patients. Continuing efforts to assist hospitals in the care delivery issues associated with AIDS are described.\r"

Nurses are and will continue to be responsible for administering the major portion of the direct health care that AIDS patients require and for teaching basic nursing skills to other care givers. According to a 1987 survey of 461 nursing programs conducted by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, AIDS content is being incorporated into the curriculums of the majority of programs that responded. Students require an in-depth knowledge of AIDS to enable them to address effectively the needs of AIDS patients and their families. Because of the complex psychosocial, ethical, and legal issues, careful attention must be given to the development of students' skills in making clinical decisions that will promote effective nursing intervention when addressing problems in nursing care. Curriculums should also include assessment of the special needs of members of minority groups that are disproportionately affected by AIDS. Schools of nursing in colleges and universities can serve as key resources for developing curriculums, policies, and practice patterns that will assist the nursing community and the public in responding to the AIDS epidemic.\r"

Although the primary etiologic agent of AIDS, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has been identified and the major means by which the virus is transmitted--sexual contact, use of contaminated needles by IV drug abusers, perinatally, and through blood or blood products--are also known, no vaccines or specific therapies to combat the disease are available as yet. The AIDS crisis underscores the absolute necessity for the continuing support of the biomedical research enterprise in its many forms and settings and calls for an all-out effort in educating the world community about the means of preventing and controlling the disease. The American Medical Association (AMA) has accepted the challenge to be in the forefront of this war on AIDS. In two recent reports adopted by its House of Delegates, the AMA has urged that a judicious balance be established between the well-being of HIV-positive patients and the protection of the public health. Education is identified as the major weapon currently available against the spread of this disease, and physicians are urged to assume the leadership role in educating themselves, their patients, and the public. In proposing 17 recommendations for physician, governmental, community, and public involvement and presenting an aggressive action agenda for the future, the AMA emphasizes the need for concerted and cooperative efforts by all members of society in the fight against AIDS.\r"

Those actions derived from, and support the continuation, expansion, and replication of, initiatives at the community and State levels. HRSA is carrying out many of the recommendations of the Intragovernmental Task Force on AIDS Health Care Delivery by enhancing the AIDS training of health care personnel in prevention, diagnosis, and care and by counseling and encouraging the expansion of facilities outside hospitals to care for AIDS patients. The agency, through its pediatric AIDS demonstration projects, is working on models for the care of children with HIV infections. The needs of AIDS patients are being addressed through a drug therapy reimbursement program; demonstration grants to 13 projects to promote coordinated, integrated systems of care in the community; and grants for the development of intermediate and long-term care facilities for patients. Ten regional education and training centers, funded in 1987 and 1988, will increase the supply of health care providers prepared to diagnose and treat persons with HIV infections. Programs will be conducted for several thousand providers over the next 3 years, using such modalities as televised programs and train-the-trainer courses.

The traditional medical model, with its emphasis on inpatient hospital care, is expensive and fails to address other needs of people with AIDS (PWAs). This paper outlines an alternative model: the community-based response, or continuum-of-care model. It builds on earlier community models of an integrated network of service providers who can better meet a range of needs of PWAs outside the hospital. Although the model may include a designated hospital AIDS unit that supplies inpatient services, the continuum-of-care model incorporates other nonacute and psychosocial services offered through community-based providers, and these services rely to a large extent on volunteers. Nationwide, more than 400 community-based AIDS service organizations have been formed in response to the growing AIDS epidemic, or have evolved from existing organizations. The National AIDS Network (NAN) was formed in 1985 by five such organizations to represent at the national level the vision of community-based AIDS care. As the nexus for a national community-based response, NAN acts as a conduit for service providers to share experience as well as a clearinghouse for information and programs.\r"

In fiscal year 1988, Medicaid will spend between $700 and $750 million for AIDS care and treatment. Medicaid spending on AIDS is likely to reach $2.4 billion by fiscal year 1992, an estimate that does not include costs of treatment with zidovudine (AZT). Four policy principles are proposed for meeting this new cost burden in a way that is fair, responsive, efficient, and in harmony with our current joint public-private system of health care financing. The four guidelines are to (a) treat AIDS as any other serious disease, without the creation of a disease-specific entitlement program; (b) bring AIDS treatment financing into the mainstream of the health care financing system, making it a shared responsibility and promoting initiatives such as high-risk insurance pools: (c) give States the flexibility to meet local needs, including Medicaid home care and community-based care services waivers; (d) encourage health care professionals to meet their obligation to care for AIDS patients.\r"

This is the first study to include the cost of purchasing azidothymidine (AZT), also called zidovudine, a palliative treatment for AIDS. The forecasts of this study are lower than those reported by Rice and Scitovsky, and other researchers, because the data are more recent and AIDS patients are receiving more care on an outpatient basis and staying in the hospital fewer days. They are also lower because projections for the number of AIDS cases diagnosed in future years are lower than those made by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This study projects that about 38,000 AIDS cases will be diagnosed in 1988 and 73,000 in 1991. The projections in this study are derived using data on the number of AIDS cases reported to CDC from January 1984 to October 1987, while the CDC projections employed by Rice and Scitovsky were derived using data from June 1981 to May 1986. It is also projected that the lifetime cost of treating an AIDS patient will increase from $57,000 in 1988 to $61,800 in 1991 due to the wider use of AZT.\r"

  ".W": "A large body of evidence has accumulated indicating that viruses can predispose animal and human hosts to secondary local and systemic bacterial and fungal disease. The mechanism by which viruses cause these superinfections involves both a direct effect of viruses on the tissues at the site of infection and alterations in cells involved in immune surveillance. The effect of viruses on lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages has recently been reviewed. A number of viruses have been shown to depress various functions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which are critical for controlling bacterial and fungal infections. The alterations in functions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes induced by different viruses include abnormalities of adherence, chemotaxis, phagocytic, oxidative, secretory, and bactericidal activities. The effect of various viruses on neutrophils and the role that virus-induced neutrophil dysfunction has in predisposing the host to secondary infections are reviewed.\r"

A T lymphocyte product, IL-2 also stimulates T cells to undergo cell cycle progression via a finite number of interactions with its specific membrane receptors. Because T cell clonal proliferation after antigen challenge is obligatory for immune responsiveness and immune memory, the IL-2-T cell system has opened the way to a molecular understanding of phenomena that are fundamental to biology, immunology, and medicine.\r"

  ".W": "Ion channel proteins are important for the conduction of ions across biological membranes. Recent analyses of their sequences have suggested that they are composed of bundles of alpha-helices that associate to form ion-conducting channels. To gain insight into the mechanisms by which alpha-helices can aggregate and conduct ions, three model peptides containing only leucine and serine residues were synthesized and characterized. A 21-residue peptide, H2N-(Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Leu-Ser-Leu)3-CONH2, which was designed to be a membrane-spanning amphiphilic alpha-helix, formed well-defined ion channels with ion permeability and lifetime characteristics resembling the acetylcholine receptor. In contrast, a 14-residue version of this peptide, which was too short to span the phospolipid bilayer as an alpha-helix, failed to form discrete, stable channels. A third peptide, H2N-(Leu-Ser-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ser-Leu)3-CONH2, in which one serine per heptad repeat was replaced by leucine, produced proton-selective channels. Computer graphics and energy minimization were used to create molecular models that were consistent with the observed properties of the channels.\r"

Induced free-living trophonts of L. clarki undergo a synchronous response in which cells divide and transform into parasitic cells (theronts) that encyst on larval predators. Parasitic ciliates penetrate the cuticle, enter the hemocoel, and ultimately kill their predator-host. In nature, this trophic shift can lead to predator extinction and dramatic changes in microbial populations. Facultative parasitism by this polymorphic ciliate may have evolved as an antipredator strategy. The experimentally inducible parasitic response of L. clarki provides a novel model for studying cellular morphogenesis of ciliated protozoa.\r"

The two receptors are homologous with each other, rhodopsin, and other receptors coupled to guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins and they contain seven hydrophobic domains, which may represent transmembrane spanning segments. The function of specific structural domains of these receptors was determined after construction and expression of a series of chimeric alpha 2-,beta 2-adrenergic receptor genes. The specificity for coupling to the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein lies within a region extending from the amino terminus of the fifth hydrophobic domain to the carboxyl terminus of the sixth. Major determinants of alpha 2- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist and antagonist ligand binding specificity are contained within the seventh membrane spanning domain. Chimeric receptors should prove useful for elucidating the structural basis of receptor function.\r"

Three hours after the onset of stimulation, focal nuclear Fos staining was seen in motor and sensory thalamus, pontine nuclei, globus pallidus, and cerebellum. Moreover, 24-hour water deprivation resulted in Fos expression in paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Fos immunohistochemistry therefore provides a cellular method to label polysynaptically activated neurons and thereby map functional pathways.\r"

Respiratory-competent transformants were obtained in which the introduced oxi3 DNA is integrated at the homologous site in the mitochondrial genome. Organelle genomes can now be manipulated by molecular genetic techniques in the same way as nuclear genomes.\r"

Under local or general anesthesia a No. 18 red rubber catheter with multiple openings cut into the distal 8 to 10 cm is passed through a stab wound in the antrum of the stomach and directed cephalad to a point 5 cm from the wall of the fundus. The stomach wall is closed around the tube by the Stamm technique, and the tube is then passed through an adjacent stab wound in the abdominal wall. The gastric serosa is sutured to the peritoneum, and the tube is immobilized by a nonabsorbable suture through the skin and tied around the tube. In our series, 1,072 patients had gastrostomy done by this technique either for postoperative decompression (965) or feeding (107). Fifteen complications occurred in procedures done for decompression and three in those done for feeding. The complications did not alter the surgical result or the hospital stay.\r"

  ".W": "Tracheal intubation for airway control, once done only by anesthesiologists during surgical procedures, is now being done by physicians in other specialties and by nurses, technicians, and paramedics in areas other than the operating room. Intubation, however, does not always assure a patent airway. Unrecognized esophageal placement of endotracheal tubes is the major cause of cardiac arrest and brain damage associated with intubation. Though auscultation for breath sounds is the universally accepted method of verifying proper tube placement, recent studies indicate that it is reliable only approximately two thirds of the time in situations in which verification of proper placement is needed most and is least obvious. The usefulness of this technique merits reassessment. Identification of carbon dioxide in end-expired air is the most reliable method for verification, but instruments to detect carbon dioxide are usually immediately available only in special care and surgical suites. Mouth-to-tube insufflation with a two-way disposable microbial filter differentiates immediately between esophageal and tracheal placement and can be used in any area. Malpositioned and malfunctioning tubes cause partial or complete obstruction accompanied by varying degrees of hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Respiratory and circulatory derangements and brain damage ensue if the problem is not promptly recognized and corrected. We discuss the most common causes of tube malfunction.\r"

  ".W": "The use of laser therapy for endobronchial lesions has met with general enthusiasm. From published series it is difficult to determine specific indications for its use, based upon patients' complaints, locations of tumor, and any concomitant therapies. Most reports do not provide sufficient information to permit adequate comparisons regarding improvement in symptoms and long-term efficacy. Exophytic lesions of the trachea and mainstem bronchi are most amenable to therapy by laser, and improvement in symptoms correlates best with improved patency of large airways. In most patients the major portion of the endobronchial debulking procedure can be performed quickly and safely by physically coring out the exophytic tumor mass with the rigid end of the bronchoscope. A large biopsy forceps can help accomplish this with very little bleeding. The laser can then remove any remaining tumor and produce hemostasis by coagulation of the tumor bed. The major purpose of laser therapy is to lessen or completely relieve symptoms of airway obstruction. Laser therapy to obstructed lobar or segmental bronchi rarely reduces symptoms unless they are associated with post-obstructive pneumonia. When the obstruction is longstanding, laser ablation may fail to establish airway patency. Hemoptysis from exophytic lesions can usually be well controlled. Treatment of lesions that produce extrinsic compression of the trachea or bronchi is of little value. At present, laser therapy is one of several treatments available for neoplastic endotracheal or endobronchial obstruction. Other local therapies include external-beam irradiation, cryotherapy, electrocoagulative therapy, and intraluminal brachytherapy with insertion of afterloading catheters. Most of these modalities are available in large oncologic centers, and it will take the better part of the next decade to identify specific indications for each of these therapies individually and in combination. Currently, Nd:YAG therapy has an established role in the palliative treatment of obstructive endobronchial disease. Response rates to therapy with relief of obstruction are in the range of 80 to 85 per cent. Nd:YAG therapy is easy, quick, and, with proper caution, safe. In the majority of cases it must be repeated on one or several occasions. Photodynamic therapy is now being critically evaluated for the treatment of similar lesions.\r"

Of 67 patients admitted with complications of Crohn's disease, 51 had severe active disease and abdominal masses, fistulas and/or obstruction (mean Crohn's disease activity index score, 301). Forty-four patients received preoperative TPN for a mean period of 33 days. Complications of TPN were limited. Spontaneous closure of fistulas was achieved in 75% of the cases. Serum albumin levels improved significantly, from 29.1 +/- 1.1 gm/L to 35.4 +/- 0.7 gm/L (p less than 0.001). Mean body weights improved from 81% to 89% ideal body weights or 52.6 kg to 57.2 kg, respectively (p less than 0.05). Surgical procedures were facilitated by remission of the active inflammatory process and associated with a major complications rate of only 6%. No deaths occurred. the mean hospital stay for the TPN-treated group of patients was 63 days. TPN is an effective preoperative treatment for patients with severe complicated Crohn's disease. The prolonged hospital stay and high costs, however, are disadvantages of this approach. Preoperative TPN treatment should therefore be limited to patients with severe active disease.\r"

Ischemic territories were clearly identified on autoradiograms as sharply demarcated areas with reduced radioactivity. The localization of regions with reduced protein biosynthesis correlated with the early postembolic suppression of evoked potentials but not with the (improved) functional state and the morphologic alterations at the end of the experiment. Suppression of amino acid incorporation, in consequence, is a long-lasting event that allows documentation of the initial embolic impact for at least 2 hours irrespective of the subsequent recovery process.\r"

We reviewed our experience with 622 consecutive cases of renal injury to find the most economical diagnostic sequence with the clearest findings. An intravenous pyelography (IVP) still is the first and mostly the sole examination to do in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of renal trauma. Microscopic hematuria alone is no longer an indication to perform urography. If indicated, an IVP should be performed as an emergency procedure in all cases and especially in the patient with multiple trauma. Children are more susceptible to renal trauma and require a higher index of suspicion. In the few patients with indeterminate findings on urography, renal angiography must be considered (especially when renal pedicle injury is suspected) or a computerized tomography (CT) scan (especially in the patient with multiple trauma). Ultrasound and CT examinations are not to be done on a routine basis in the initial assessment or the follow-up of renal trauma.\r"

Sixteen patients received 200 mg alprenolol twice daily and 17 received placebo. There were no statistically significant differences between the parameters in the two groups after one year on medication. However, when medication was stopped, the ratio of apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A-I fell by 9% in the alprenolol group and increased by 2% in the placebo group. This difference was statistically significant. Our results suggest that alprenolol, a beta-blocker with weak intrinsic sympathomimetic effect, has slight effects on plasma lipoproteins.

To examine these effects, systemic and coronary hemodynamic responses were measured continuously before and during brief periods of myocardial ischemia induced by left anterior descending coronary balloon occlusion in 26 patients undergoing angioplasty (PTCA). Data were compared for two matched occlusion periods, one control and one \"drug\" occlusion. In 17 patients (NTG group), 200 micrograms of intracoronary NTG was given immediately before coronary occlusion. In nine patients (NIF group), 10 mg of sublingual NIF was given 15 minutes before the \"drug\" occlusion. NTG significantly but transiently reduced mean arterial pressure (91 +/- 11 to 82 +/- 15 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and augmented basal coronary blood flow (95 +/- 38 to 127 +/- 54 ml/min, p less than 0.05) but did not alter great vein blood flow (59 +/- 29 vs 61 +/- 29 ml/min) or coronary occlusion pressure (25 +/- 7 to 24 +/- 7 mm Hg) during ischemia. NIF significantly reduced systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure (119 +/- 21 to 95 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and heart rate-pressure product from control.

  ".W": "Synthetic analogues of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) have been developed for potential use as therapeutic agents in the treatment of congestive heart failure and hypertension. We studied the effects of 14 intravenous infusions of synthetic ANF (anaritide, human ANF 102-126) on coronary hemodynamics and myocardial energetics in six patients with heart failure. ANF infusion caused no change in coronary blood flow and a fall in coronary vascular resistance from 1.22 +/- 0.22 to 1.08 +/- 0.18 mm Hg-min/ml (p less than 0.05). Myocardial oxygen and lactate consumption were unchanged from baseline values. Mean arterial pressure fell from 91 +/- 4 to 78 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), right atrial pressure fell from 10 +/- 1 to 8 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure fell from 21 +/- 3 to 16 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), heart rate and cardiac index were unchanged, and systemic vascular resistance fell from 1346 +/- 130 to 1087 +/- 98 dyne-sec/cm5 (p less than 0.05). We conclude that infusion of ANF in hemodynamically effective doses in patients with heart failure decreases coronary vascular resistance with no change in coronary blood flow or myocardial oxygen or lactate metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the significance of technetium-99m pyrophosphate/thallium-201 scintigraphic overlap as an indicator of identifying early coronary reperfusion (less than or equal to 3 hours), 32 patients, in whom coronary recanalization was attempted for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), underwent myocardial imaging 3 days after the onset of AMI. The imaging was performed by simultaneous dual emission computed tomography, which allows simultaneous recording of technetium-99m pyrophosphate and thallium-201 images and comparison between both images in the same slice. The patients were separated into 3 groups: 9 patients in whom reperfusion was successful and showed scintigraphic overlap (group A), 12 with successful recanalization but no overlap (group B) and 11 with neither coronary reflow nor overlap (group C). No patient in whom reperfusion failed showed scintigraphic overlap (p less than 0.05). Groups A and B were comparable in age, infarct vessel, collateral circulation, residual coronary stenosis and cumulative release of creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme. However, compared with group B, group A had a shorter interval between onset of AMi and reflow (2.5 +/- 0.8 vs 4.8 +/- 1.3 hours, p less than 0.001). The presence of scintigraphic overlap identified early coronary reflow with a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 91%, positive predictive accuracy of 89% and negative predictive accuracy of 83%. Thus, technetium-99m/thallium-201 overlap on dual emission computed tomography can be used as an index of documenting early recanalization and might reflect the presence of salvaged myocardium adjacent to the necrotic tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and arginine vasopressin were studied in 5 patients during and after a 30-minute period of induced supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Immediately after the induction of SVT, plasma ANP levels began to increase, peaked at 32 minutes (+734% increase on average) and then gradually decreased. The mean plasma arginine vasopressin levels decreased during SVT, but the differences were not significant. When plasma ANP levels during SVT were compared with the simultaneously measured hemodynamic variables, a significant positive correlation (r = 0.73, p less than 0.001) was observed between plasma ANP levels and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Induced SVT was associated with increased urinary sodium and potassium excretion, increased urine flow and increased free water clearance. Concomitantly, glomerular filtration rate significantly increased (+77%) with an increase in filtration fraction. Although no significant change was observed in plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone concentrations decreased during and after SVT. These results suggest that increased left atrial pressure stimulates ANP release during SVT and that increased glomerular filtration rate and decreased aldosterone secretion by ANP, in addition to the inhibition of water reabsorption by decreased arginine vasopressin, may be responsible for natriuresis and diuresis associated with SVT.\r"

Their mean dietary Zn intake was 3.7 mg/d and mean caloric intake greater than 150 kcal.kg-1.d-1; one group received a daily Zn supplement of 50 mg for 2 wk. During the first week, weight gain was similar in the two groups, but during the second week, weight gain was 73% more in the Zn-supplemented group (8.83 +/- 1.56 vs 5.09 +/- 1.62 g.kg-1.d-1). The 95% confidence limits were 0.88 less to 8.36 g.kg-1.d-1 more gain in children receiving Zn supplements. The results strongly suggest that Zn supplements are beneficial to severely malnourished children during nutritional rehabilitation. Polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell Zn increased in the group receiving Zn supplements (p less than 0.001), confirming that the Zn content of PMN cells reflects available Zn.\r"

One hundred forty one patients were included in the study: 70 were treated with N and 71 with R. During the study, three patients were withdrawn for unwanted effects not related to the treatment, and therefore, 69 patients per group were studied. After 4 wk of treatment, 58 patients treated with N (84.1%) and 55 in the group treated with R (77.5%), showed complete endoscopic ulcer healing (p greater than 0.5). The corresponding figure after 8 wk of therapy was 64 (94.2%) and 65 (94.2%) (p greater than 0.5). A similar effect on pain relief was observed: 42% of patients in both groups became asymptomatic after 4 wk. After 8 wk, the percentage rose to 84.2% in the group treated with N and 87.0% in the R group (p greater than 0.5). In both groups, only minor side effects occurred, not requiring drug discontinuation. These data show that nizatidine in a single bedtime dose of 300 mg is as effective and safe as ranitidine at the same dosage, and represents therefore a valid alternative to the usual H2-antagonists.\r"

The purpose of this project was to study resource use, age, and outcome for nephrology admissions to a large academic medical center. Total hospital costs for the 784 nephrology admissions (January 1, 1985 to December 31, 1986) were $5,037,460. Mean hospital cost per patient and mortality generally increased with age. DRG payment for patients in the 13 nephrology DRGs analyzed would have produced an aggregate loss of $483,584; however, all age categories of patients 55 years of age and over generated significant losses (the highest was for patients 85 years and above, $5,343 loss per patient). Diabetic nephrology patients generated greater resource consumption compared with nondiabetic nephrology patients, as well as patients in medical and surgical DRGs with chronic renal failure compared with patients in these same DRGs without chronic renal failure. Older nephrology patients also demonstrated higher emergency and ICU admission and blood requirements than younger patients. This study suggests that the current DRG reimbursement scheme may be inequitable vis a vis older nephrology patients, as well as those with diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure. Financial disincentives by DRGs may affect both the access and quality of care for groups of nephrology patients in the future.\r"

Am J Med 1988; 84: 377-383), no significant differences in cardiopulmonary and gas exchange responses to acute, strenuous exercise were observed between volunteers with sickle cell trait (SCT) and control subjects at an altitude of 1,270 meters. The current study was designed to evaluate the effect of a greater hypoxic stimulus on the response of healthy, black male basic recruits, 11 with SCT (HbAS) and 11 control subjects, to acute strenuous exercise. Simulated 2,300-meter and simulated sea-level conditions were achieved by adjustment of the fraction of inspired oxygen (simulated condition of 2,300 meters equal to 18 percent; simulated sea-level condition equal to 24 percent) at the same barometric pressure (656 mm Hg). For each simulated condition, the subjects performed an incremental exercise test to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer. One steady-state exercise test with radial arterial access for arterial blood gases was performed under each condition on Day 2. Peak incremental exercise values for oxygen consumption (2.9 versus 2.81 liters/minute), heart rate (189 versus 187 beats/minute), oxygen pulse (15.4 versus 15.1 ml/beat), and anaerobic threshold (1.59 versus 1.62 liters/minute), at the simulated 2,300-meter height revealed no significant differences between men with SCT and control subjects, respectively. A 5 to 9 percent decrement in exercise performance at the simulated 2,300-meter level compared with exercise performance at the simulated sea-level condition was noted for both groups. Steady-state exercise values for arterial oxygen tension (64 versus 65 mm Hg), arterial oxygen saturation (90 versus 90 percent), alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure difference (22 versus 21 mm Hg), and physiologic dead space to tidal volume ratio (12 versus 11) at the simulated condition of 2,300 meters were similar for the SCT and control groups, respectively. It is concluded that in a moderate hypoxic environment, the cardiopulmonary and gas exchange responses of persons with SCT during brief episodes of exhaustive exercise were comparable to those of control subjects.\r"

In this study, hospital charges were contrasted with the health status at 1 year of follow-up of 549 patients admitted to a university hospital medical service. The findings related to short-term outcomes were consistent with those of other investigators: large expenditures were associated with patients who died in the hospital, especially those whose death was unexpected. Both 1-year survival and hospital charges were found to correlate with physician estimates of illness severity and prognosis at the time of admission. Patients considered not ill with a favorable prognosis had a mortality rate at 1 year of 3%, comprised 7% of the cohort and generated 2% of total charges. In contrast, patients considered severely ill with an unfavorable prognosis had a mortality rate of 65%, comprised 19% of the cohort and generated 30% of total charges. Nevertheless, 46% of the survivors in this latter group were considered to be functional and only mildly ill at 1 year of follow-up. The imprecision of clinical judgements at the time of admission in predicting long-term outcome argues for aggressive management of acutely hospitalized patients when there is any doubt about their prognosis.\r"

All were not progestin related. Other effects, however, were apparently dependent on the type of progestin, with the androgenically potent agent dl-norgestrel causing dramatic increases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and the ratio of low-density to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreases in HDL, particularly HDL2, and apoprotein Al. Reductions in HDL2 and increases in the LDL/HDL ratio are strongly associated with the development of atherosclerosis. In a study of postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy, estrogen alone was compared with estrogen plus dl-norgestrel. In contrast to the findings of the previous study, norgestrel lowered LDL and produced less substantial decreases in HDL and HDL2. Thus, although an antiestrogenic effect was evident, it cannot be assumed that the changes associated with progestin-containing oral contraceptives will automatically occur when lower doses of progestin are used in hormone replacement therapy.\r"

Cefotetan was more cost-effective than cefoxitin, even though cefoxitin was given for shorter periods. Cefotetan was also more cost-effective than a combination of ampicillin, an aminoglycoside, and clindamycin. Although the ampicillin, aminoglycoside, and metronidazole combination appeared to be the most cost-effective regimen, this combination required the longest administration time (240 percent longer than cefotetan). Cefotetan appears to be comparably efficacious and more cost-effective than other currently used antianaerobic regimens in our institution.\r"

Although we do not suggest the abolishment of all preoperative and postoperative medical evaluations, we do recommend the much more selective use of this valuable resource. Our data suggest that significant improvement in efficiency for many hospitals may be possible by omitting routine preoperative and postoperative medical evaluation for certain patients and by obtaining medical evaluation only in selected medium and higher risk surgical patients (ASA class 3 and above).\r"

  ".W": "The multicentric occurrence of tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract has been well described, with an incidence ranging from 5 to 16 percent. Detection of a synchronous primary tumor at the time of initial work-up is crucial both for management and final outcome. However, there is a diversity of opinions regarding the extent of the work-up to search for a second primary tumor. Some investigators consider routine panendoscopy to be essential for every patient with a head and neck primary tumor. Routine esophagoscopy and bronchoscopy with bronchial washings in the absence of specific symptoms appear to have minimal benefit and high cost. In our study of 140 consecutive patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck seen over a period of 3 years, detailed history, thorough head and neck examination, routine chest radiograph, and barium swallow when indicated were sufficient to identify 18 patients (13 percent) with a second primary tumor in the upper aerodigestive tract. The synchronous tumors of eight patients were in the head and neck area, seven patients had carcinoma of the lung, and three patients had a second primary in the esophagus. Two patients had three synchronous primaries. Follow-up of these patients ranged from 1 to 4 years. Panendoscopy with cytologic washings was performed routinely. We questioned the cost-effectiveness of routine triscopy in every patient with head and neck cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-six adult patients with the pathologic diagnosis of desmoid tumor were treated between 1964 and 1983 at the Institut Curie in Paris with megavoltage irradiation. Twenty of these patients (76 percent) had extraabdominal tumors. Definitive surgical resection was performed on nine patients (one received preoperative radiotherapy). At last follow-up 1 1/2 to 10 years after treatment, all of the patients had no evidence of disease. Seven of the nine had follow-up examinations from 5 to 10 years after treatment. Seven patients had postoperative radiotherapy with doses from 4,700 to 6,500 rads (47 to 65 Gy) for either microscopic (three patients) or gross (four patients) residual disease. All but one patient had no evidence of disease from 2 to 8 years after treatment. Nine patients had radiotherapy for recurrent inoperable tumors and six had no evidence of disease from 3 to 20 years after treatment. Recurrences developed in three patients; outside the treatment portal in one, and the other two had received less than 5,000 rads (50 Gy). Clinical regression of tumors after treatment was slow, with complete regression taking up to 2 years. Postoperative radiotherapy with doses of at least 5,000 to 6,000 rads (50 to 60 Gy) was effective in achieving local control of inoperable or incompletely resected tumors, thus the need for repeated resections was avoided. Computerized tomography has greatly improved the assessment of tumor extension and should be used routinely before either operation or radiotherapy to obtain adequate margins and minimize the chance of missing disease.\r"

The normal peritoneal microvasculature of the cremaster muscle of rats, with the nerve and blood supply intact, was visualized before and after exposure of the tissue to human malignant ascites fluid and to human plasma. In vivo fluorescent microscopy was used to quantitate leakage of fluorescent-tagged albumin. Exposure of the abluminal side of the vasculature to malignant ascitic fluid and plasma causes significant protein leakage from the small veins to the interstitial space. This suggests that the continued production of malignant ascites may be caused by a positive feedback system, which is related to factors present in a normal plasma filtrate. These factors can induce leakage of protein by an effect on the abluminal side of the normal peritoneal microvasculature.\r"

  ".W": "Long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) lines of mice were selectively bred for differences in CNS sensitivity to ethanol with LS mice exhibiting much greater sensitivity to hypnotic doses of ethanol (4.0-4.5 g/kg) than SS mice. The influence of peripheral and central catecholamine neuronal systems on ethanol sensitivity (sleep time) in LS and SS mice was examined following administration of reserpine, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine and 6-hydroxydopamine. Ten days after a single dose of reserpine, tyrosine hydroxylase activity was increased in the brain and adrenal gland of LS mice but only in the brain of SS mice relative to untreated mice. Brain catecholamine levels in the reserpine-treated mice were 25-50% lower in both LS and SS mice compared to levels in untreated mice. These changes were associated with a 41% reduction in LS sleep time, but a 90% increase in SS sleep time. SS mice were also more susceptible to the lethal effects of reserpine. The increased mortality of SS mice may relate to a greater degree of reserpine-induced hypothermia and a slower rate of recovery of brain catecholamine levels. Neonatal LS and SS mice treated with 6-hydroxydopamine exhibited increased levels of catecholamines in the locus ceruleus, decreased levels in the cerebellum and unchanged levels in the hypothalamus at 60 days of age. These changes were associated with a modest decrease (10%) in LS sleep time and a marked increase (200%) in SS sleep time. alpha-Methyl-p-tyrosine decreased brain catecholamine levels of both lines by 30-50% while LS sleep times were unchanged and SS sleep times were increased by 45%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This treatment had previously been shown by electron microscopy to result in myofibril loss and mitochondrial abnormalities. Ethanol was administered to pregnant mice by a liquid diet paradigm and pair-fed dams were used as controls. Ethanol exposure in utero reduced the activities of two mitochondrial inner membrane enzymes, cytochrome c oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase, in the hearts of perinatal mice. Secondly, mitochondrial respiration under both State 3 and 4 conditions with a NAD-linked substrate was depressed in the hearts obtained from the ethanol-exposed fetal mice. However, when a flavin-linked substrate was used, State 3 (ADP-stimulated) but not State 4 respiration was depressed. This study illustrates that in utero exposure to ethanol is deleterious to the functioning of cardiac mitochondria in newborn mice, which in turn could contribute to the development of the heart pathologies present in the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.\r"

The control group (n = 20) was monitored in an identical fashion, but the video monitor screen was turned off during the operation. The methohexital maintenance requirement was nonsignificantly decreased (5.0 +/- 1.2 vs 5.6 +/- 1.8 mg/min) in the experimental group. Adequacy of anesthesia (as determined by cardiorespiratory stability and the absence of purposeful movement during the maintenance period) did not differ between the two study groups. Although the awakening time for the experimental group (2.9 +/- 1.9 minutes) was decreased to a statistically significant degree compared to the control group (4.5 +/- 3.0 minutes), the difference was of no clinical significance. Thus, continuous electromyographic and EEG monitoring with the Datex ABM device did not significantly improve administration of methohexital during brief outpatient procedures.\r"

  ".U": "88239066\r", 
  ".W": "The anesthesiologist attempts to balance the dose or concentration of an anesthetic against the intensity of noxious stimulation so as to: 1) maintain a satisfactory anesthetic state, 2) minimize side effects and toxicity of the anesthetic, and 3) allow for a rapid recovery from anesthesia. The development of infusion pumps controlled by computers programmed according to pharmacokinetic principles should facilitate the achievement of these objectives for intravenous drugs. To test this hypothesis, the authors compared anesthetic conditions achieved with a computer-controlled infusion to those produced by the traditional method of intermittent intravenous injections. In both cases, the intravenous opiate, alfentanil, was used to supplement nitrous oxide anesthesia, and the dose/dose-rate of alfentanil after the induction dose was guided by the use of precisely defined clinical signs of inadequate anesthesia. One group of ten patients received 10 mg of alfentanil and 66% N2O to induce anesthesia, and was subsequently given 1 or 2 mg iv doses of alfentanil whenever the depth of anesthesia was inadequate. A second group of ten patients had a target alfentanil concentration of 475 ng/ml of plasma established by the computer-controlled infusion, which subsequently raised or lowered the concentration by 50 or 100 ng/ml according to the presence or absence of clinical signs of inadequate anesthesia. Regular measurements of alfentanil concentrations in plasma showed that the computer-assisted infusion produced relatively stable concentrations that closely paralleled those predicted (prediction error of -64 +/- 40 ng/ml [+/- SD] in the range of 150-600 ng/ml). The traditional method of intermittent injections resulted in continuous, rapid fluctuations in alfentanil concentrations. Both methods were successful in controlling the patients' responses to noxious stimuli, but the infusion group had: 1) a lower incidence of responsiveness, 2) greater hemodynamic stability, 3) no patients requiring naloxone for satisfactory ventilation postoperatively, and 4) an incidence of side effects that tended to be lower. The previously reported alfentanil concentration versus anesthetic effect relationships were confirmed.\r"

To evaluate this contention, we compared mannitol with normal saline administration in a canine model combining elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and hemorrhagic shock. Mongrel dogs were bled to and maintained at a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mm Hg for 30 minutes. Following this, ICP was elevated to and sustained at 25 mm Hg for 45 minutes by inflating an epidural balloon. The dogs were then randomized to resuscitation with 2 g/kg of mannitol in saline (total volume, 20 mL/kg; n = 5) or 20 mL/kg of normal saline alone (n = 5). All dogs were successfully resuscitated, and MAP returned to baseline levels in both groups. ICP was significantly lower and urine output significantly higher in the mannitol group than in saline controls (P less than .01). Moreover, cerebral perfusion pressure, cardiac index, and left ventricular stroke work index were significantly improved in dogs given mannitol versus controls during the first hour of resuscitation (P less than .05). Mannitol ameliorates increases in ICP without compromising hemodynamic resuscitation in a canine model of concomitant increased ICP and shock.\r"

To date, however, there are no conclusive tests that demonstrate that pulsed operation of the CO2 laser has clear advantages over continuous operation. This study compares the effects of a pulsed laser and a continuous laser on freshly removed human palatine tonsils and skeletal muscle tissue. The depth of thermal tissue damage was measured microscopically. It was observed that the depth of damage at the edge of the cut tissue decreased with increasing power density with both the pulsed laser and the continuous laser. With comparable power densities, however, pulsed operation unexpectedly produced somewhat deeper damage at the edge of the cut than did the continuous operation. The results obtained indicate that the pulsed CO2 lasers available today have no advantages over the continuous mode CO2 lasers for otolaryngologic surgical applications.\r"

Similar polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora were recovered from the cores of the tonsils in each group. beta-Lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) were recovered more often in the group with GABHS. This difference was due mostly to the lower incidence of beta-lactamase-producing strains of Branhamella catarrhalis and Bacteroides sp in hypertrophic tonsils following non-GABHS tonsillitis. beta-Lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus was found with equal frequency in both groups. These findings demonstrate that although BLPB are recovered more often in recurrently inflamed tonsils following GABHS infection, BLPB also can be found in hypertrophic tonsils following non-GABHS tonsillitis.\r"

The rotenone-sensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity was extremely decreased, ranging from 0% to 27% of the control value. In all patients, the content of subunits of Complex I was also reduced in parallel with the rotenone-sensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity.

The concentration of piritrexim needed to inhibit 50% of the catalytic activity of P. carinii dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) was 19.3 nM, and that for T. gondii DHFR was 17.0 nM, concentrations that were 40- to over 1,000-fold less than those needed for the inhibition of activity by trimethoprim and pyrimethamine, the antifolates conventionally used in treating these organisms. Piritrexim was able to inhibit replication of T. gondii in a mouse peritoneal macrophage model at concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 microM. Leucovorin, a reduced folate that can bypass the inhibition of DHFR by antifols in mammalian cells but not in protozoa, did not affect the ability of piritrexim to inhibit T. gondii replication. The addition of sulfadiazine, which alone was ineffective, to piritrexim allowed inhibition of T. gondii replication at lower concentrations of piritrexim than when piritrexim was used alone. These results suggest that piritrexim, alone or combined with a sulfonamide, may be a highly potent antitoxoplasma and antipneumocystis agent that could provide major pharmacologic and clinical advantages over available agents.\r"

  ".U": "88239569\r", 
  ".W": "The uptake of quinolone antibiotics by Escherichia coli was investigated by using fleroxacin (RO 23-6240, AM 833) as a prototype compound. The uptake of fleroxacin was reduced and its MIC was increased in the presence of magnesium. Quinolones induced lipopolysaccharide release, increased cell-surface hydrophobicity and outer membrane permeability to B-lactams, and sensitized cells to lysis by detergents. These effects were also antagonized by magnesium and were very similar to those seen with EDTA and gentamicin. MICs of quinolones in portin-deficient strains were increased relative to those of the parent strain, consistent with a porin pathway of entry. However, MICs were further increased in the presence of magnesium; the size of the additional increase showed a positive correlation with quinolone hydrophobicity in an OmpF- OmpC- OmpA- strain. When quinolones were mixed with divalent cations in solution, changes in quinolone fluorescence suggestive of metal chelation were observed. The addition of fleroxacin to a cell suspension resulted in a rapid initial association of fluorescence with cells, followed by a brief decrease and a final time-dependent linear increase in cell-associated fluorescence. We interpret these results as representing chelation of outer membrane-bound magnesium by fleroxacin and other quinolones, dissociation of the quinolone-magnesium complex from the outer membrane, and diffusion of the quinolone through both porins and exposed lipid domains on the outer membrane. For a given quinolone, the contribution of the porin and nonporin pathways to total uptake is influenced by the hydrophobicity of the quinolone.\r"

Binding to sodium alginate was similar to binding to exopolysaccharide, both in the dependence on tobramycin concentration and in the maximum binding observed at saturation. Incorporation of sodium alginate into agar plates reduced the zone sizes of growth inhibition caused by tobramycin. The reductions in zone sizes were quantitatively accounted for by the binding of tobramycin to sodium alginate during diffusion of the antibiotic away from the well in which it had been placed at the start of the experiment. However, the binding of tobramycin to the exopolysaccharide of P. aeruginosa, and the resulting inhibition of diffusion of the antibiotic, did not significantly increase the penetration time of a spherical microcolony with a radius of 125 micron, such as might be found in the respiratory tract of a patient with cystic fibrosis (from a 90% penetration time of 12 s in the absence of exopolysaccharide to one of 35 s with an exopolysaccharide concentration of 1.0% [wt/vol]).\r"

The mutants were 8- to 64-fold more resistant to ciprofloxacin and showed complete cross resistance to nalidixic acid, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin. Two chromosomal resistance genes, cfxA and cfxB, were mapped between eda-9001 and phe-2 and near pyrB52 distal to proC130, respectively. The cfxB mutation was identical to a nalB mutation and conferred cross resistance to novobiocin, tetracycline, carbenicillin, and chloramphenicol, suggesting that there is an effect on permeability. DNA gyrase A and B subunits were purified from strain PAO2 (wild type), PAO236 nalA2, PAO4704 cfxA2, and PAO4700 cfxA1 cfxB1. Inhibition of gyrase-mediated DNA supercoiling by ciprofloxacin or nalidixic acid was greatly reduced in preparations derived from each of the mutants. Inhibition studies on reconstituted heterologous gyrase subunits showed that decreased inhibition was dependent on the mutant gyrase A subunit. We conclude that ciprofloxacin resistance in P. aeruginosa PAO2 can occur by mutation in the nalB gene or the gene for DNA gyrase A (formerly nalA).\r"

The rationale for such a test was (i) to set up in vitro conditions as close as possible to those the antibiotics encounter in serious infections and (ii) to hold the drugs capable of almost completely killing the bacteria used in the assay to be highly active in vitro and likely to be the most efficacious in the treatment of serious infections. Among the antibiotics used, ceftriaxone proved to be highly active under conditions simulating pulmonary infections and septicemias caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (bacteria grown in bronchoalveolar fluid or blood; antibiotic concentrations varying with time as in human bronchial secretions or blood) and under conditions simulating blood and urinary infections caused by Escherichia coli (bacteria grown in human blood or urine; antibiotic concentrations varying as in the various fluids). Gentamicin (not tested against pneumococci) appeared to be highly active only under conditions simulating urinary infections caused by E. coli; aztreonam (not tested against pneumococci) and ampicillin (tested only against pneumococci) did not appear to be highly active under any of the test conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Radon daughters were counted by gamma spectroscopy from 180 adult residents of eastern Pennsylvania. A seven-position, 35-min scan was conducted in a mobile body counter, generally during afternoon or evening hours. Track-etch detectors for household radon were distributed, and were recovered from 80% of the subjects. Over 75% of the population had environmentally enhanced radon daughter contamination. House radon levels were strongly related, as anticipated, to radon daughter contamination in the 112 subjects for whom both sets of measurements were available (p less than .001); basement measurements were as strongly related to personal contamination as were living area measurements; bedroom measurements were slightly more strongly correlated. Both sex (p less than .02) and cigarette smoking (p less than .01) significantly modified the relationships, after nonlinear adjustment for travel times. Using a logarithmic model, a given house living-area radon level was associated in females with body contamination by radon daughters 2-3 times that in males. Nonsmokers had 2-4 times higher levels of contamination than smokers. Results are for the total of internal and external contamination, these being highly correlated in preliminary experiments. Time usage and activity patterns of the subjects are believed to be important in explaining these findings, and may become important variables in radon risk assessment.\r"

In the past 5 years, it has been demonstrated that the gut, long known to have significant morphologic changes with protein calorie malnutrition (PCM), is an immune organ affected by malnutrition. To assess the role of biliary immunoglobulin A (S-IgA), part of the barrier to bacterial invasion from the gastrointestinal tract, the following study was performed. Seventy-eight Fisher female inbred rats weighing 110-130 g were randomly separated into two groups. The control rats were fed standard rat chow. The experimental rats were fed a 2% agar protein depletion (PCM) diet (USP XV). The biliary tract of the rat was cannulated with Silastic tubing and bile flow and rat secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) was sampled at intervals. S-IgA was measured by the Elisa method. Total bile protein was measured by micro-Kjeldahl. Bile was collected from the rats on day 0, 7, 14, 21, 29, 36, 42, and 49. During the study, the weight of rats fed the PCM diet decreased from 127.4 +/- 14.5 g at day 0 to 83 +/- 2.6 g on day 37. Control rats gained weight from 124.4 +/- 14.5 g at day 0 to 153.6 +/- 3.8 g at day 37. Total biliary protein at day 0 was 2.52 +/- .05 mg/ml and at day 36 was 2.51 +/- 11 mg/ml for PCM rats and 2.57 +/- 10 mg/ml for control rats. Normal rats and control rats both had an initial increase of S-IgA from 2.74 +/- 73 mg/ml on day 0 to 5.75 +/- 1.75 mg/ml on day 37. Both PCM and control rats demonstrated an increase in S-IgA levels despite significant loss of weight in the experimental group. Similarly, total biliary protein was not decreased in either group. The results suggest that gut immune system is preserved despite significant protein calorie malnutrition.\r"

Patient characteristics, reason for NHCU admission, and patients' final disposition were determined and compared with those of consecutive patients admitted to the same facility during an identical time period in 1983 (pre-DRGs). More than seven times as many patients were admitted in 1986, and prior to NHCU admission the acute care hospital stay was significantly shorter in 1986 (22 vs 60 days). Whereas in 1983, most patients (94%) were admitted to the NHCU for long-term care placement, in 1986, the majority of patients (64%) were admitted for continuation of therapy started in the acute care hospital. In 1983 only two patients (9%) required hospital readmission within ten days of NHCU admission, compared with 22 (22%) of the patients in 1986. At the termination of the study period, none of the 31 patients admitted to the NHCU in 1983 had been discharged; in comparison, 33% of the patients in 1986 were discharged home. We conclude that in 1986 certain nursing homes drastically changed their role in the delivery of medical care, and are now functioning as extensions of acute care hospitals. Such a role is advantageous in allowing patients to be quickly discharged from the acute care hospital; however, the changing role presents new problems and challenges.\r"

Heparin therapy was effective in five patients (50%), while treatment with gabexate was successful in seven patients (70%). Although the therapeutic efficacy of gabexate was not significantly different from that of heparin, in patients in whom bleeding tendencies were observed at the start of the therapy, the former was successful in four (80%) of five patients, while the latter was effective in only one (25%) of four patients treated. The results of this preliminary and nonrandomized study suggest that gabexate is as effective as heparin for the treatment of DIC, and that it may be more successful than heparin in the treatment of DIC accompanied by bleeding diathesis.\r"

The patients showed a comparatively reduced anteroposterior (AP) gradient for CBF. Though there were no differences in frontal flow, the patients had higher flow to several postcentral brain regions, bilaterally. Cerebral blood flow in the patients correlated inversely with age and positively with carbon dioxide level. Women had higher flow than men. Duration of the illness was the only significant predictor of the reduced AP gradient in patients. Higher left temporal and right parietal flow were found to be the best discriminators between patients and controls. Mean hemispheric flow to both hemispheres and several brain regions correlated with the total score and the item, unusual thought content, of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. There were no differences in regional CBF between medicated and unmedicated patients.\r"

Our objectives were to determine if elevated levels of soluble IL-2R occur in patients with active ML, whether serum IL-2R levels are prognostic, and whether prospective studies are warranted. Our preliminary data indicate that serum IL-2R levels correlate with disease activity and size of tumor, but not with grade or stage of the tumor. Five-year actuarial survival was 20% for patients with IL-2R levels greater than 1000 U/mL at any time during their course and 86% for patients who did not exceed that threshold. Furthermore, patients with IL-2R levels lower than 1000 U/mL were more likely to achieve a complete remission. Serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid levels did not show significant correlation with disease activity or prognosis. We conclude that serum IL-2R levels may have clinical and prognostic significance in patients with ML and that prospective studies are indicated.\r"

An instrument containing over 700 questions relating to the patient's ability to engage in productive and self-sufficient living skills was developed after consultation with numerous programs, professionals, families, and patients. Results indicated a broad spectrum of deficits and needs in survivors. No one course of recovery was noted for individual survivors, and residual deficits were noted for at least some portion of the surveyed population across every topic that was covered. Most survivors lived with their families, did not work or attend school, and were dependent upon others for skills, finances, and services outside the home. Due to a lack of available programs, families most frequently assumed the major responsibility for the survivor's long-term care despite no training in this area. Most families reported that the traumatic episode continued to have a variety of adverse effects on the family years after the injury.\r"

Over a 2-month period the patient completely recovered from this nearly always fatal gastrointestinal complication of polyarteritis nodosa. The medical, surgical, and radiographic approach we used may be applicable to the management of similar cases in the future.\r"

In a second group of seven dogs, HPV responses with nicardipine were assessed during constant cardiac output controlled by inflation of a balloon placed in the inferior vena cava, as higher doses of nicardipine significantly increased cardiac output. In the group with uncontrolled cardiac output, selective ventilation of the left lower lobe lung (LLL) with 100% nitrogen caused a significant decrease in blood flow to the lobe (QLLL/Qt) to 47.8 +/- 5.5% and an increase in vascular resistance of the LLL (PVRLLL) from 6018 +/- 884 to 13807 +/- 1162 dyn s cm-5. Testing hypoxic responses during infusion of nicardipine 1, 3 and 6 micrograms kg-1 min-1 showed a dose-dependent depression of HPV response. Infusions of nicardipine 3 and 6 micrograms kg-1 min-1 with LLL hypoxia resulted in a slight decrease in lobar blood flow, and a hypoxia-induced increase in PVRLLL was not statistically significant. In the controlled cardiac output group, attenuation of HPV responses by nicardipine was similar to that in the uncontrolled cardiac output group.\r"

The two bolus injections of diltiazem resulted in plasma concentrations of 688 +/- 115 and 650 +/- 85 ng ml-1 (means +/- SE), respectively, and caused substantial decreases in systemic and coronary vascular resistances, and in aortic pressure, and increases in LV segment shortening, stroke volume and aortic flow. Electrophysiological variables were little affected. At the low infusion rate (plasma concentration 140 +/- 23 ng ml-1) coronary and systemic vasodilatation occurred, but global and regional RV and LV performance were little affected. PR interval increased by 15%. At the higher infusion rate (plasma concentration 282 +/- 33 ng ml-1) coronary and systemic vasodilatation were maintained. Aortic pressure decreased slightly. Whereas LV end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions remained unchanged, they increased in the RV. In addition, the PR interval increased by 35%, and three animals developed atrioventricular block type I. The data indicate that diltiazem is a potent coronary and systemic vasodilator with little effect on global RV and LV performance. However, at a higher infusion rate RV dimensions clearly tend to increase, and conduction abnormalities develop.\r"

Differences in the 90% response time of the individual electrodes were more marked in vitro than in vivo. Changes in end-tidal gas tensions were reflected by proportionate changes in transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide (PtcO2 and PtcCO2) but, in the individual subject, PtcO2 and PtcCO2 were generally poor indicators of the end-tidal values. During steady-state recordings, the PtcO2 signal drifted upwards by more than 12 mm Hg during 140 min in vivo recording in all three electrodes, without changes in either PtcCO2 or end-tidal values. The dual electrodes tested provide non-invasive estimates of qualitative, but not quantitative, change in blood-gas tensions and are likely to have only a limited role to play in adult anaesthetic practice.\r"

Dithranol treatment caused an increase in plasma 5-S-CD in some psoriatic patients, suggesting a possible association between skin erythema and elevated 5-S-CD levels. The value of plasma 5-S-CD in the follow-up of patients with malignant melanoma does not seem to be invalidated by unavoidable exposure of the subjects to sunlight in a temperate climate such as that of South East Scotland.\r"

A careful distinction was made between chronic open angle glaucoma (COAG), acute and chronic angle closure glaucoma, ocular hypertension, low tension glaucoma, patients with large cup disc ratios, and various types of secondary glaucoma including pseudoexfoliation of the lens capsule, uveitic and traumatic glaucoma. Using ABO blood groups, Rhesus groups, ABH secretion or non-secretion, and phenylthiourea tasting we identified certain differences. The differences from normal were significant decrease in Rh-negative patients in chronic closed angle glaucoma (p less than 0.05), a decrease in ABH secretors in ocular hypertension (p less than 0.01), and fewer HB secretors in patients with COAG (p less than 0.02). There was a significant decrease in AH secretors and increase in HB secretors in both pseudoexfoliation with raised intraocular pressure compared with COAG (p less than 0.01) and in secondary glaucomas as a group compared with COAG (p less than 0.01). Tasters of phenylthiourea were more common in traumatic and uveitic glaucoma than in normal controls (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that secondary glaucoma develops in different subjects from COAG, while patients who develop a rise in intraocular pressure proceed to cupping and field loss if they have a certain genetic constitution. The groups of patients are too small for the differences to be of great prognostic value.\r"

In 204 patients we found that, of the 38 subjects with pre-existing DISH, 29% developed postoperative ossification compared with only 10% in those without DISH (p less than 0.01). DISH is therefore a risk factor for postoperative ectopic bone formation. In a separate study of 1325 patients (not analysed for spinal DISH), we looked for correlations between the severity of postoperative ectopic bone and clinical measurements. Even for the more severe ossification grades (n = 112), only 10% reported serious pain and only 26% had reduced hip flexion (less than 70 degrees). Thus, periprosthetic ectopic bone is not sufficiently important to justify the routine use of preventative drugs such as bisphosphonates in patients with DISH undergoing total hip replacement.\r"

Renal biopsies were performed, and creatinine clearance and proteinuria were measured serially for 74 months (range 16-148 months). Fourteen patients developed proteinuria within six months after the start of treatment and 27 within 12 months. When treatment was stopped the proteinuria reached a median peak of 4.2 g/24 h (range 0.3-15.0 g/24 h) at one month (range 0-7 months) before resolving spontaneously by six months (12 patients), 12 months (21), or 18 months (29). In all patients but one, who developed carcinoma of the renal pelvis, proteinuria resolved by 21 months and its median duration was eight months. The median first and last measurements of creatinine clearance showed no appreciable change (80 ml/min and 78 ml/min), and no patient died from or needed treatment for renal failure. The HLA-B8 or HLA-DR3 alloantigen, or both, were identified in 10 patients. Renal biopsy specimens showed membranous glomerulonephritis in 29 patients, minimal change nephropathy in two, and electron dense deposits in the mesangial regions in two. In all the patients whose nephropathy was due solely to treatment with penicillamine the proteinuria resolved completely when the drug was withdrawn; renal function did not deteriorate, and corticosteroids were unnecessary.\r"

  ".U": "88241230\r", 
  ".W": "Several notifications of eye pain and blurred vision associated with treatment with nifedipine were received by New Zealand's Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme. A questionnaire survey of patients taking nifedipine was undertaken to test the importance of these associations, with disturbance of taste associated with captopril taken as a methodological control. Altogether 961 patients taking nifedipine and 368 taking captopril were sent a questionnaire that asked whether any eye problems and changes in the sense of taste had occurred while they were taking the drug and whether these had resolved after treatment was stopped. Compliance was high: of 922 and 343 questionnaires that were assumed to have been delivered to patients taking nifedipine and captopril, respectively, 770 (84%) and 295 (86%) were returned satisfactorily completed. The distribution of sex was comparable in the two groups; patients taking captopril were slightly younger. Eye symptoms were reported in both groups, but eye pain was significantly more common in patients taking nifedipine (107 (14%) compared with 26 (9%) patients taking captopril). This is a new finding and may be related to ocular vasodilatation. Theoretically, glaucoma is a possible adverse reaction. Loss of taste was significantly associated with captopril, but no other disturbances of taste showed significant associations. Loss of taste persisted in 27 out of 35 patients who continued to take captopril and in three out of eight patients when the drug was withdrawn. This study showed a method of assessing early signs of adverse drug reactions, which has been used once before and identified previously unrecognised reactions.\r"

  ".U": "88241231\r", 
  ".W": "About one third of patients receiving dialysis for end stage renal failure have chronic fluid overload despite advice to restrict their oral fluid intake. To investigate the potential of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in reducing the urge to drink and consequent gain in weight, a double blind, placebo controlled crossover trial of enalapril was conducted in 25 patients receiving dialysis who had fluid overload. The trial comprised a baseline period of four weeks; two periods of treatment, each of four weeks, during which patients received either placebo or enalapril 5 mg twice each week; and a follow up period of four weeks. Five patients withdrew from the trial, one because of an adverse drug reaction to enalapril. A range of biochemical and behavioural variables was measured during the baseline period, at the completion of periods 1 and 2, and during follow up. These variables included gain in weight between dialysis sessions; blood pressure; plasma concentrations of sodium, angiotensin II, and vasopressin; plasma renin and angiotensin converting enzyme activities; osmolality; and estimations of thirst, intake of fluid, and control of drinking. Enalapril caused a significant reduction in gain in weight between dialysis sessions, thirst, and oral intake of fluid in parallel with significantly increased renin activity, significantly decreased angiotensin converting enzyme activity, and decreased concentrations of angiotensin II. Gain in weight and angiotensin converting enzyme activity returned to baseline values once patients stopped taking enalapril. These results suggest that enalapril may act on the renin-angiotensin system and reduce intake of fluid by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme.\r"

A positive result was obtained in 170 (13%) subjects. Nineteen of the 153 subjects investigated were found to have colorectal carcinomas and 52 had polyps (40 with adenomas). Radial immunodiffusion and Hemoccult II with and without rehydration detected bleeding in, respectively, all 19, 15, and 11 subjects with colorectal carcinoma. Hemoccult II with and without rehydration detected only seven and six, respectively, of 11 Duke's stage A carcinomas, whereas all 11 were detected with the immunological test. Hemoccult II with and without rehydration and radial immunodiffusion detected bleeding from adenomas in, respectively, 22, 14, and 34 of the 40 subjects. False positive results occurred in 55 out of 1302 subjects by Hemoccult II with rehydration, in 28 out of 1304 by Hemoccult II without rehydration, and in 50 out of 1304 by the immunological technique; true positive results were defined as bleeding from carcinomas and adenomas. Immunological detection of occult blood in faecal samples seems to show more adenomas and carcinomas (particularly early lesions) than the Hemoccult II kit and has a rate of false positive results that is acceptably low.\r"

The number of open access fibresigmoidoscopies doubled during the five years but diagnostic yield remained unchanged at about 40% and was similar to that of the hospital initiated procedures. Colorectal carcinoma was seen in 64 open access patients compared with 47 hospital referred patients, the proportion of Dukes's type A lesions being similar (34%) in both groups. Polyps, colitis, and diverticular disease were equally common in open access and hospital referred patients. Fibresigmoidoscopy failed to detect disease in only 12 patients (1.2%) and the procedure was unsatisfactory in only 54. Referral was considered justified in 475 (88%) open access patients, and only 54 (17%) patients with normal appearances at endoscopy required further investigations. Diagnostic yields were low (19%; 30/156 cases) in open access patients under 40 and in patients with abdominal pain, constipation, or abdominal pain with constipation (0-17%). Most of these young patients presumably suffer from the irritable bowel syndrome and do not justify fibresigmoidoscopy. In contrast, there was a high diagnostic yield (90-100%) in patients of all ages referred for diarrhoea and rectal bleeding, altered blood from the rectum, and rectal bleeding associated with abdominal pain. Open access fibresigmoidoscopy is an effective service that should be freely available to general practitioners.\r"

None of the larger lesions of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (affecting more than two quadrants of the cervix) was associated with negative cytology. The false negative cytology rate for smaller lesions was 58%. The clinical importance of the smaller lesions that were not accurately detected by cytology screening is unknown. As these lesions affected 6% of the screened population further studies of their clinical course are urgently required. Local destructive treatment in such cases may represent considerable overtreatment. If these lesions prove to be clinically important, however, the results of this study predict an increasing epidemic of preinvasive and invasive disease of the cervix.\r"

The patients were divided into three treatment groups: one received a low fibre control diet throughout the study period of 20 weeks and the other received two supplements of cereal fibre and guar gum in a crossover manner. The nutrient content of the diets was kept constant throughout. Though patients taking the low fibre diet showed a smaller reduction in fasting plasma glucose concentrations over the first eight weeks than patients taking a high fibre diet, this difference was not evident at the end of 20 weeks; reductions in weight and glycated haemoglobin values were similar for each dietary regimen throughout the trial. There was little evidence that supplementing a low energy, high carbohydrate diet with fibre confers any therapeutic benefit to type II diabetics and no evidence that taking fibre as viscous polysaccharides is any more beneficial to overweight diabetics than taking a similar fibre supplement as cereal. On the contrary, guar gum caused more abdominal discomfort and flatulence than the other diets.\r"

Treatment with hormones significantly reversed the vertebral bone loss. The net gain in vertebral bone density amounted to 6.4% a year with continuous supplementation and 5.4% a year with sequential supplementation; the net gain in forearm bone density was lower (3.6% with continuous and 3.7% with sequential supplementation). Before a policy of supplementation with hormones can be recommended to all postmenopausal women with the aim of reducing the incidence of vertebral crush fractures further studies with different doses and combinations of hormones, administered over several years, are needed.\r"

To assess these needs 104 young people with physical handicaps were given a medical examination and interviewed. They had diverse physical handicaps, many of which were rare (41 subjects); 45 had cerebral palsy and 18 spina bifida. Mental handicap (42 subjects) and a need for special education (28) were also diagnosed. The state of health of all subjects was generally poor. Sixty one subjects had contractures of the lower joints and almost a quarter contractures of the upper joints; 26 had deformed feet. Consequently, many subjects (41) could not walk; only 13 could walk without difficulty. Urinary and bowel incontinence were prevalent (58 and 55 subjects, respectively) and with contractures and pressure sores resulted in skin problems (35 subjects). Kyphoscoliosis was present in 30 subjects, particularly those with spina bifida (10 out of 18), of whom one third had respiratory problems and almost half cardiac problems. Thirty one subjects had epilepsy. Many subjects (49) had difficulty communicating or some visual defect (27). Although over half the subjects had health problems that were severe enough to warrant intervention, less than a third were receiving any form of regular hospital care; regular contact with physiotherapists, speech therapists, and dentists was also poor. Moreover, the original diagnoses and prescriptions had not been reviewed regularly. Teams for handicapped adults should be set up in all district health authorities to provide a clinical and coordination service for all adults with physical and mental handicaps.\r"

  ".W": "The role of preceding infection as a risk factor for ischaemic stroke was investigated in a case-control study of 54 consecutive patients under 50 years of age with brain infarction and 54 randomly selected controls from the community matched for sex and age. Information about previous illnesses, smoking, consumption of alcohol, and use of drugs was taken. A blood sample was analysed for standard biochemical variables and serum cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and fasting blood glucose concentrations determined. Titres of antimicrobial antibodies against various bacteria, including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Yersinia, and Salmonella and several viruses were determined. Febrile infection was found in patients during the month before the brain infarction significantly more often than in controls one month before their examination (19 patients v three controls; estimated relative risk 9.0 (95% confidence interval 2.2 to 80.0)). The most common preceding febrile infection was respiratory infection (80%). Infections preceding brain infarction were mostly of bacterial origin based on cultural, serological, and clinical data. In conditional logistic regression analysis for matched pairs the effect of preceding febrile infection remained significant (estimated relative risk 14.5 (95% confidence interval 1.9 to 112.3)) when tested with triglyceride concentration, hypertension, smoking, and preceding intoxication with alcohol. Although causality cannot be inferred from these data and plausible underlying mechanisms remain undetermined, preceding febrile infection may play an important part in the development of brain infarction in young and middle aged patients.\r"

Vagal blockade caused significant bronchodilatation at 4 am and 4 pm (peak expiratory flow rate rose from 260 to 390 l/min at 4 am and 400 to 440 l/min at 4 pm) and significantly increased the pulse rate from 60 to 121 beats/minute at 4 am and from 76 to 122 beats/minute at 4 pm. Nocturnal asthma was almost totally reversed, implying that vagal mechanisms are fundamental in its pathophysiology. Other mechanisms--diurnal changes in plasma adrenaline concentration, the activity of non-adrenergic non-cholinergic nerves, and circadian rhythms of inflammatory mediator activity--may also be implicated.\r"

Of 71 alcohol-related deaths 30 were the drivers (or motorcyclists) themselves, nine were their passengers, 23 were pedestrians with raised blood alcohol concentrations, and nine were innocent victims. The high blood alcohol concentrations of the intoxicated drivers, passengers, and pedestrians, which may point to alcoholism, suggest that publicity campaigns will be of little value in reducing the number of deaths in road traffic accidents related to alcohol. The time at which these accidents occurred was related to licensing hours and this should be taken into account when considering changes in licensing laws.\r"

The humoral response was investigated in ankylosing spondylitis and other inflammatory disorders. IgA antibodies to klebsiella pneumoniae K43 were measured in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis and in controls. Significantly raised median titres of anti-klebsiella IgA, measured as optical density at 405 nm with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were seen among the patients with ankylosing spondylitis (0.7), Crohn's disease (0.8), rheumatoid arthritis (0.6), and ulcerative colitis (0.8) compared with controls (0.4). Activity of disease in ankylosing spondylitis and titres of anti-klebsiella IgA were not correlated. In contrast, titres of anti-klebsiella IgM were significantly lower in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and ulcerative colitis. The increase in the titres of anti-klebsiella IgA may be due to increased permeability of the gut to bacterial antigens, leading to an increased IgA response in the gut mucosa and permitting the release of IgA into the circulation. As the increased antibody titres were seen in Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis as well as in ankylosing spondylitis the response may be nonspecific, occurring because of possible underlying inflammatory bowel disease in these conditions.\r"

The long term prognosis of 50 patients from the Oxfordshire community stroke project, who did not receive anticoagulants, was compared with that of 70 similar patients from Maastricht, who were treated with anticoagulants. After a mean follow up of 27 months there was no significant difference in either the rate of survival or the rate of recurrent stroke between the two groups. These data suggest that any benefit of anticoagulation is modest. A large randomised trial is planned to establish whether long term anticoagulant treatment is of value and, if so, to what extent.\r"

Data on age, sex, respiratory illness, and social and environmental variables were obtained by questionnaire for 4815 children living in inner cities. The children were classified as white, Afro-Caribbean, Urdu, Gujarati, Punjabi, other Asian, or \"other.\" Significant differences in the prevalence of respiratory conditions were found among the ethnic groups after allowance was made for the effects of interfering variables. Except for asthma all conditions were most prevalent in Afro-Caribbeans and whites. In these two ethnic groups respiratory illness was significantly associated with belonging to a one parent family and the combined use of gas cookers and paraffin heaters at home. Respiratory illness was found to vary in prevalence among ethnic groups but may be perceived differently by different groups. Further studies, measuring lung function, are necessary.\r"

The patients' views of their relationship with their doctor after the computer was introduced were compared with their view of their relationship before the installation of the computer. More than 96% of the patients (n = 263) stated that contact with their doctor was as easy and as personal as before. Most stated that the computer did not influence the duration of the consultation. Eighty one patients (30%) stated, however, that they thought that their privacy was reduced. Unlike studies of patients' attitudes performed before any actual experience of use of a computer in general practice, this study found that patients have little difficulty in accepting the presence of a computer in the consultation room. Nevertheless, doctors should inform their patients about any connections between their computer and other, external computers to allay fears about a decrease in privacy.\r"

The parents' country of birth, whether they were employed, and their housing conditions were recorded using the definitions of the 1981 census. Four ethnic groups (British (183 children), Asian (127), Caribbean (61), and other (31)) were identified. Though attendance rates based on the populations of electoral wards at the census and standardised for distance from the hospital showed no significant differences among the ethnic groups, there was a strong gradient by social class and strong associations with unemployment of the mother (although not of the father), overcrowding, and tenure of housing. Social disadvantage seems to be more important than ethnicity as a determinant of accidents to children in the home.\r"

Nineteen healthy white men, aged 23 to 40 years, ingested 0.25 mg digoxin tablets every 12 hours for two consecutive periods of 2 weeks. Each subject also received one of the calcium channel blockers during one of these periods, with agent and sequence randomized. Analyst-blind RIA serum digoxin determinations demonstrated that the nine subjects who received isradipine, 5 mg t.i.d., had a small increment in peak digoxin level from 2.3 +/- 0.6 to 2.9 +/- 0.7 ng/ml (p less than 0.05) but no significant change in steady-state level or AUC over 12 hours. By contrast, the 10 subjects who received verapamil, 80 mg t.i.d., showed significant increases in steady-state (0.9 +/- 0.1 to 1.3 +/- 0.2 ng/ml; p less than 0.001) and peak serum digoxin concentrations (2.5 +/- 0.7 to 3.6 +/- 0.8 ng/ml; p less than 0.001) and in AUC (15.7 +/- 1.7 to 23.6 +/- 2.9 ng . hr/ml; p less than 0.001). Neither calcium channel blocker reduced renal digoxin clearance. Verapamil increases digoxin levels without affecting renal clearance. Isradipine has no clinically important interaction with digoxin.\r"

After intravenous administration the elimination half-life increased from 1.5 +/- 0.2 hours in normal volunteers to 6.9 +/- 3.3 hours in patients with renal failure. The plasma clearance decreased from 0.59 +/- 0.07 L/kg/hr in normal volunteers to 0.14 +/- 0.02 L/kg/hr in patients with renal failure. Nizatidine bioavailability was nearly 100% in normal volunteers but decreased to 75% in patients with renal failure. The volume of distribution was 1.3 +/- 0.1 L/kg in normal volunteers and was not different in patients with renal failure. Nizatidine protein binding was about 30% in normal and uremic plasma. The drug was not substantially removed by hemodialysis. Patients with creatinine clearances less than 50 ml/min/1.73 m2 should receive 150 mg nizatidine once each evening.

The study groups consisted of group 1, severe GH deficiency; group 2, partial GH deficiency; group 3, patients with prior cranial radiation for nonpituitary brain tumors; and group 4, children with idiopathic growth failure. Children in group 1 were unresponsive to GRF (mean GH peak +/- SEM, 1.6 +/- 0.5 ng/ml). Higher GH responses to GRF were observed in both groups 2 (17.2 +/- 4.1 ng/ml) and 3 (10.4 +/- 2.8 ng/ml). The highest GH responses to GRF were observed in group 4 (35.9 +/- 4.3 ng/ml). ANOVA revealed a significant difference between groups (F = 12.9; df = 3; p less than 0.01), and further analysis by the Scheffe and Student-Newman-Keuls tests revealed that group 4 was significantly higher than groups 1, 2, or 3 (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that GRF unresponsiveness is a reliable predictor of severe GH deficiency. In patients with partial GH deficiency or idiopathic growth failure, the GRF gives semiquantitative information about somatotrope responsivity to exogenous stimulation.\r"

One hundred courses of HPN were given to 89 patients for complications of Crohn's disease. Six registering centers provided 87 percent of the courses of treatment. The short-bowel syndrome was a factor in 60 patients, fistulas in 29 patients, and exacerbation of the disease in 41 patients. Thirty patients had more than one complication. The age distribution of patients with Crohn's disease was the same as for all HPN patients. Nine patients have died and eight have ceased HPN because of complications from the treatment. Fifty two percent of the patients had no complications. Patients with Crohn's disease on HPN had a significantly better lifestyle than the group as a whole (P less than .05) and had lower sepsis and complication rates (P less than .01 and 0.001, respectively). The 60 Crohn's patients with short-bowel syndrome spent a significantly longer time on HPN than Crohn's patients overall (P less than .05). Only 15 of these have been able to cease treatment and resume enteral feeding, compared with 23 of the other 40 patients who were able to resume enteral nutrition after a median of three months. Analysis of the authors' group of 35 patients included in the 100 showed that the only nutritional parameters of use in monitoring the patients' well-being were weight and serum albumin. Eighty percent of the patients with Crohn's disease who were treated by HPN have either successfully resumed enteral feeding or are successfully managing their own HPN. HPN is a safe and effective treatment for patients with acute or chronic intestinal failure from Crohn's disease.\r"

In experiment 1, TRH was peripherally administered (10 micrograms/kg) to rats subjected to cold-restraint stress and compared to an inactive peptide; in experiment 2, TRH was administered intracerebroventricularly (0.02, 0.1, and 0.5 microgram/kg) to rats with no adjunctive experimental stress; in experiment 3, TRH antiserum was given intracerebroventricularly to rats subjected to stress and compared to normal rabbit serum. When TRH was administered subcutaneously in rats subjected to stress, it significantly aggravated ulcer formation, and this effect was inhibited by atropine and vagotomy. When administered intracerebroventricularly, TRH alone induced, in a dose-dependent fashion, the formation of gastric ulcers. TRH antiserum infused intracerebroventricularly inhibited ulcer formation induced by cold-restraint stress. In conclusion, TRH seems to play a role in stress ulcer formation, possibly by a cholinergic mediated mechanism.\r"

Purified PECs (2-3 X 10(6) cells) prepared from Wistar rat islets were transplanted in 10 different sites in streptozocin-induced diabetic ACI rats. Blood glucose and body weight changes were monitored throughout the study. PEC isografts (n = 5) and allografts (n = 6) were nonfunctional when transplanted in intramuscular, intravenous, and intrahepatic sites. When transplanted intraportally (n = 6) and intraperitoneally (n = 6), similar grafts were functional but had a short survival period (6.6 +/- 1.5 and 15.3 +/- 16.6 days, respectively). Prolonged graft survival in some recipients was observed when kidney capsule [5, 9, 10, 240, 282, and 300 (2 rats) days], omentum pocket (7, 8, 10, 90, 105, 154, 155, and 157 days), and testis (7, 8, 12, 150, 230, and 234 days) were the transplantation sites. Permanent graft survival was achieved in 20 of 20 recipients with intracerebral transplantation and 21 of 22 recipients with intrathecal transplantation. These findings confirm that dispersed single PECs can be transplanted as a permanent functional graft and can normalize the hyperglycemia of the diabetic recipients. The duration of PEC graft survival is variable and depends on the transplantation site. Both the cerebral cortex and subarachnoid space, which are immunologically privileged sites, have provided the best allograft protection.\r"

  ".W": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by superfused glomeruli from rats made diabetic for 2 wk by streptozocin injection is twofold higher than that by glomeruli from normal rats. The higher rates of PGE2 production by glomeruli from diabetic rats are associated with higher levels of labeled free arachidonate in glomeruli prelabeled with [3H]arachidonate, both basally and after stimulation with Ca2+ ionophore A23187. The difference between release of labeled arachidonate from phospholipids of diabetic versus normal glomeruli is likely underestimated by measurements of arachidonate alone due to more rapid incorporation of released arachidonate into triacylglycerol of diabetic glomeruli. A23187 induced a fall in labeled phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol in glomeruli that had been prelabeled with [3H]arachidonate and also induced a reduction in the mass of these phospholipids. Consistent with the higher levels of labeled arachidonate, the reduction in both labeled phospholipids and phospholipid mass with A23187 was greater in glomeruli from diabetic than normal rats. Furthermore, the reduction in labeled phospholipids and phospholipid mass with A23187 was largely (62-80%) accounted for by a fall in phosphatidylcholine plus phosphatidylethanolamine in glomeruli from both normal and diabetic rats. These results suggest a primary role for phospholipase A2 in A23187 actions on glomerular arachidonate release in normal rats and for the higher levels of arachidonate found in glomeruli from diabetic rats. Nevertheless, A23187 also stimulated the production of inositol phosphates--a measure of cellular phospholipase C activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is characterized by fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia in conjunction with reduced rates of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and storage in peripheral tissues, including muscle. Our objectives in this study were to determine whether ingestion of a mixed meal activates GS in control nondiabetic subjects and whether meal-related GS activation is reduced in NIDDM. To accomplish this, mixed formula meals were administered to 11 NIDDM and 9 age- and weight-matched nondiabetic control subjects. Plasma glucose and insulin values were measured before and for 90 min after meal ingestion. Skeletal muscle biopsies were performed just before and 90 min after meal ingestion for measurement of GS activity. Compared with control subjects, NIDDM subjects had significantly higher postprandial hyperglycemia and reduced postprandial hyperinsulinemia. GS was activated by meal ingestion in control subjects to a significantly greater extent than in NIDDM subjects. In NIDDM subjects, activation of GS was inversely correlated with fasting plasma glucose (r = .69, P less than .05). Therefore, NIDDM is characterized by reduced activation of a key step in the process of muscle glycogen repletion after a meal. Reduced activation of GS by a mixed meal in NIDDM may contribute to the reduced glucose disposal after a meal, thus contributing to the hyperglycemia observed in these subjects.\r"

  ".W": "A decrease in maximal O2 uptake has been demonstrated with increasing altitude. However, direct measurements of individual links in the O2 transport chain at extreme altitude have not been obtained previously. In this study we examined eight healthy males, aged 21-31 yr, at rest and during steady-state exercise at sea level and the following inspired O2 pressures (PIO2): 80, 63, 49, and 43 Torr, during a 40-day simulated ascent of Mt. Everest. The subjects exercised on a cycle ergometer, and heart rate was recorded by an electrocardiograph; ventilation, O2 uptake, and CO2 output were measured by open circuit. Arterial and mixed venous blood samples were collected from indwelling radial or brachial and pulmonary arterial catheters for analysis of blood gases, O2 saturation and content, and lactate. As PIO2 decreased, maximal O2 uptake decreased from 3.98 +/- 0.20 l/min at sea level to 1.17 +/- 0.08 l/min at PIO2 43 Torr. This was associated with profound hypoxemia and hypocapnia; at 60 W of exercise at PIO2 43 Torr, arterial PO2 = 28 +/- 1 Torr and PCO2 = 11 +/- 1 Torr, with a marked reduction in mixed venous PO2 [14.8 +/- 1 (SE) Torr]. Considering the major factors responsible for transfer of O2 from the atmosphere to the tissues, the most important adaptations occurred in ventilation where a fourfold increase in alveolar ventilation was observed. Diffusion from alveolus to end-capillary blood was unchanged with altitude. The mass circulatory transport of O2 to the tissue capillaries was also unaffected by altitude except at PIO2 43 Torr where cardiac output was increased for a given O2 uptake. Diffusion from the capillary to the tissue mitochondria, reflected by mixed venous PO2, was also increased with altitude. With increasing altitude, blood lactate was progressively reduced at maximal exercise, whereas at any absolute and relative submaximal work load, blood lactate was higher. These findings suggest that although glycogenolysis may be accentuated at low work loads, it may not be maximally activated at exhaustion.\r"

The injections evoked an initial transient inhibition of ongoing PN or IIC activity with a mean onset latency of 0.17 s, followed by excitation of subsequent respiratory activities with an onset latency ranging from 0.4 to 2.7 s; the average onset latency of expiratory excitation (1.49 s) was significantly longer than that of inspiratory facilitation (0.89 s). The initial inhibitory responses were analogous to reflex effects of injections of phenyl biguanide, indicating that the initial inhibition was due to activation of vascular nociceptors and the subsequent excitation was due to stimulation of the central chemoreceptors. In addition, CO2-saline injections during hypocapnic apnea developed a quick reappearance of respiratory rhythm, and the first facilitatory effect appeared in tonic IIC activity, which became more active before rhythm started. In summary, the present study, by use of a technique of vertebral arterial injections of 100% CO2-saline, revealed dynamic properties of respiratory control system mediated by central chemoreceptors and vascular nociceptors.\r"

Surgical removal of the carotid bodies abolishes this interaction. Since halothane anesthesia in hyperoxia greatly impairs peripheral chemoreflexes, experiments were conducted to determine whether hypercapnia would attenuate the effects of Paw on f and TE in halothane-anesthetized dogs (approximately 1.5 minimum alveolar concentration). Integrated activity of the phrenic nerve was monitored as a function of Paw (2-12 cmH2O) in a vascularly isolated left lung at varied levels of arterial PCO2 (PaCO2; 38-80 Torr) controlled by inspired gas concentrations ventilating the denervated but perfused right lung. Halothane was administered only to the right lung. The results were as follows: 1) integrated phrenic amplitude increased with PaCO2 but was unaffected by Paw; 2) f decreased as Paw increased but was not affected by PaCO2; 3) the inspiratory duration (TI) increased as PaCO2 increased but was unaffected by Paw; 4) TE increased as Paw increased but was unaffected by PaCO2; and 5) there was no phrenic response to intravenous sodium cyanide (50-100 micrograms/kg). Thus, unlike chloralose-urethan-anesthetized dogs, hypercapnia does not attenuate the effect of lung inflation on f or TE in halothane-anesthetized dogs. Furthermore, hypercapnia increases TI during halothane anesthesia, an effect found after carotid denervation but not found in intact chloralose-urethan-anesthetized dogs. It is suggested that these differences between chloralose-urethan- and halothane-anesthetized dogs may be due to functional carotid chemoreceptor denervation by halothane.\r"

On a background of continuous CO2-stimulated hyperventilation, hypoxia was introduced and sustained for 25 min. Initially, with the introduction of hypoxia onto hypercapnia, there was a brisk additional increase in inspiratory minute ventilation (VI) to 284% of resting VI, but the response was not sustained and hypoxic VI declined by 36% to a level intermediate between the initial increase and the preexisting hypercapnic hyperventilation. Through the continuous hypercapnia, the changes in hypoxic ventilation resulted from significant alterations in tidal volume (VT) and mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI) without changes in respiratory timing. In another experiment, sustained hypoxia was introduced on the usual background of room air, either with isocapnia or without maintenance of end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) (poikilocapnic hypoxia). Regardless of the degree of maintenance of ETCO2, during 25 min of sustained hypoxia, VI showed an initial brisk increase and then declined by 35-40% of resting VI to a level intermediate between the initial response and resting room air VI. For both isocapnia and poikilocapnic conditions, the attenuation of VI was an expression of a diminished VT. Thus the decline in ventilation with sustained hypoxia occurred regardless of the background ETCO2, suggesting that the mechanism underlying the hypoxic decline is independent of CO2.\r"

Twelve male cyclists exercised continuously for 70 min on a cycle ergometer at 68% VO2max, interrupted by six 2-min intervals at 88% VO2max, on two separate occasions. A 25% carbohydrate solution (2 g/kg body wt) was ingested immediately postexercise (P-EX) or 2 h postexercise (2P-EX). Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis at 0, 2, and 4 h postexercise. Blood samples were obtained from an antecubital vein before and during exercise and at specific times after exercise. Muscle glycogen immediately postexercise was not significantly different for the P-EX and 2P-EX treatments. During the first 2 h postexercise, the rate of muscle glycogen storage was 7.7 mumol.g wet wt-1.h-1 for the P-EX treatment, but only 2.5 mumol.g wet wt-1.h-1 for the 2P-EX treatment. During the second 2 h of recovery, the rate of glycogen storage slowed to 4.3 mumol.g wet wt-1.h-1 during treatment P-EX but increased to 4.1 mumol.g wet wt-1.h-1 during treatment 2P-EX. This rate, however, was still 45% slower (P less than 0.05) than that for the P-EX treatment during the first 2 h of recovery. This slower rate of glycogen storage occurred despite significantly elevated plasma glucose and insulin levels. The results suggest that delaying the ingestion of a carbohydrate supplement post-exercise will result in a reduced rate of muscle glycogen storage.\r"

Naloxone increased plasma beta-endorphin and adrenocorticotropic hormone at rest but had no effect on resting heart rate, aortic pressure, cardiac output, left ventricular time derivative of pressure (dP/dt) and ratio of dP/dt at a developed pressure of 50 mmHg and the developed pressure (dP/dt/P), or plasma catecholamines. Plasma beta-endorphin and adrenocorticotropic hormone increased during exercise. In addition, graded treadmill exercise produced proportional increases in heart rate, cardiac output, aortic pressure, left ventricular dP/dt and dP/dt/P, and blood flow to exercising muscles, right and left ventricular myocardium, and adrenal glands. However, there were no differences in the circulatory responses to exercise between animals receiving naloxone and normal saline. Thus the endogenous opiate system probably does not play an important role in regulating the systemic hemodynamic and blood flow responses to mild and moderate exercise.\r"

In this study similar application of DEPC inhibits the phrenic nerve response to CO2 expressed as a function of VLM [H+] measured by surface pH electrode. Attempts to evaluate direct chemoreceptor stimulation by HCL-soaked surface pledgets proved difficult, but rostral DEPC did inhibit the response to intravenous infusion of HCl. As previously reported, the CO2 and intravenous H+ responses are not a unique function of the VLM [H+]. DEPC had similar inhibitory effects on both the CO2 and the intravenous H+ responses, suggesting that the difference between them may reflect more the orientation or accessibility of the central chemoreceptor than a different mechanism for sensing CO2 vs. H+. DEPC did not alter the phrenic nerve response to hypoxia, indicating that DEPC effects on central chemoreception are not the result of a generalized inhibitory process. The results support the hypothesis that imidazolehistidine is involved at the rostral area with chemoreception of both CO2 and H+.\r"

Three ranges of arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) were examined: less than or equal to 26, 36-50, and greater than or equal to 89 Torr. The diaphragm was fatigued with repetitive phrenic stimulation (30 Hz). During the fatiguing activity, five of the animals were subjected to hypercapnia and the other five to hypocapnia. A frequency-Pdi curve was generated for each period in the protocol. The data show that 1) fatiguing to 50% of the initial Pdi value during hypercapnia was significantly more rapid than during hypocapnia; 2) both the prefatigue and postfatigue mean Pdi values over all interactions of frequency, fatigue, and PaCO2 were unaffected by the fatiguing environment (hypercapnia vs. hypocapnia); 3) the percent reduction of Pdi by hypercapnia was the same at all four frequencies; 4) hypocapnia did not alter either the pre- or postfatigue frequency-Pdi curve; and 5) one-half relaxation time, unaffected by PaCO2, was prolonged by fatigue. We conclude that the hypercapnic diaphragm has less endurance than the hypocapnic diaphragm and that although both fatigue and hypercapnia decrease Pdi, they appear to be separate entities working through different mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of acute cyclooxygenase (CYO) inhibition on the cardiopulmonary adjustments at birth was examined in chronically instrumented, unanesthetized, term lambs before, during, and after cesarean section (spontaneous respiration). One of three infusions was started 20 min before birth: saline control (C, n = 6), indomethacin (I, n = 6), or meclofenamate (M, n = 3). The stable metabolite of prostacyclin, plasma 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha, aorta), was measured by radioimmunoassay as an index of CYO activity. Indomethacin blocked the rise of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha observed in control lambs after birth and indomethacin-treated lambs exhibited an attenuation of the postnatal decrease in mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) was 53 +/- 2 and 47 +/- 2 Torr (mean +/- SE) at 15 min and 40 +/- 3 and 34 +/- 2 Torr at 120 min in I and C groups, respectively. There were no serial or group differences in cardiac output and cardiac right to left shunt (indicator dilution) from 15 to 120 min after birth. Arterial PO2 (PaO2) was not different between groups: 37 +/- 4 Torr at 15 min and 47 +/- 5 min at 120 min after birth (control lambs). The results for I and M were similar for all measurements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported that recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induces HLA-DR (human lymphocyte antigen) molecules of the major histocompatibility complex in human endometrial epithelial cells in vitro. We now report that IFN-gamma inhibits the proliferation of human endometrial epithelial cells and a human endometrial carcinoma cell line (EnCa101AE). Human endometrial epithelial cells expressed HLA-DR molecules and underwent morphological changes when exposed to IFN. Furthermore, the proliferation of these cells, as evidenced by nuclear labeling of bromodeoxyuridine (an analog of thymidine that is incorporated into cells in S phase), was markedly reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, by IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma induced HLA-DR expression, morphological changes, shedding from the substratum, and cell death in EnCa101AE cells. In addition, cell number and the numbers of bromodeoxyuridine-, Ki-67 (a nuclear marker of proliferation)-, and MPM-2 (a marker of mitotic cells)-positive cells were markedly lower in the EnCa101AE cultures treated with IFN-gamma than those in control cultures. The cytostatic and HLA-DR-inducing effects of IFN-gamma could be abrogated by neutralization with a polyclonal antibody, and IFN-gamma effects were reversible within days after its withdrawal. These findings indicate that IFN-gamma inhibits proliferation of human endometrial epithelial cells and suggest that this factor may locally regulate the proliferation of these epithelial cells in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "88244015\r", 
  ".W": "The pulse frequency, amplitude, and mode of administration of GnRH all influence gonadotropin secretion and, ultimately, pituitary-gonadal function. We studied plasma LH responses to repetitive iv administration of GnRH given hourly for 5 h as a 2-microgram rapid (less than 15 s) bolus dose or a 2-microgram dose infused for 15 min of each hour in seven women deficient in endogenous GnRH and sex steroids. Plasma LH levels, measured at 10-min intervals throughout the 5-h period, rose more briskly (pattern X time course interactions: F = 3.33; P less than 0.0001) to higher levels overall (F = 11.7; P = 0.014) after rapid bolus GnRH administration than after GnRH infusion. Plasma FSH levels increased during both modes of delivery, with higher responses to rapid bolus GnRH administration (P = 0.005). Plasma estradiol levels did not change during either 5-h study. We conclude that the pattern of delivery of GnRH is a determinant of pituitary LH and FSH secretion in untreated hypogonadotropic women, and therefore, that alterations in the GnRH wave form and/or peak plasma GnRH concentrations consequent upon different rates of GnRH entry into the blood-stream may explain the different responses that occur when GnRH is given by different routes.\r"

We studied the effect of GnRH analog treatment in two such patients, one with a recurrent FSH- and LH-secreting pituitary adenoma (patient 1) and one with a recurrent FSH- and alpha-subunit-secreting pituitary adenoma (patient 2). Patient 1 was treated with 200 micrograms Buserelin daily for 65 days, and patient 2 received three injections of 3 mg [D-Trp6]-LHRH formulated in microcapsules at 21-day intervals. In both patients, plasma FSH, LH (RIA), and alpha-subunit concentrations increased initially and remained above the pretreatment values throughout the treatment period. Plasma LH, measured by immunoradiometric assay, remained well above the detection limit. Plasma bioactive LH and testosterone became undetectable in patient 2, but did not change in patient 1. In neither patient did pituitary tumor size (determined by computed tomographic scan) change during treatment. We conclude that 1) the overall effect of GnRH analogs in patients with gonadotroph cell adenomas is stimulation of gonadotropin release by the tumor, although LH release varies according to how plasma LH is measured, possibly related to the origin of the hormone (normal or tumor gonadotroph cells), and 2) GnRH analog treatment does not reduce tumor size.\r"

The degree of increase was similar in both NDI patients and normal subjects.

We measured fractional whole body retention of orally ingested 47Ca, an index of calcium absorption, in nine normal women after they had eaten a 2000-mg calcium diet for 8 weeks and a 300-mg calcium diet for 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks. After the diet change, serum intact PTH (32.2% increase; P = 0.005), serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D; 43.8% increase; P = 0.003], and fractional whole body calcium retention (42.8% increase; P = 0.004) increased within 1 week. Although the PTH and calcium retention responses remained fairly constant throughout the low calcium intake period, serum 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations declined toward baseline after week 1. Thus, the late increase in calcium retention may have resulted from calcium absorption that was independent of 1,25-(OH)2D stimulation.\r"

In older patients, the frequency and content of the two low mol wt forms, especially beta ANP, were increased.

To determine the effect of body position and short-term pharmacologic intervention on radionuclide angiographically determined left ventricular peak filling rate, high temporal resolution time-activity curves and absolute left ventricular volumes obtained by equilibrium-gated blood pool scans were evaluated in 12 normal subjects in the supine position at rest and in response to several postural and pharmacologic manipulations. This study confirmed the reproducibility of the technique and demonstrated that in normal subjects, peak filling rate varies in response to changes in body position and to short-term administration of sublingual nitroglycerin and intravenous verapamil. Peak filling rate ranged from 3.3 to 5.1 end-diastolic volumes (EDV)/s with a variability of 13.7% during five baseline supine measurements in the 12 subjects. Compared with values in the supine position (mean +/- SEM = 4.38 +/- 0.24 EDV/s), peak filling rate increased +16 +/- 6% to 4.75 +/- 0.27 EDV/s in the upright position (p less than 0.05) but did not change significantly with leg elevation. Peak filling rate at baseline and during postural changes correlated significantly with ejection fraction (r = +0.49), with stroke volume (r = +0.26) and inversely with end-systolic volume (r = -0.41), but did not correlate with heart rate or blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The cardiac release and total body and renal clearances and the hemodynamic, renal and endocrine effects of increasing doses of atrial natriuretic peptide were investigated in 12 patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure. Immunoreactive arterial plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide were 10-fold higher than normal and there was no correlation between aortic atrial natriuretic peptide and cardiac filling pressures. The heart released atrial natriuretic peptide into the coronary sinus. The kidney, though a major clearance site, accounted for only 33% of the total body clearance. Administration of 0.3 micrograms/kg per min atrial natriuretic peptide produced significant changes in heart rate (95 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 4 beats/min) and mean arterial (92 +/- 8 to 77 +/- 9 mm Hg), right atrial (13 +/- 3 to 8 +/- 2 mm Hg) and mean pulmonary artery occluded (27 +/- 3 to 14 +/- 3 mm Hg) pressures. Atrial natriuretic peptide increased cardiac index (2.25 +/- 0.18 to 2.83 +/- 0.3 liters/min per m2) and stroke work index (21 +/- 1.5 to 29 +/- 3.4 g/m2), whereas systemic vascular resistance (1,424 +/- 139 to 1,033 +/- 97 dynes.s.cm(-5)) decreased. Infusion of 0.1 microgram/kg per min atrial natriuretic peptide increased urinary flow 128%, fractional excretion of sodium 133% and fractional excretion of potassium 35%. The filtration fraction increased from 29 +/- 2 to 31 +/- 4%. This represented a disproportionate rise in glomerular filtration rate over renal plasma flow. Plasma aldosterone and norepinephrine decreased whereas plasma renin activity remained unchanged. In association with these hemodynamic, excretory and endocrine changes, the urinary excretion of cyclic guanosine monophosphate doubled. Placebo had no effect. These results showed that, despite high circulating levels of atrial natriuretic peptide, administration of this hormone in heart failure is associated with potentially beneficial hemodynamic, renal and endocrine effects.\r"

Terbutaline was administered by continuous face mask nebulization at a dose equaling the most frequent previous intermittent dose per hour (4 mg per hour). No patient with frank respiratory failure (i.e., PaCO2 greater than or equal to 60 torr, exhaustion, or coma) was studied. All patients improved, and therapy was stopped in a mean of 15.4 hours (range 3 to 37 hours). The average heart rate did not increase over baseline measurements through 24 hours of CNT. The mean clinical asthma score improved significantly during 8 hours, falling from 6.9 to 3.2 (p greater than 0.001). In 14 patients whose PaCO2 was greater than or equal to 39 torr (range 39 to 58 torr) and clinical asthma score was 6 or greater, PaCO2 decreased a mean of 11.7 torr during a mean of 8.1 hours. In six patients whose PaCO2 was 45 torr or greater at the start of CNT (mean 49, range 45 to 58 torr) and in whom we would have previously treated with intravenous isoproterenol, PaCO2 decreased a mean of 15 torr in an average of 8.7 hours. This preliminary study suggests that CNT is an effective therapy for severe asthma in children.\r"

Members of the other group received terfenadine and a placebo that looked like flurbiprofen. This treatment lasted 1 week. Subjects recorded severity of congestion, drainage, running, nose blowing, itching, and sneezing four times each day. The flurbiprofen-treated patients experienced less severe symptoms, demonstrating maximum benefit 3 to 5 days into the drug trial with some loss of effect thereafter. Secretion-related symptoms appeared to benefit most. Combined blockade of histamine and cyclooxygenase products appears to offer improved symptom control in ragweed hay fever.\r"

These results suggest that granule enzyme secretion is another indicator of TCR-mediated activation and provides a possible mechanism for Th cell function via a rapid, local delivery of granule contents to adjacent cells.\r"

We found that a substantial number of AIDS patients with neurologic involvement had oligoclonal IgG bands in CSF and sera by IEF. Using an IEF-Ag overlay technique, anti-gp120 antibody activity was demonstrated more frequently than anti-p24 antibody activity. These antibody activities exhibited restricted heterogeneity of their IEF pattern; this restriction may contribute to the relatively low titers of neutralizing antibody found in AIDS sera. None of the CSF and serum oligoclonal bands showed anti-HIV antibody activity, suggesting that they are directed against opportunistic agents or result from immunodysregulation.\r"

  ".W": "The role of IL-4 in human B cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation was examined. rIL-2, but not rIL-4, was able to promote maximum proliferation and generation of Ig-secreting cells in cultures of highly purified B cells stimulated with Cowan I Staphylococcus aureus (SA). Addition of rIL-4 to rIL-2-supported cultures of SA-stimulated peripheral blood, spleen, or lymph node B cells dramatically suppressed both proliferation and differentiation. Results from experiments in which rIL-4 was added to culture at progressively later times indicated a requirement for rIL-4 to be present during the first 2 days of a 5-day incubation to cause inhibition of responsiveness. When a two-stage culture system was utilized, rIL-4 was found to support proliferation or differentiation of B cells initially activated with SA for 2 days only minimally. However, rIL-4 did not inhibit responses of SA preactivated B cells supported by IL-2. The presence of rIL-4 during the initial 48-h activation of B cells with SA and rIL-2 resulted in a profound inhibition of the ability of the activated B cells to respond subsequently to rIL-2 or lymphokine-rich T cell supernatants. A similar 48-h incubation with rIL-4 alone without SA had no effect on subsequent B cell responsiveness. The presence of rIFN-gamma during B cell activation decreased the inhibitory effect of IL-4. Other cytokines including IFN-alpha, IL-1, and commercially available low m.w. B cell growth factor also diminished the inhibitory effect of IL-4. These results indicate that IL-4 inhibits the capacity of human B cells to be activated maximally by SA and rIL-2 and therefore suggest a new immunomodulatory role for this cytokine.\r"

  ".W": "We previously found that IL-2 rapidly induced protein phosphorylation of a 67-kDa (pp67) and four 63-kDa (pp63s) cellular proteins in various T cells. Here, we show that the IL-2-stimulated phosphorylation is mediated by the IL-2R beta-chain composed of the high affinity IL-2R, and induced by activation of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PKC). The IL-2-stimulated phosphorylation was always observed in various T cell lines bearing high affinity IL-2R, but never observed in cells which express only low affinity IL-2R consisted of alpha-chain alone. When the expression of high affinity IL-2R was modified by anti-IL-2R mAb for reducing the affinity to 8- to 10-fold lower without affecting the sites of IL-2R, the effective dose of IL-2 on phosphorylation of pp67 increased 8 to 10 times. When cells were treated with pronase, approximately 95% sites of low affinity IL-2R were selectively decreased, but the IL-2 dose dependency for pp67 phosphorylation was little affected. These data exactly suggest that protein phosphorylation in response to IL-2 such as pp67 and pp63s, is mediated by high affinity but not low affinity IL-2R. Furthermore, the IL-2-stimulated phosphorylation of these proteins was also observed in MLA 144 cells which express only low affinity IL-2R consisting of beta-chain alone. In addition, various phorbol esters and tumor promoters, which activate PKC, were also demonstrated to induce the phosphorylation of a pp67 and pp63s in these T cell lines. Therefore, the present study suggests that IL-2/IL-2R beta-chain interaction triggers the phosphorylation of pp67 and pp63s, where the PKC may have an important role.\r"

The CSF were released only when PHA was used, whether or not rhuTNF-alpha and/or rhuIFN-gamma were present while the lymphocytes conditioned the medium. T lymphocytes were sorted into subsets by using three-color immunofluorescence and a dye laser flow cytometry system with cells incubated with biotin anti-Leu-4 labeled with Texas Red, FITC-conjugated anti-Leu-3a, and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-Leu-2a. Both the Leu-4+3a+2a- and the Leu-4+2a+3a- cells released CSF in response to PHA, but the release of CSF from PHA-stimulated lymphocytes was enhanced by rhuTNF-alpha and rhuIFN-gamma only from the Leu-4+3a+2a- subset of cells. Use of the three-color cell sorting made it highly unlikely that NK cells were involved, because both sorted subsets were positive for Leu-4. rhuTNF-alpha and rhuIFN-gamma synergized to enhance release of CSF such that low concentrations of each molecule, which were inactive when used alone, were active when the two molecules were used together. These studies suggest a role, at least in vitro, for TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in the release of CSF from subsets of T lymphocytes stimulated with PHA.\r"

  ".U": "88244400\r", 
  ".W": "Early events in the transformation of schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni include shedding of the glycocalyx and conversion of the parasite from sensitive to resistant to complement-mediated killing. This is accompanied by a release of proteolytic activity which occurs at the same rate as the first two phenomena and is also complete within 1 h of culture at 37 degrees C in defined synthetic medium. Two serine proteases, of 28 kDa and a 60 kDa, were purified to homogeneity from the culture medium of transforming schistosomula; the purification steps and the initial characterization of these proteases are reported elsewhere. Both proteases accelerated the release of surface molecules from the schistosomula; however, the effect of the 28-kDa protease was much more pronounced. Qualitative analysis of the material cleaved from the schistosomula by the purified proteases on SDS-PAGE revealed a fragmentation pattern identical with that of the material shed spontaneously from transforming schistosomula. This strongly suggests that the 28-kDa and 60-kDa proteases contribute physiologically to the release of the schistosomular surface molecules including the high Mr glycocalyx. The activity of the two proteases was inhibited by PMSF. Freshly transformed schistosomula treated shortly with the purified 28-kDa protease produced a lower C consumption and became more refractory to C killing. Both consumption and killing were mediated by the alternative pathway of C in the absence of antibodies. These results postulate a role for proteases secreted by transforming schistosomula in the release of schistosomular surface molecules which activate C. This may serve as an escape mechanism from C damage employed by transforming schistosomula.\r"

  ".W": "Co-culture of blood forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, with human PBMC impaired the capacity of T lymphocytes to express surface receptors for IL-2. This effect was evidenced by marked reductions in both the proportion of Tac+ cells and the density of Tac Ag on the surface of the positive cells, determined by flow cytometry. The extent of the inhibition increased with parasite concentration. Under optimal or suboptimal conditions of stimulation with either PHA or monoclonal anti-CD3, specific for an epitope of the T3-Ti human T cell Ag receptor complex, the presence of T. cruzi curtailed the capacity of T lymphocytes to proliferate and express Il-2R but did not affect IL-2 production. Furthermore, the addition of exogenous IL-2 did not restore the responsiveness of suppressed human lymphocytes but did when mouse lymphocytes were used instead. Therefore, unlike mouse lymphocytes, human lymphocyte suppression by T. cruzi did not involve deficient IL-2 production and was accompanied by impaired IL-2 utilization. Co-culture of human monocytes/macrophages with suppressive concentrations of T. cruzi increased IL-1 production, and the parasite did not decrease IL-1 secretion stimulated by a bacterial LPS. Therefore, the suppression of IL-2R expression and lymphoproliferation is not likely to have been an indirect consequence of insufficient IL-1 production due to infection of monocytes or macrophages. We have shown that suppression of human lymphocyte proliferation by T. cruzi is not caused by nutrient consumption, absorption of IL-2, lymphocyte killing, or mitogen removal by the parasite. Therefore, these results uncover a novel suppressive mechanism induced by T. cruzi, involving inhibited expression of IL-2R after lymphocyte activation and rendering T cells unable to receive the IL-2 signal required for continuation of their cell cycle and mounting effective immune responses.\r"

Several transfectants which received only the beta-chain gene of I-Ad, expressed I-Ad proteins on the cell surface. Their presence was determined by direct immunofluorescence and by Northern blot hybridization as well as RNA dot blot hybridization. These I-Ad molecules could induce IL-2 production in I-Ad restricted T cell hybridomas. When I-Ad molecules are expressed on the cell surface of the transfectants, they become fully active in inducing the I-Ad restricted T cell response. The original B cell hybridomas used for transfection possessed the alpha and beta chain genes of the I-Ad molecule but there are no transcripts of these genes in the cell. We suppose that many copies of the transfected beta-chain gene or its product may also induce production of cellular alpha-chain gene products and thereby induce expression of the I-Ad molecule on the cell surface.\r"

DNA sequencing of the VDJ region of pVCM determined that the VH gene was a member of the J558 family rearranged to JH2. Upon transfection into myeloma cells the gamma 2b gene gave rise to high levels of gamma 2b mRNA and gamma 2b protein. The gamma 2b protein had the same IEF pattern as the parent hybridoma protein VD93 and the antibodies formed from a combination of the pVCM gamma 2b chains and the myeloma lambda-chains bound weakly to P. aeruginosa. However, the hybrid antibodies did not discriminate between the serotypes 2 and 3, whereas the parent protein was specific for serotype 3. Transgenic mice were produced with the pVCM gamma 2b gene which expressed the gamma 2b mRNA (both membrane and secreted forms) only in lymphoid organs. However, contrary to expectations, the gamma 2b mRNA levels were higher in T cells than in B cells in three different transgenic lines. The serum of the transgenic mice had no activity to P. aeruginosa indicating the importance of L chains for the conformation of the Ag binding site. These gamma 2b transgenic mice provide a convenient tool for the study of feedback inhibition of Ig gene rearrangement.\r"

Tumors developing in animals despite antibody therapy were examined by immunofluorescence and found to demonstrate either loss of surface Ig, or expression of an altered idiotype that no longer bound the antibody used for treatment. Further immunofluorescence analysis of the variant tumors revealed individual patterns of cross-reactivity with anti-38C13 idiotype mAb other than that used for therapy. The variant tumor cells were fused to myeloma cells and hybrids were isolated which secreted large quantities of the altered idiotype proteins. Polyclonal antibodies and mAb prepared against the mutant proteins demonstrated cross-reactivity with the original 38C13 protein and its other variants. But the variants and wild type cells could be distinguished from each other by their patterns of reactivity with the panels of anti-idiotype antibodies. Differences in apparent m.w. were demonstrated in the L chains of each of the mutant proteins. Southern blot analysis of the H chain locus of these mutants established that they were all clonally related; however, the L chain loci were grossly different. Thus, rare cells with alteration in their Ig L chain genes and expressed proteins can give rise to idiotype variants in this B cell tumor.\r"

  ".U": "88244419\r", 
  ".W": "We previously demonstrated that a lymphoid dendritic cell-like tumor line (P388AD.2) presented a normally tolerogenic signal, fluoresceinated sheep gamma-globulin (FL-SGG), as an immunogenic one. In contrast, macrophages derived from the peritoneal cavity potentiated the ability of FL-SGG to induce B cell unresponsiveness. In this paper we examined whether two different Ia+ splenic accessory cells differentially presented tolerogen to spleen cells or fluorescein (FL)-binding B cells. Interestingly, lymphoid dendritic cells presented FL-SGG to spleen cells and elicited augmented anti-FL antibody responses, whereas splenic macrophages presented this same moiety and elicited hapten-specific B cell unresponsiveness. The mechanism of splenic macrophage-elicited B cell negative signaling was investigated, and it was found that B cell unresponsiveness was abrogated in the presence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. This observation suggested a crucial role for PG in B cell negative signaling. The addition of 10 nM PGE2 restored unresponsiveness in cultures treated with indomethacin and tolerogen-pulsed macrophages, even though this dose of PG had no effect on the ability of B cells to be triggered by an immunogenic signal. A role for T cells was excluded, inasmuch as purified hapten-specific B cells were specifically tolerized by FL-SGG-pulsed macrophages. Lymphoid dendritic cells pulsed with FL-SGG did not deliver a tolerogenic or immunogenic signal to FL-specific B cells. However, when PGE2 was supplied, B cell unresponsiveness was induced. Finally, we tested whether \"non-tolerogenic\" doses of FL-SGG could render hapten-specific B cells unresponsive in the presence of PGE2, but in the absence of accessory cells. Interestingly, the combination of non-tolerogenic amounts (10 to 1000 pg/ml) of FL-SGG in conjunction with PGE2 induced unresponsiveness, whereas neither moiety alone was effective. These results suggest that splenic macrophages and lymphoid dendritic cells exert opposing effects on the immune system as evidenced by the induction of negative or positive B cell signaling. Our observations suggest that one of the key factors in controlling whether an accessory cell delivers a tolerogenic signal is the ability to secrete PG.\r"

This study has examined the capacity of AIDS PBM to lyse tumor target cells as well as their ability to secrete TNF. Untreated PBM from AIDS patients were significantly cytotoxic to U937 target cells and responded to IFN-gamma pretreatment with augmented cytotoxicity. Both the spontaneous and IFN-gamma-stimulated cytotoxic activity was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher than that observed with normal PBM. The cytotoxic activity depended on the E:T ratio used and was higher in AIDS PBM at all ratios tested (10:1 to 40:1). Because TNF has been implicated in macrophage cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we examined whether the elevated cytotoxic activity of AIDS PBM was associated with an increase in TNF production. Supernatants from PBM cultured overnight with or without IFN-gamma were tested in a bioassay measuring cytotoxicity against U937 target cells as well as in an RIA specific for TNF. Supernatants derived from either unstimulated or IFN-gamma-treated AIDS PBM exhibited significantly higher levels of cytotoxicity than supernatants from normal macrophages. Both normal and AIDS PBM produced higher levels of cytotoxic factors in response to IFN-gamma. As determined by the RIA, AIDS PBM spontaneously released high levels of TNF whereas little TNF was produced by normal PBM. Treatment with IFN-gamma augmented the level of TNF production in both AIDS and normal PBM. These results demonstrate that PBM from AIDS patients have undergone in vivo activation as manifested by both cytotoxicity against tumor target cells and production of TNF. Target cell lysis by both AIDS PBM and their supernatants was inhibited by monoclonal anti-rTNF, suggesting that the increase in PBM cell-mediated cytotoxicity was caused by an increase in TNF production. The significance of these findings in the pathogenesis of the disease is discussed.\r"

In order to further characterise changes in the aspartergic system in epileptic brain, the behaviour of aspartic acid aminotransferase (AAT), a key enzyme involved in aspartic acid metabolism has now been examined. Electrocorticography performed during surgery was employed to identify cortical epileptic spike foci in 16 patients undergoing temporal lobectomy for intractable seizures. Patients with spontaneously spiking lateral temporal cortex (n = 8) were compared with a non-spiking control group (n = 8) of patients in whom the epileptic lesions were confined to the hippocampus sparing the temporal convexity. Mean activity of AAT in spiking cortex was significantly elevated by 16-18%, with aspartic acid concentration increased by 28%. Possible explanations for the enhanced AAT activity include increased proliferation of cortical AAT-containing astrocytes at the spiking focus and/or a generalised increase in neuronal or extraneuronal metabolism consequent to the ongoing epileptic discharge. It is suggested that the data provide additional support for a disturbance of central excitatory aspartic acid mechanisms in human epileptic brain.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured in 39 men at normocapnia and after 5% CO2 inhalation using the xenon-133 technique. Twenty-three patients had unilateral carotid artery occlusion with no angiographic evidence of contralateral carotid artery stenosis or ophthalmic collateral flow. Eleven of these patients had undergone extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery. Sixteen age-matched normal men underwent CBF measurements at normocapnia and hypercapnia to provide control data. Mean hemispheric CBF was not different between hemispheres ipsilateral and contralateral to the carotid artery occlusion either in the patients who had undergone bypass surgery or in those with carotid artery occlusion alone. Considering all patients with carotid artery occlusion, mean CO2 reactivity was decreased in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the occlusion as compared to the contralateral hemisphere in both groups. Based on data from normal individuals, a hemispheric difference in CO2 reactivity of more than 0.94%/mm Hg PaCO2 or a global CO2 reactivity of less than 0.66%/mm Hg PaCO2 was considered abnormal for an individual patient. Six of 23 patients with carotid artery occlusion (three with an EC-IC bypass) had global or hemispheric abnormalities in CO2 reactivity. Patients with impaired CO2 reactivity were not distinguishable from other patients by neurological examination, presence of transient ischemic attacks, or evidence of infarction on computerized tomography scanning. This test was safe and simple to perform and may be a useful means of detecting impaired cerebrovascular collateral reserve capacity. If impaired CO2 reactivity after carotid artery occlusion proves to be associated with a high risk of subsequent stroke, the test would provide a physiological basis for selecting a subgroup of patients who could be helped by cerebral revascularization.\r"

  ".W": "The authors examined the effect of the opiate antagonists naloxone and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on neurological outcome and the size of areas of cerebral infarction in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. The middle cerebral artery (MCA) was permanently occluded in 66 adult Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were randomly divided into three groups. In 20 Group I rats, TRH in normal saline was administered initially as a 2-mg/kg bolus followed by continuous infusion of 2 mg/kg/hr for 4 hours. In 20 Group II rats, naloxone in normal saline was administered initially as a 2-mg/kg bolus followed by continuous infusion of 2-mg/kg/hr for 4 hours. In 26 Group III rats, physiological saline was administered as an initial 0.5-cc bolus followed by continuous infusion of 0.5 cc/hr for 4 hours. All solutions were given in volumes of 0.5 cc for the bolus and 0.5 cc/hr for continuous infusion, and all infusions were begun within 10 minutes of MCA occlusion. Twenty-four hours after treatment, the rats underwent a careful neurological examination and were then sacrificed immediately. The size of areas of cerebral infarction was evaluated using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining techniques. The neurological grade of the rats correlated with the size of infarcted areas among all grades, irrespective of treatment (p less than 0.01). Neither naloxone nor TRH improved neurological function or reduced the size of infarction compared to saline-treated control rats. Treatment with TRH caused a significant increase in mean arterial blood pressure during infusion, but naloxone had no effect. These results suggest that neither TRH nor naloxone are effective in the treatment of acute focal cerebral ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "The authors tried to determine whether housestaff are systematically assigned clinic patients who are more \"difficult\": the elderly, the poor, those with many problems, and those who cannot speak English. This cross-sectional study was carried out in the outpatient department of a university health care insurance. A systematic sample of 1,870 patient visits to the medical clinic from 1980 to 1986 was studied. Housestaff were more likely to see patients who did not speak English, who had four or more medical problems, who had visited the clinic five or more times, who had been admitted to the hospital or emergency ward, or who had a skin problem. Multivariate analysis of these individual factors, allowing for the effect of each upon the others, showed that only previous hospital or emergency ward admission, native language, and skin disease retained a significant association with housestaff physicians. None of these factors was strongly associated with physician status, as shown by poor predictive accuracy when the multivariate models were used to predict accuracy when the multivariate models were used to predict physician status in 105 patient visits in 1987. While some factors were statistically associated with physician status, the magnitude of the effect of each was small. An explantation, other than bias in patient assignment, was usually apparent. It is possible to organize an outpatient clinic where housestaff care for patients who are similar to those seen by faculty.\r"

None of the changes in these variables previously attributed to treatment with AF or GSTM could be demonstrated after 6-7 years' dosing. As gold compounds are effective in treating spontaneous RA in dogs, these proposed actions may not be responsible for the remittive effects of chrysotherapy in this disease.\r"

Comparable level of suppression were observed with both natural human IFN-gamma and recombinant derived human IFN-gamma. In addition, the inhibitory effects of human IFN-gamma were completely neutralized by a monoclonal antibody directed against it. Human IFN-gamma also inhibited the antigen induced production of anti-DNA synthesis by SLE-PBMC. Based on the kinetics of inhibition, human IFN-gamma appeared to be acting directly on the B cell. Lastly, human IFN-gamma also suppressed the spontaneous production of IgG and IgM by SLE-PBMC. Our findings support the conclusion that SLE Ig production can be regulated and that human IFN-gamma may be clinically useful in the treatment of SLE as well as other immune complex diseases.\r"

A 60 to 80 per cent 5-year survival rate with preservation of bladder function and control can be expected with good radiotherapeutic techniques. Except for stage Tis or early stage T1 lesions of the anterior urethra that can be treated with limited surgical excision, irradiation should be considered as an alternative to more extensive surgery for low stage bulky lesions. While there has been some success with radiation therapy alone for advanced disease, the cure rate probably can be improved with a combined approach using surgery, radiation therapy and possibly chemotherapy.\r"

Prostatic volume was reduced to 70 per cent of the pre-treatment volume by 3 months after the beginning of treatment. Prostatic blood flow was remarkably depressed in patients who had never had any treatment of the prostatic carcinoma (22.2 +/- 8.3 ml. per minute per 100 gm.), while prostatic blood flow increased significantly after endocrine treatment (56.3 +/- 21.8 ml. per minute per 100 gm.). It was likely that prostatic blood flow increased as the prostate volume decreased. Final histology of serial prostatic biopsy specimens after endocrine treatment, revealed distinct deterioration of tumor cells and slight stromal hyperplasia compared to the initial pre-treatment biopsy. The stromal-epithelial ratio, which was calculated by computer-assisted image analysis, was markedly increased after endocrine treatment. Our study indicated that endocrine treatment caused a growth-inhibitory effect that was accompanied by increased blood flow in the prostatic carcinoma.\r"

The same concentrations also disturbed other aspects of the bacterium's iron metabolism, manifested by reduced cellular levels of cytochromes and catalase. beta-lactams, except for cefotaxime, and ciprofloxacin did not reduce alginate excretion. These effects on virulence factors are likely to contribute to the efficacy of aminoglycosides.\r"

Now, neuroendocrine abnormalities are beginning to be studied in depressed children and adolescents. Results of these studies should help clarify the relationship between depression in adults and in children. Careful psychiatric diagnosis is required for studies of the neuroendocrine concomitants of depression. When establishing a diagnosis of depression in children and adolescents, one must pay attention to differences in such variables as cognitive development. Studies of neuroendocrine functioning in depressed children are at an earlier stage than those in depressed adults. To date, most studies have centered on cortisol secretion, the DST, and GH. In general, studies of cortisol secretion (most of which utilize the DST) indicate that a majority of depressed children and adolescents have positive DSTs (that is, dexamethasone fails to suppress their cortisol secretion) and cortisol secretion appears to be increased. These findings are similar to those observed in adults. Results of GH studies are more mixed. Some studies found hypersecretion of GH in depressed children, whereas others found hyposecretion of GH in depressed children. The few studies of TRH stimulation of TSH and melatonin secretion have involved a small number of subjects and results must be considered preliminary.\r"
