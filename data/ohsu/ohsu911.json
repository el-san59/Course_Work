  ".W": "The segmented pattern of the Drosophila embryo depends on a regulatory cascade involving three main classes of genes. An early regulatory programme, set up before cellularization, involves direct transcriptional regulation mediated by gap and pair-rule genes. In a second phase occurring after cellularization, interactions between segment-polarity genes are involved in cell communication. Segment-polarity genes are required for pattern formation in different domains of each metamere and act to define and maintain positional information in each segment. The segment-polarity gene fused is maternally required for correct patterning in the posterior part of each embryonic metamere. It is also necessary later in development, as fused mutations lead to anomalies of adult cuticular structures and tumorous ovaries. Here we provide molecular evidence that this gene encodes a putative serine/threonine protein kinase, a new function for the product of a segmentation gene. This result provides further insight into segment-polarity interactions and their role in pattern formation.\r"

This seems to occur by deletion of the DNa between V kappa and J kappa-C kappa if they are arranged in germ-line DNA in the same transcriptional polarity or by inversion of a fragment containing the V kappa gene if the polarities are opposite. We have cloned 75 V kappa genes and pseudogenes of the human kappa locus and linked them in large contigs. There seem to be no more than 85 such genes, less than 50 of these being potentially functional. Thirty-eight of the cloned genes have the same transcriptional polarity as J kappa-C kappa and are part of the so-called J kappa proximal cluster; 35 genes in a distal cluster (the result of a duplication event in evolution) have a polarity that was suggested to be opposite to the one of J kappa-C kappa. We now show that the V kappa genes of the proximal cluster rearrange by a deletion mechanism whereas the others join J kappa-C kappa by inversion of megabase-sized DNA fragments.\r"

Release of arachidonic acid as a result of stimulation of NMDA receptors has been proposed to play a part in the establishment of long-term potentiation. But long-term plasticity events at some other glutamatergic synapses do not involve activation of NMDA receptors. Here we report that in mature striatal neurons in primary cultures, quisqualate can release arachidonic acid by associatively activating both quisqualate metabotropic receptors coupled to phospholipase C (Qp) and Qi receptors. Independent activation of these two receptor types with specific agonists did not stimulate arachidonic acid release. These results support a role for the associative activation of Qp and Qi receptors in synaptic plasticity events, including long-term potentiation at particular synapses.\r"

Although the molecular mechanism for chilling sensitivity has long been debated, no definitive conclusion has so far been reached about its nature. A probable hypothesis, however, is that chilling injury is initiated by phase transition of lipids of cellular membranes, as demonstrated for cyanobacteria, which serve as a model system for the plant cells. Because the phase transition temperature depends on the degree of unsaturation of fatty acids of the membrane lipids, it is predicted that the chilling tolerance of plants can be altered by genetically manipulating fatty-acid desaturation by introducing double bonds into fatty acids of membrane lipids. Here we report the cloning of a gene for the plant-type desaturation (termed desA). The introduction of this gene from a chilling-resistant cyanobacterium, Synechocystis PCC6803, into a chilling-sensitive cyanobacterium, Anacystis nidulans, increases the tolerance of the recipient to low temperature.\r"

We have reconstituted the formation of constitutive secretory vesicles and immature secretory granules from the trans Golgi network in a cell-free system. We show here that the budding of both types of post-Golgi vesicles is inhibited by non-hydrolysable analogues of GTP, which suggests a more widespread role for GTP-binding proteins in membrane traffic than previously assumed.\r"

Both forms are predicted to be substrates for ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin. GoA alpha transcripts are present in a variety of tissues but are most abundant in brain. The GoB alpha transcript is expressed at highest levels in brain and testis. It is possible that GoA alpha and GoB alpha have different functions.\r"

DNA sequence analysis of one clone revealed that it encoded a partial amino acid sequence of a protein closely related to RAP2, which we have named RAP2B. A repeated screening of the platelet cDNA library with an internal Ava I fragment of the RAP2B cDNA allowed the isolation of a full-length cDNA for the RAP2B sequence. RAP2B is 90% identical to RAP2 at the amino acid level with the most variability at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Oligonucleotides were synthesized to complete the amino acid sequence of the RAP2B protein and the entire sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli. Analysis of crude soluble extracts indicated that RAP2B was a Mr 22,000 protein that specifically bound GTP on blots. Moreover, incubation of similar extracts with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase did not cause phosphorylation of RAP2B, as had been observed for the closely homologous proteins, RAP1A and RAP1B. These results suggest that RAP2B, like the other RAP proteins, is a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein in human platelets.\r"

The lateral diffusion coefficient of a fluorescent sterol probe in the plasma membrane of maize (Zea mays L.) root protoplasts in a medium containing 0.45 M mannitol was 4 times faster than when the medium contained 0.9 M mannitol. The lateral diffusion coefficient of a fluorescent phospholipid probe, however, did not change over this range of mannitol concentrations. Similar diffusion characteristics were observed when the medium contained trehalose instead of mannitol. Slower lateral diffusion of the sterol probe at higher osmolality was also observed when KCl/CaCl2-based osmotic media were used with protoplasts isolated by a mechanical, rather than by an enzymic, method. Extraction and quantitation of total lipids from protoplasts showed that both the phospholipid and sterol contents per protoplast decreased with increasing osmolality, while the sterol/phospholipid ratio increased. These results demonstrate that osmotic stress induces selective changes in both the composition and biophysical properties of plant membranes.\r"

  ".W": "Immunoglobulin- or multiple myeloma-associated amyloidosis has been distinguished by the tissue deposition of Congophilic, fibrillar protein consisting of light chains or light-chain fragments (AL amyloidosis). We now report the isolation and characterization of another form of immunoglobulin-associated amyloid obtained from a patient who had extensive systemic amyloidosis and in whom the amyloid deposits consisted not of light chains but rather of an unusual form of heavy chain. This component, isolated from splenic amyloid extracts, represented an internally deleted IgG1 heavy chain as evidenced by immunochemical, electrophoretic, and amino acid sequence analyses. A comparable immunoglobulin-related monoclonal protein, consisting only of IgG heavy chains, was present in the patient's urine. Based on serologic reactivity with a battery of anti-immunoglobulin antisera, these two immunoglobulin-related components were antigenically identical; however, when compared to normal IgG, both were deficient in Fc-associated gamma-chain determinants. The structural abnormality of the amyloid gamma-chain protein was further evidenced by SDS/PAGE and immuno-blotting analyses: An unusually low molecular mass of approximately 22 kDa was found for this material vs. the expected value of approximately 55 kDa for a normal gamma heavy chain. Despite the lack of certain Fc determinants, the amyloid and urinary heavy-chain proteins expressed the IgG1 subclass allotype marker G1m(a) located on the third constant region (CH3) domain of the internally deleted IgG1 heavy chains. That the amyloid protein contained an intact CH3 domain was established through amino acid sequence analyses of cyanogen bromide fragments and peptides generated by a lysine-specific protease. These studies also revealed that the gamma-chain amyloid protein contained the complete heavy-chain variable (VH) domain [including the diversity (DH) and joining (JH) segments] that was contiguous with the CH3 domain. The low molecular mass of the protein resulted from the total absence of the first (CH1), hinge, and second (CH2) heavy-chain constant regions. Such extensive CH deletions and the presence of a complete VH distinguish this amyloid-associated heavy chain from all other heretofore characterized gamma-heavy-chain disease proteins. This heavy-chain-related form of immunoglobulin-associated amyloidosis is tentatively designated AH amyloidosis.\r"

Among the 253 HCC patients examined, 156 (61.7%) had no serum markers of either a previous or a current HBV infection (group I), 46 (18.2%) were negative for HBV surface antigen but positive for anti-HBV surface and/or anti-HBV core antibody, indicating the occurrence of a previous, transient HBV infection (group II), and 51 (20.2%) were chronically infected HBV carriers as evidenced by positivity for HBV surface antigen (group III). The prevalence of HCV antibody in group I (68.6%) and II (58.7%) patients was significantly higher than for group III (3.9%) or in 148 additional patients with other (non-HCC) cancers (10.1%) (P less than 0.01). Thus, there appears to be a strong association between HCV infection and the development of HCC, particularly in patients for which HBV infection cannot be implicated as a causative factor. The data also suggest an additional mode of transmission for HCV other than blood transfusion, since a history of blood transfusion was shown in only about 30% of the HCV antibody-positive HCC patients in groups I and II. A high prevalence of HCV antibody was also shown among patients with HCC whose disease was originally thought to be due to very high ethanol consumption.\r"

Although this fragment determined expression of an alpha(1,2)FT whose kinetic properties mirror those of the human H blood group alpha(1,2)FT, their precise nature remained undefined. We describe here the molecular cloning, sequence, and expression of a human cDNA corresponding to these human genomic sequences. When expressed in COS-1 cells, this cDNA directs expression of cell surface H structures and a cognate alpha(1,2)FT activity with properties analogous to the human H blood group alpha(1,2)FT. The cDNA sequence predicts a 365-amino acid polypeptide characteristic of a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with a domain structure analogous to that of other glycosyltransferases but without significant primary sequence similarity to these or other known proteins. To directly demonstrate that the cDNA encodes an alpha(1,2)FT, the COOH-terminal domain predicted to be Golgi-resident was expressed in COS-1 cells as a catalytically active, secreted, and soluble protein A fusion peptide. Southern blot analysis showed that this cDNA identifies DNA sequences syntenic to the human H locus on chromosome 19. These results strongly suggest that this cloned alpha(1,2)FT cDNA represents the product of the human H blood group locus.\r"

Like homologous sugar-binding proteins in Escherichia coli, ChvE was required for chemotaxis toward galactose and several other sugars. These sugars strongly induced vir gene expression in wild-type cells when acetosyringone was absent or present in low concentrations. Mutations in chvE abolished vir gene induction by sugars and resulted in a limited host range for infection but did not affect vir gene induction by acetosyringone. A mutant lacking the periplasmic domain of VirA exhibited the same regulatory phenotype and limited host range as chvE mutants. These data show that the vir genes are regulated by two separate classes of plant-derived inducers by way of distinct regulatory pathways that can be separated by mutation. Induction by sugars is essential for infection of some but not all plant hosts.\r"

PD134308 and PD135158 produced potent anxiolytic effects in the mouse black/white box test after either subcutaneous or oral administration. There was no evidence of the development of tolerance to the anxiolytic action of either PD134308 or PD135158 in mice treated twice daily for 7 days, nor was there any sign of withdrawal anxiogenesis after abrupt termination of this treatment. Both CCK-B antagonists were able to suppress the withdrawal anxiogenesis and produce an anxiolytic effect in mice previously made tolerant to diazepam. PD134308 and PD135158 produced potent anxiolytic effects in the rat elevated plus maze test and the rat social interaction test. The effects were comparable in magnitude to those seen with diazepam. However, unlike diazepam, PD134308 and PD135158 did not produce sedation. The CCK-B antagonists also showed powerful anxiolytic activity in the \"marmoset human threat test.\" These results provide evidence of a selective role for CCK-B receptors in the control of anxiety. PD134308 and PD135158 are members of a class of anxiolytic agents that have a greatly improved profile compared with benzodiazepines or serotonin-related anxiolytics.\r"

Comparative mapping of tryptic phosphopeptides from mutant and wild-type CSF-1R indicated that tyrosine-809 is a site of ligand-dependent receptor phosphorylation in vivo. The mutant receptor was active as a tyrosine kinase in vitro and in vivo, underwent CSF-1-dependent association with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and induced expression of the protooncogenes c-fos and junB, underscoring its ability to trigger some of the known cellular responses to CSF-1. The mutant receptor is likely to be impaired in its ability to interact with critical cellular effectors whose activity is required for mitogenesis.\r"

In type II hereditary angioneurotic edema, a dysfunctional C1 inhibitor molecule is present together with low levels of normal C1 inhibitor. About 70% of these dysfunctional proteins result from reactive center (Arg-444) mutations. We describe the deletion of nucleotides encoding Lys-251 (AAG) in C1 inhibitor Ta, the dysfunctional C1 inhibitor from a family with type II hereditary angioneurotic edema. DNA sequence analysis was derived from clones obtained through polymerase chain reaction amplification of blood monocyte C1 inhibitor mRNA. As expected, clones with both normal and abnormal sequence were isolated. The deletion was verified by protein sequence analysis. These data, together with biochemical analysis of the protein and cell-free translation studies, suggest that this deletion, by altering the normal amino acid sequence from Asn-Lys-Ile-Ser to Asn-Ile-Ser, creates a new glycosylation site. The additional carbohydrate accounts for the larger size on SDS/PAGE and very likely interferes with protein function.\r"

  ".U": "90370872\r", 
  ".W": "The pathway of proton transfer in the reaction center (RC) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. Ser-L223, a putative proton donor that forms a hydrogen bond with the secondary quinone acceptor QB, was replaced with Ala and Thr. RCs with Ala-L223 displayed reduced electron transfer and proton uptake rates in the reaction QA-QB- + 2H+----QAQBH2. The rate constant for this reaction, k(2)AB, was found to be reduced approximately 350-fold to 4.0 +/- 0.2 s-1. Proton uptake measurements using a pH indicator dye showed a rapid uptake of 1 H+ per RC followed by a slower uptake of 1 H+ per RC at a rate of 4.1 +/- 0.1 s-1; native RCs showed a rapid uptake of 2H+ per RC. Evidence is provided that these changes were not due to gross structural changes in the binding site of QB. RCs with Thr-L223 showed little reduction in the rates of electron and proton transfer. These results indicate that proton transfer from the hydroxyl group of Ser-L223 or Thr-L223 is required for fast electron and proton transfer associated with the formation of the dihydroquinone QH2. In contrast, previous work showed that replacing Glu-L212, another putative proton donor to QB, with Gln slowed proton uptake from solution without significantly altering electron transfer. We propose a model that involves two distinct proton transfer steps. The first step occurs prior to transfer of the second electron to QB and involves proton transfer from Ser-L223. The second step occurs after this electron transfer through a pathway involving Glu-L212.\r"

We have examined the effects of BFA on the synthesis of glycosphingolipids (GSL) to map the intracellular sites of GSL synthesis. In several cultured cell types, BFA inhibited the synthesis of the neutral GSL gangliotriaosylceramide (GA2) and monosialoganglioside GM2 and disialoganglioside GD2, where GD2 is GalNAc(beta 1----4)- [NeuAc(alpha 2----8)NeuAc(alpha 2----3)]Gal(beta 1----4)GlcCer, GM2 lacks the NeuAc(alpha 2----8) unit, and GA2 lacks both NeuAc(alpha 2----8) and NeuAc(alpha 2----3) units. The observed decrease in labeling of GA2, GM2, and GD2 in the presence of BFA was not due either to enhanced degradation of these glycolipids or to shedding of these glycolipids from the cells. In rat liver all three of these glycolipids have been shown by others to be synthesized by the same enzyme, GA2/GM2/GD2 synthase, which catalyzes the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine to lactosylceramide (Lac-Cer), GM3 [NeuAc(alpha 2----3)Gal(beta 1----4)GlcCer], and GD3 [NeuAc(alpha 2----8)NeuAc-(alpha 2----3)Gal(beta 1----4)GlcCer], respectively. Studies with a fluorescent glycolipid analog indicated that BFA redistributed the trans-Golgi stacks into a reticular pattern characteristic of the ER. These studies localize GA2/GM2/GD2 synthase, a key enzyme involved in the synthesis of complex gangliosides, to a compartment late in the intracellular trafficking pathway, which remains functionally distinct from the ER in the presence of BFA.\r"

The method has the capacity to examine the components of mixtures without using any chromatographic separation steps and will tolerate relatively large amounts of buffers and inorganic contaminants. It allows the simultaneous determination of protein molecular masses from 1 to 40 kDa with an accuracy of +/- 0.01% and above 40 kDa with reduced accuracy. The lower limit for practical detection of a protein is a concentration of approximately 0.1 microM, and less than 1 microliter of such a solution is consumed. The analysis is very fast: less than 15 min is necessary to perform the complete analysis, including sample preparation, introduction into the mass spectrometer, mass spectrum collection, and data reduction. The mass spectrum that is obtained does not require elaborate interpretation because there is no fragmentation of the ionized protein (or protein subunit) molecule. Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the peaks in the mass spectrum and the proteins present in the original mixture. The spectra assume the appearance of chromatograms, with the abscissa being mass-to-charge ratio rather than chromatographic retention time.\r"

The allelotypic analysis was performed in 25 squamous cell carcinomas by quantitative radio-analysis of the Xba I restriction fragment length polymorphism as detected by BS9, a v-Ha-ras probe, and rehybridization of the Southern blots with probes for chromosomes 7 and 8. Approximately 85% of the tumors presented overrepresentation of the mutated allele in the form of 1 normal/2 mutated (12 tumors), 0 normal/3 mutated (4 tumors), 0 normal/2 mutated (3 tumors), and gene amplification (3 tumors). No tumor was found with a 2 normal/1 mutated allelic ratio. These results support our previous cytogenetic studies, indicating that trisomy of chromosome 7 is present in the majority of these tumors and show that nonrandom duplication of the chromosome carrying the mutated Ha-ras-1 allele appears to be a major mechanism by which the mutated gene is overrepresented.\r"

  ".U": "90370893\r", 
  ".W": "Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) has been hypothesized to function as an intercellular shuttle in the vertebrate eye, serving to transport retinoids between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors in the process by which visual pigment is regenerated after photolysis. This hypothesis was tested in preparations utilizing the toad (Bufo marinus) eye and purified, initially ligand-free IRBP obtained from the bovine eye. Rod outer segments (ROS) or neural retinas were isolated and bleached, then incubated with native RPE (RPE-eyecup) in the presence or absence of IRBP. The amount of rhodopsin present after incubation was determined by spectrophotometric analysis and compared with that in control preparations receiving bovine serum albumin or Ringer's solution only. Supplementation with IRBP enhanced the formation of rhodopsin in both the ROS/RPE-eyecup and retina/RPE-eyecup preparations. Regeneration in ROS/RPE-eyecups receiving IRBP (1.8 nmol) increased in a roughly linear manner with the period of incubation (0-4 hr), at a rate of 0.44 nmol/hr. The extent of regeneration was graded with the quantities of IRBP and opsin introduced into the RPE-eyecup. With increasing amounts of IRBP (up to 5.2 nmol) or of initially available opsin (up to 15.6 nmol), the amount of rhodopsin formed (3-hr incubation) approached the same plateau value, about 2.5 nmol. Analysis of IRBP-supplemented Ringer's solution incubated in the RPE-eyecup showed 11-cis-retinal to be virtually the only retinoid withdrawn from the RPE. With large quantities of IRBP (3.2-9.2 nmol), the amount of 11-cis-retinal (2.7 +/- 0.5 nmol) withdrawn from the RPE during a 3-hr incubation was similar to the plateau value of rhodopsin formed in the ROS/RPE-eyecup. No 11-cis-retinal was observed in albumin-supplemented Ringer's solution (0.4-11.2 nmol of bovine serum albumin) or in Ringer's alone after similar incubation in the RPE-eyecup. The results suggest that an IRBP-mediated transfer of 11-cis-retinal from the RPE to the rods supports rhodopsin regeneration in vivo.\r"

The two drugs induce strikingly different patterns of c-fos expression in the striosome-matrix compartments and limbic subdivisions of the striatum, and their effects are pharmacologically distinct, although both are sensitive to dopamine receptor blockade. We propose that differential activation of immediate-early genes by psychostimulants may be an early step in drug-specific molecular cascades contributing to acute and long-lasting psychostimulant-induced changes in behavior.\r"

Dimerization occurs via interaction between leucine zipper domains and serves to bring into proper juxtaposition a region in each protein that is rich in basic amino acids and that forms a DNA-binding domain. DNA binding of the Fos-Jun heterodimer was modulated by reduction-oxidation (redox) of a single conserved cysteine residue in the DNA-binding domains of the two proteins.

  ".W": "Heart rate is determined by pacemaker currents, of which the most important is the hyperpolarization-activated current I(f). Heart rate and I(f) are increased by beta-adrenergic agonists and decreased by muscarinic agonists released from cardiac sympathetic and vagal nerves, respectively. The hypothesis that the receptors for each agonist are directly coupled to I(f) channels by G proteins was tested. Under substrate-free conditions, preactivated G protein Gs stimulated and preactivated G protein G(o) inhibited I(f) channels of sinoatrial node pacemaker cells. These effects were mimicked by the corresponding preactivated alpha subunits of the G proteins. Unexpectedly, the two G proteins acted simultaneously, with G(o) being the more potent. This result may explain in molecular terms the classical observation in cardiac physiology, that vagal inhibition of heart rate is much greater on a background of sympathetic stimulation.\r"

  ".U": "90371452\r", 
  ".W": "Recent improvements in survival have stimulated interest in the care of elderly patients with burn injuries. We reviewed 278 patients aged 45 years and older treated during a 10-year period. The survival rate was 80% overall and 67% for patients over 75 years of age. Mortality rates correlated with patient age, burn size, presence of inhalation injury, number of complications of care, and fluid resuscitation requirements, but not with the number of preexisting medical problems. Burn wound excision and skin grafting were performed frequently and were well tolerated. During this period, hospital charges increased fourfold and were twice as great in nonsurvivors. Reimbursements based on diagnosis-related groups during the last 3 years of the review (75 patients) resulted in a total deficit of $1.2 million. Aggressive care for most elderly patients with burn injuries appears justified by the improved outcomes demonstrated. This has increased the difficulty of decisions regarding patient salvability and the allotment of resources. Elderly patients with burn injuries illustrate many contemporary dilemmas in patient care in this era of cost consciousness.\r"

This was achieved by solving the Bohr equations for mean alveolar carbon dioxide and oxygen tensions (PACO2, PAO2) from known values of the dead-space:tidal volume ratio measured by helium washout, and from the mixed expired partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygen. The derived values of wPACO2 and wPAO2 were compared with PaCO2 obtained from arterial gas analysis and PAO2 calculated from the ideal air equation. Four normal subjects and 58 patients were studied. Calculated and measured PCO2 values agreed closely with a difference in mean values (wPACO2 - PaCO2) of 0.01 kPa; the SD of the differences was 0.7 kPa. The difference in mean values between wPAO2 and PAO2 was 0.02 kPa; the SD of the differences was 0.93 kPa. The method is simple and not time consuming, and requires no special cooperation from the patients. It can be applied in the laboratory or at the bedside to any subject breathing tidally. Physiological deadspace:tidal volume ratio, PAO2 and PACO2, static lung volumes, respiratory exchange ratio, carbon dioxide production, oxygen uptake, tidal volume, and total ventilation can be measured with acceptable accuracy and reproducibility in one test. An arterial blood sample is needed initially to provide an independent measure of PaCO2 and for measurement of the alveolar-arterial PO2 difference. Subsequently, PaCO2 can be estimated from wPACO2 sufficiently well for clinical purposes and PaO2 or SaO2 can be monitored by non-invasive methods.\r"

  ".U": "90371518\r", 
  ".W": "Most of the cells found in lung parenchyma in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are activated T lymphocytes and macrophages. The serum levels of three markers of cell mediated immunity were measured in 20 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, in 20 normal subjects and in 12 patients with sarcoidosis to evaluate their clinical and prognostic significance in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The three markers were: soluble CD8 (from activated suppressor-cytotoxic lymphocytes), soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptors (from activated T cells and macrophages), and neopterin (from activated macrophages). Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had higher levels of all three markers than the control subjects. Soluble IL-2 receptor and neopterin tended to be lower (though not significantly) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis than in those with sarcoidosis, whereas soluble CD8 was similar in the two groups of patients. No correlation was found between soluble IL-2 receptors or soluble CD8 and the clinical, radiological, and physiological measures of disease activity or with clinical outcome (after a mean follow up of 23 months). Tumour necrosis factor levels were also determined. Only 30% of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or sarcoidosis had detectable circulating tumour necrosis factor; these patients had a lower percentage of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid neutrophils in their lavage fluid. Tumour necrosis factor levels did not correlate with clinical measures of severity or outcome. Thus our data support the hypothesis that cell mediated alveolitis occurs in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. They do not, however, provide evidence to support the use of these markers of cell mediated immunity to monitor the clinical course in these patients.\r"

A monoclonal protein was detected in the urine in 76% of patients; when patients with more than 1 g of protein in the urine were studied, however, a monoclonal protein was detectable in 86%.

In all three cases the keratitis resolved promptly (48 to 72 hours) without residual scarring after treatment with systemic acyclovir and topical trifluridine. The combined use of systemic acyclovir and topical trifluridine may be of similar value in treating all cases of atopic herpetic keratitis.\r"

The most common symptoms were cough (66%), hemoptysis (60%), dyspnea on exertion (53%), and wheeze (30%). Thirteen percent of the patients were asymptomatic.

Mirror laryngoscopy initially revealed the abnormalities in 30% of the patients, and bronchoscopy confirmed the diagnosis and determined the extent of the disease in all patients. Even though upper airway involvement has been thought to be uncommon, 40% of our patients demonstrated abnormalities of the larynx and upper trachea. Histologic confirmation of heterotopic bone formation was obtained in 60% of the patients. Pulmonary function tests showed mild obstructive lung disease.

The animals were then divided into two groups, one subset receiving a bisphosphonate, and the other receiving no drug. Positive air pressure was applied to one middle ear, and the other side served as a control. At the end of the experimental period, tissue specimens were obtained, and histomorphometric evaluation of the ventral bullae was performed. Significant differences in osteoclast surface, osteoclast number, and mean individual osteoclast profile area led us to conclude that administration of the bisphosphonate used at the dose studied inhibits localized recruitment and activation of osteoclasts.\r"

These antiphospholipid antibodies were originally found in patients with lupus erythematosus in whom the partial thromboplastin time was prolonged and in patients with other autoimmune diseases; subsequently, they have been observed in association with a variety of other conditions, including infections, reactions to drugs, malignant neoplasms, human immunodeficiency virus disease, and as an isolated finding. In recent years, there has been some clarification of the significance of the various tests for antiphospholipid antibodies, including the lupus anticoagulant test and the anticardiolipin antibody tests, in predicting the antiphospholipid syndrome. The mechanism of disease, however, has not been well defined. The most common cutaneous lesion seen in seven patients with lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody who have the antiphospholipid syndrome was ulceration due to thrombosis of dermal veins and arteries. Often there is a reactive vascular proliferation around the thrombosed vessels. The presence of primary thrombosis of both veins and arteries in thrombotic disorders is unusual and may provide insight into the mechanism of thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome.\r"

The patient survival rate after 2 to 8 months in the primary liver transplantation series is 93.3%, with original graft survival of 87.5%. Of the 20 patients in the hepatic retransplant series, 17 (85%) are living. Almost all of the surviving patients have good liver function. In addition 11 hearts, 2 double lungs, and a heart-lung have been transplanted under FK 506, with survival of all 14 patients. With all of the organ systems so far tested, including the kidney (which has been reported elsewhere), rejection usually has been controlled without additional drugs and with lower average steroid doses than in the past. Nephrotoxicity has been observed, but not to an alarming degree, and there has been a notable absence of hypertension. There is a suggestion that serum cholesterol may be lowered by FK 506, but this is unproved. Although the adverse reactions of FK 506 and the immunosuppressive mechanisms resemble those of cyclosporine, our preliminary observations suggest that FK 506 may have a more advantageous therapeutic index.\r"

The median time elapsed from first contact during this period to the last evaluation was 38 months (range 13-66 months). No household contact had signs or symptoms suggesting HIV infection. All 206 were negative for serum antibodies to HIV and HIV p24 antigen, despite extensive sharing of household facilities and items and personal interactions with AIDS patients.

Limb vascular resistance (blood flow measured by venous occlusion plethysmography), prostaglandin I2 (as 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha) and prostaglandin E2 plasma levels (detected by radioimmunoassay), and plasma catecholamines (detected by high-performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection) were measured. A progressive increase in the duration of the vasoconstrictor response was observed with repetition of cold applications (p less than 0.001, by analysis of variance for trends). This increase was associated with a progressive decrease in cold-induced elevation of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha and prostaglandin E2 plasma levels until, after five stimulations, neither prostaglandin was detectable. The maximum detected concentration of norepinephrine did not significantly change, but its area under the curve in time showed a trend toward an increase. Epinephrine levels did not significantly change. The increase of vascular resistance was significantly correlated with the decrease of both prostaglandins (r = 0.93, p less than 0.05 for prostaglandin E2 and r = 0.89, p less than 0.05 for 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha), whereas no significant correlations were found between variations of vascular resistance and catecholamines. Prostaglandin blockade induced by diclofenac sodium administration caused, from the first cold application, a pattern of the vasoconstrictor response and plasma prostaglandin and norepinephrine changes similar to that observed at the fifth cold application in untreated subjects, when prostaglandins are no longer detectable in plasma. We conclude that an increased vasoconstrictor response to sympathetic stimulation in humans may result from a diminished inhibitory influence of prostaglandins on adrenergic transmission.\r"

We measured coronary sinus and arterial plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) concentrations and blood flow to each part of the heart using the radioactive microsphere technique. Before acute volume expansion, the arterial-coronary sinus ANF difference was 305 +/- 23 pg/ml and rose to 1,009 +/- 220 pg/ml during volume expansion, whereas total coronary blood flow rose from 167 to 465 ml/min. Atrial blood flow rose from 2.9% to 4.6% of total coronary blood flow during volume expansion. ANF secretion rate increased from 51 to 469 ng/min. When divided by atrial weight, ANF secretion rate increased from 4.0 +/- 0.3 to 56 +/- 12 ng/min/g atrial tissue-in other words, from 0.3% to 3.7% of tissue ANF content each minute. Dividing by atrial blood flow indicated that the concentration of ANF leaving atrial tissue was 10,000 to 29,651 pg/ml, and the additional secretion of ANF was determined by the increase in coronary blood flow. Therefore, at least two mechanisms are responsible for altering coronary sinus ANF and circulating ANF: the release rate from atrial myocytes and the washout via changes in atrial blood flow.\r"

Respiratory acidosis (pH 7.09, Pco2 92 mm Hg) reduced contractility by a decrease in Emax (11.4 to 9.2 mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.01) with no change in V0. Despite this, cardiac output increased (1.7 to 2.1 l/min, p less than 0.01), and heart rate increased (96 to 121 beats/min, p less than 0.05), with no change in blood pressure. Systemic vascular resistance fell by 26% (p less than 0.01). During eucapnia, propranolol reduced Emax (11.4 to 4.6 mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.01) with no change in V0. After propranolol treatment, respiratory acidosis further reduced Emax (4.6 to 3.6 mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.05) and increased end-systolic volume more than before propranolol (p less than 0.001). Now cardiac output did not increase even though heart rate increased (81 to 106 beats/min, p less than 0.001) and systemic vascular resistance fell by 20% (p less than 0.01). We conclude that the effect of respiratory acidosis on the circulation is to increase venous return (equals cardiac output) in the face of decreased left ventricular contractility. The beta-adrenergic response to respiratory acidosis substantially ameliorated the increase in end-systolic volume and supported the increase in venous return but did not alter the associated tachycardia or vasodilation. Respiratory acidosis, like propranolol treatment, decreases contractility by decreasing Emax.\r"

  ".W": "Structural disruption of the cytoskeleton may be involved in irreversible ischemic injury. In the present study, ischemic changes in microtubules during various periods of myocardial ischemia were studied with an immunohistochemical technique in open-chest dogs. In intact myocardium, microtubules were stained as a filamentous network throughout cytoplasm and a circular network around the nucleus, which disappeared with colchicine treatment. In brief ischemia of less than 15 minutes, microtubule patterns were unaltered. After 20 minutes, however, characteristic microtubule stains were partly lost in patchy lesions. As an increase in ischemic period, lesions of loss of microtubule stains were increased in number and size. After 120 minutes of reperfusion following 60 minutes of ischemia, the lesions with intact actin filaments but with disrupted microtubules were replaced by the severely injured cells in which the regular myofibrillar registrations were distinctly disrupted. After 24 hours of reperfusion following 40 minutes of occlusion of the left circumflex artery, the percent area of disrupted microtubules at 40 minutes of ischemia was replaced by that of irreversibly injured lesions in the posterior papillary muscle. These results indicate that disruption of microtubules during ischemia heralds irreversible ischemic injury. However, in in vitro study, the myocardium incubated in hypoxic solution for 60-120 minutes demonstrated earlier disruption of the microtubules than the vinculin. Electron microscopic study also showed minimal irreversible changes in the lesions with disrupted microtubules. Thus, taken together, we conclude that microtubules that support the structural integration of myofibrils and other organelles are disrupted in severe myocardial ischemia before the irreversible injury, promoting the irreversible change after reperfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The renin response to hypoxia in late gestation fetal sheep has been well characterized. However, the renin response to asphyxia--the combination of hypoxia and hypercapnia--has not been extensively studied. The purpose of this study was to determine 1) the interaction of hypoxia and hypercapnia in the control of renin secretion in late gestation fetal sheep and 2) the role of peripheral arterial chemoreceptors therein. Chronically catheterized fetal sheep (intact or sinoaortic denervated) were exposed to hypoxia and/or hypercapnia for 30 minutes. Hypercapnia alone had no effect on plasma renin activity or aldosterone but did result in a significant increase in angiotensin II. Hypercapnia combined with hypoxia resulted in a significant increase in renin activity, angiotensin II, and aldosterone. Sinoaortic denervation attenuated the renin and angiotensin II responses to hypercapnia plus hypoxia. The increase in renin and angiotensin II in response to hypercapnia with or without concomitant hypoxia strongly correlated with the magnitude of the decrease in arterial pH in intact fetuses only. Hypoxia alone and in concert with hypercapnia increased mean arterial pressure and decreased heart rate in intact but not sinoaortic denervated fetuses. We conclude that 1) hypercapnia more potently increases plasma renin activity than does hypoxia in late gestation fetal sheep, 2) arterial pH may be the relevant signal perceived by the peripheral arterial chemoreceptors for the control of the renin-angiotensin system during asphyxia, and 3) the cardiovascular response to hypoxia is mediated, in part, by peripheral arterial chemoreceptors.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) appear to act as functional antagonists in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and blood pressure. To further define the relations between these hormones in vivo, we investigated the effect of low doses of Ang II (1-10 ng/kg/min) on plasma ANF levels. We also evaluated the influence of ANF release on the renal and hormonal responses to ANG II. Studies were performed in anesthetized and conscious instrumented dogs during sustained saline load and converting enzyme inhibition. In the anesthetized dogs, Ang II significantly increased plasma ANF levels and ANF arteriovenous difference without changing either atrial pressures or hematocrit. In both conscious and anesthetized dogs, ANF increases were not correlated with blood pressure responses to Ang II and did not occur in control groups when Ang II was replaced by vehicle. Ang II-induced sodium retention and stimulation of aldosterone production were attenuated, and renin suppression was enhanced in dogs having the largest changes in plasma ANF in response to converting enzyme inhibition or Ang II. These results demonstrate that in volume-replete dogs Ang II can promote ANF release independently of changes in atrial pressures or systemic hemodynamics, suggesting that Ang II may exert a significant modulatory effect on ANF secretion. The results also show significant relations between ANF and renal and adrenal responses to Ang II, which may suggest that, in turn, endogenous ANF modulates the effects of Ang II.\r"

Moreover, CA-125 serum levels did not correlate with the increasing values of the plasma E2 or ovarian volume.

Serum testosterone and hair growth rate declined in patients while on 600 to 1,000 mg ketoconazole daily. Menses normalized in seven of eight subjects during treatment. Ketoconazole therapy was not associated with a change in basal or postgonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation gonadotropin levels. Basal cortisol levels were also unchanged on ketoconazole though responsiveness of cortisol to adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation tended to be reduced. We conclude that ketoconazole can effectively reverse the biochemical and clinical abnormalities of ovarian hyperandrogenism. Until the issue of its safety is resolved, ketoconazole therapy is best limited to select individuals who agree to careful monitoring and the use of reliable birth control methods during treatment.\r"

Prostaglandin I2 and PGD2 stimulated cAMP production in the CL of both the menstrual cycle and early pregnancy. This stimulatory effect was maximal for PGI2 after 5 minutes and for PGD2 after 10 minutes. Repeated addition of the PGs during 120 minutes in the CL from the menstrual cycle resulted in a persistent cAMP elevation and stimulated P formation. The stimulatory effects of PGI2 and PGD2 on cAMP and P production in vitro indicate that these local hormones play a role in the normal development of human menstrual CL and in the persistence of the CL of early pregnancy.\r"

The analysis of 466 CC-hMG and 319 buserelin acetate-hMG trials shows that buserelin acetate-hMG stimulation generates a greater ovarian response resulting in higher numbers of oocytes being retrieved (6.2 + 3.8 versus 9.3 + 5.2) and fertilized (2.8 + 2.7 versus 4.3 + 3.8). More embryos are thus obtained, allowing a wider choice for intrauterine replacement and cryopreservation. Mean embryonic vitality scores do not differ (4.33 + 1.51 versus 4.44 + 1.54), implying that the embryonic quality remains similar in both treatments. A premature demise of the corpus luteum occurs in a large proportion of buserelin acetate-hMG cycles. However, when suppletive progesterone treatment is given, there is a trend toward a better implantation rate per embryo, and a significantly higher ongoing pregnancy rate is observed in relation to buserelin acetate-hMG treatment (20%) as compared with CC-hMG cycles (14%).\r"

However, there was no significant difference in improvement between parenteral versus enteral groups as assessed by the CDAI. Changes in nutritional assessment parameters, including retinol binding protein, nitrogen balance, total lymphocyte count, and transferrin, were related to the quantity of calories consumed rather than the mode of delivery.

  ".W": "To examine in greater detail the relationship between DNP-specific/class I MHC-restricted suppressor molecules (SSF) that inhibit contact sensitivity to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene and the receptors on the T cells that produce them, we have generated two T cell hybridomas that can be induced to produce and secrete these molecules. In order to become activated to produce SSF, the Ts 15.15 and 15.31 cells required recognition of complexes of DNP/Dd on presenting cells. The suppressor molecules produced by each of the Ts hybrids had the same specificity, recognizing DNP/Dd on cells in the immune lymph node cell target population. The activation of the Ts hybrids was blocked when the cells were treated with the anti-V beta 8 antibody F23.1 before coculture with the DNP-presenting cells. Reduction of the 15.15 and 15.31 SSF followed by affinity chromatography on DNP-bovine-gamma-globulin-Sepharose beads indicated that these molecules are dimers and that one of the chains (Ag-binding(AgB] binds to cellfree DNP and one (non-Ag-binding (NAgB) chain) does not. The AgB chain was found to express an epitope bound by a mAb specific for a TCR alpha-chain-constant region determinant. Alternatively, the NAgB chain expressed an epitope bound by the anti-V beta 8 mAb F23.1. Active hybrid suppressor molecules were generated by combining the NAgB chain from a DNP-specific/H-2Kd-restricted SSF (produced by Ts hybridoma 3-10) with the AgB chain from Ts 15.31 and by combining the NAgB chain from Ts cell 15.15 with the 3-10 AgB chain. In each case, the class I MHC element (i.e., Kd or Dd) restricting the activity of these hybrid SSF correlated with the source of the V beta 8+, NAgB chain. Thus, these secreted immunoregulatory molecules have the Ag/MHC specificity of the T cells producing them and are structurally and serologically related to the TCR-alpha/beta. The results further suggest that for some hapten-specific/class I MHC-restricted TCR, the alpha-chain may have avidity for the hapten and the beta-chain may dictate the MHC restriction element (K or D) recognized by the receptor.\r"

  ".U": "90375890\r", 
  ".W": "The murine intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) population is enriched in T cells that express the gamma delta-TCR, however, the biologic function served by these T cells remains obscure. IEL are considered to be major effector cells in mucosal immunity, and we have investigated whether IEL subsets could reverse orally induced systemic unresponsiveness (oral tolerance; OT) and support secondary type responses when adoptively transferred to mice orally tolerized with SRBC. When purified CD3+ IEL from mice orally primed with SRBC were transferred to adoptive hosts and challenged with SRBC, splenic IgM, IgG1, IgG2b, and IgA anti-SRBC plaque-forming cell responses were observed. However, CD3+ IEL from HRBC orally primed mice did not abrogate SRBC induced OT. Further, HRBC-primed CD3+, IEL converted HRBC-specific OT but not SRBC-specific OT. CD3+ IEL could be separated into four subsets based on expression of CD4 and CD8. CD3+, CD4-, 8+ T cells were the major subset (74.5%), with smaller numbers of CD4- and CD8- (double negatives, DN) (7.8%), CD4+, 8- (7.6%) and CD4+, CD8+ (double positives) (10.1%) T cells. Interestingly, both the CD3+, CD8+, and the CD3+, DN IEL subsets abrogated OT, resulting in significant IgM, IgG1, IgG2b, and IgA anti-SRBC plaque-forming cell responses when adoptively transferred to mice with OT. However, neither CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, nor double positive T cells affected OT when studied in this system. The CD3+, CD8+ IEL subset could be further separated into Thy-1+ (16.6%) and Thy-1- (83.4%) cells; adoptive transfer of Thy-1- cells abrogated oral tolerance whereas the Thy-1+ subset was without effect. When the expression of TCR on IEL with this biologic function was determined by use of monoclonal anti-alpha beta TCR (H57.597), TCR2-, CD3+ IEL possessed immunoregulatory function whereas the alpha beta-TCR+ (TCR2+) fraction did not abrogate OT. Immunoprecipitation of membrane fractions obtained from purified CD3+, CD4-, CD8+, Thy-1- IEL with polyclonal anti-delta peptide (Tyr-Ala-Asn-Ser-Phe-Asn-Asn-Glu-Lys-Leu) antibody revealed bands of 45 and 35 kDa, corresponding to the delta- and gamma-chains, respectively. These results suggest that gamma delta-TCR+ IEL possess a regulatory function, namely the restoration of immune responses in a state of oral tolerance. Further, both CD3+, CD4-, CD8+, Thy-1-, and CD3+, DN IEL T cells exhibit this effector contrasuppressor function.\r"

  ".W": "Two splenic cell clones were derived from mice bearing UV-induced skin tumors; both clones are I-J+, Thy-1+, and J11D+. Cellular extracts, but not culture supernatants, from the two clones, designated T4 and T5, specifically suppress primary cytotoxic and proliferative responses to UV-induced tumor targets. Therefore, clones T4 and T5 would appear to function as putative I-J+ suppressor cells with specificity for an antigenic epitope common to several UV-induced tumors. To derive more information concerning the status of Ag-receptor genes in the suppressive clones, we analyzed the rearrangement and expression of Ig and TCR genes. The first clone, T4, expressed Thy-1, a T cell-surface marker, yet it had not rearranged its TCR-beta, -gamma, and -delta gene families, nor were TCR-alpha, -beta, -gamma, or -delta transcripts detectable. Instead, clone T4 contained rearranged Ig H chain genes and expressed mu RNA. Because neither lambda nor kappa L chain transcripts were detected, this clone could not utilize a complete Ig molecule as its Ag receptor. On the other hand, clone T5 contained exclusively TCR gene rearrangements; it expressed alpha and beta transcripts of the correct sizes. However, the level of RNA that could encode the delta-chain of the CD3 accessory molecule was below detection, so it is unlikely that this TCR was expressed on the cell surface. The rearrangement of Ig genes in one clone and TCR genes in the other clone does not necessarily indicate that these genes encode the Ag receptors used by these clones. However, it suggests either that suppressor-like cells can derive from different lymphocyte precursor lineages or that rearrangements of the known TCR genes or the Ig genes are irrelevant to the function of this cell lineage.\r"

CD4-CD8-Thy-1.2+ (double negative or DN) T cells from the diseased mice, however, displayed an abundance of type l K+ channels compared to DN T cells in normal mice, or mice immunized with CFA. Furthermore, the aberrant expression of type l K+ channels correlated with the presence of active disease. DN T cells from mice with SLE, type-1 diabetes mellitus, and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, also exhibited a high number of type l K+ channels. These results suggest that expression of numerous type l K+ channels may be a useful marker for DN T cells associated with these autoimmune disorders.\r"

  ".U": "90375904\r", 
  ".W": "In this study two new in vitro effects of IFN-gamma on human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells were described. First, it was shown that the expression of the adhesion molecule ELAM-1 on activated HUVE cells can be modulated by IFN-gamma. ELAM-1 is normally not expressed by HUVE cells, but its expression can rapidly be induced by TNF, IL-1, or LPS. Maximal expression is reached after 4 to 6 h of activation, and after 24 h the expression disappeared. Whereas IFN-gamma per se did not induce expression of ELAM-1, it enhanced and prolonged the expression of ELAM-1. This enhancement occurred when IFN-gamma was added before activation as well as when added simultaneously with activation. When IFN-gamma was added 6 or 9 h after the activation, the normally ongoing reduction of expression was not only retarded, but the expression increased for at least 3 h. Moreover, IFN-gamma abrogated the refractory period for restimulation. Neither IFN-beta nor IL-6 had any effect on the expression of ELAM-1. The second effect of IFN-gamma on HUVE cells is the capacity to enhance the IL-6 production by these cells. Prestimulation as well as coincubation of IFN-gamma with TNF, IL-1, or LPS resulted in a strongly augmented production of IL-6. The effects of IFN-gamma may in vivo play a role in the regulation of an inflammatory reaction, because ELAM-1 is an adhesion molecule for neutrophils, and IL-6 has an enhancing effect on the cytotoxicity of neutrophils.\r"

  ".W": "Upon weekly i.m. injections of disodium gold thiomalate (Na2AuTM) 100% of A.SW mice produced IgG autoantibodies to antinuclear Ag and nucleolar Ag, respectively; about 70% of C57BL/6 mice produced IgG antinuclear Ag, whereas DBA/2 mice were resistant. Moreover, C57BL/6 mice, but not DBA/2 mice, showed increased mesangial deposits of IgG. These alterations were due not to disodium thiomalate, but to the gold ion of Na2AuTM. An assumed T cell reactivity of susceptible mouse strains to Na2AuTM was tested by means of the direct popliteal lymph node (PLN) assay. However, no distinct PLN reaction to Na2AuTM was detectable. Likewise, AuCl did not induce a PLN reaction. Both Na2AuTM and AuCl contain gold in the Au(I) state. The poor PLN responses to Au(I) contrasted with the strong PLN responses to Au(III) compounds. PLN reactions to Au(III) were dose dependent, T cell dependent, and specific. When Au(III) was reduced to Au(I) by addition of Na2TM or methionine before testing in the PLN assay its sensitizing capacity was significantly decreased. Thus, the oxidation state of gold, i.e., Au(III) vs Au(I), plays a major role for its sensitizing capacity. Therefore, we propose that the Au(I) of Na2AuTM is oxidized to Au(III) before T cells are sensitized and adverse immunologic reactions develop. Results obtained with the adoptive transfer PLN assay indicated that, indeed, repeated i.m. injections of Na2AuTM sensitized A.SW and C57BL/6 splenic T cells to Au(III).\r"

  ".W": "Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a lung disorder characterized by an exaggerated accumulation of CD8+ T lymphocytes in the pulmonary parenchyma. To investigate the mechanisms accounting for the T cell alveolitis taking place in the lung of HP patients and their pattern of growth, cells recovered from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of seven patients were evaluated for: 1) the expression of activation markers, including IL-2R (p55 and p75 subunits), HLA-DR and VLA-1 Ag; 2) the ability of IL-2 and IL-4 to induce in vitro proliferation; 3) the capability to synthesize and release IL-2 by determining the levels of IL-2 in BAL cell-free supernatants and by evaluating the presence of mRNA transcripts for IL-2; and 4) the molecular configuration of the beta- and gamma-genes of the TCR. This study demonstrates that a high number of BAL lymphocytes recovered from the lungs of HP patients express activation markers including the p75 chain of IL-2R, VLA-1, and HLA-DR Ag. These cells express the CD3+,CD8+,CD16-,CD56+ phenotype and proliferate in vitro in the presence of IL-2 but do not release this cytokine. Furthermore, IL-2 transcripts could not be detected in BAL resting T lymphocytes. No proliferation was observed in the presence of IL-4. The analysis of the configuration of the TCR beta- and gamma-genes showed a polyclonal pattern, with the exception of one case in which extra bands were observed following digestion with BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes. Taken together, our data suggest that the IL-2 system may play a central role in the mechanisms accounting for lymphocytic alveolitis in HP patients. Although the pattern of growth is usually polyclonal, such polyclonal recruitment seems to be biased toward cells that have rearranged and possibly expressed particular V beta or V gamma genes, thus leading to the hypothesis that the events that take place in the lung of these patients may occasionally elicit an oligoclonal expansion of the cells proliferating in lung parenchyma.\r"

The objective of these experiments was to evaluate the effects of differentiation for 1 or 6 days in IFN-gamma, 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D3, granulocyte-macrophage CSF, or in various combinations of these agents on both steady state IL-1 beta mRNA levels and protein production in LPS-stimulated monocytes. Monocytes preincubated in IFN-gamma for 1 day, then cultured for 24 h with LPS, exhibited similar kinetics of IL-1 beta mRNA production, but a higher peak mRNA level at 8 h after LPS stimulation, in comparison with cells cultured in medium before LPS stimulation. An increase in IL-1 beta protein production with variable secretion was noted in monocytes preincubated in IFN-gamma before stimulation with LPS. Monocytes preincubated for 1 day in 1,25-(OH)2-D3 alone or in both IFN-gamma and 1,25-(OH)2-D3 exhibited similar kinetics and peak expression of LPS-induced IL-1 beta mRNA levels as cells cultured in medium. However, monocytes preincubated for 1 day in both agents displayed a 50% or greater restoration in LPS-induced IL-1 beta synthesis and secretion in comparison with fresh cells. Granulocyte-macrophage-CSF did not augment the effects of the other differentiating agents on IL-1 beta production. Monocytes cultured over 6 days in differentiating agents failed to exhibit any restoration in LPS-induced IL-1 beta production. These in vitro-derived macrophages exhibited very low levels of both IL-1 beta mRNA and protein production under any culture condition. These results suggest that the effects of differentiating agents on LPS-induced IL-1 beta production may in part be related to the state of maturation of the monocyte. Furthermore, a repression in IL-1 beta transcription that is not reversed by exposure to differentiating agents may be acquired by monocytes as they mature into macrophages in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphokine secretion by in vivo-activated T cells was analyzed at the population and single-cell levels in lymphocytes from mice undergoing an acute allogeneic graft-vs-host reaction (GVHR). Three observations were made. First, constitutive lymphokine production by these cells was very low but could be dramatically up-regulated by TCR ligation. Thus, even when harvested at the peak of the GVHR, fewer than 0.1% of lymphocytes secreted detectable granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, IFN-gamma, or IL-3 in the first 24 h in vitro, and average production of these lymphokines in bulk cultures was less than 10(-5) U/cell. However, when cultured for 24 h with anti-CD3 antibody under conditions which activated less than 0.1% of normal cells, about 30% of GVHR T cells secreted GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, and/or IL-3, and average production levels were increased by 10(3)- to 10(4)-fold. Together with evidence that host alloantigen-induced lymphokine secretion was 10 to 100 times lower than the anti-CD3 response, these data suggest that physiologic lymphokine synthesis by most T cells is low (less than 10(-18) mol of IL-3 per cell) but can be raised above the threshold of detection by TCR cross-linking. Second, individual GVHR lymphocytes varied markedly in their total and relative production of different lymphokines in response to anti-CD3 stimulation, with some cells secreting IL-3 alone, some secreting IL-3 accompanied by other lymphokines (GM-CSF and/or IFN-gamma), and some secreting other lymphokines without detectable IL-3. Finally, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from GVHR mice responded to anti-CD3 antibody by secreting IL-3 and other lymphokines: purified CD4+ cells contained an average of 16% and CD8+ cells an average of 10% anti-CD3-inducible lymphokine-secreting cells. By contrast, only 2 to 3% of cells of either subset formed clones in cultures with host allogeneic cells and IL-2, suggesting that clonogenic alloreactive cells were a minority of the T cells activated in the GVHR.\r"

Untreated mice and mice receiving control antibody had low or undetectable amounts of mRNA for c-fos, c-myc, IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma. After injection of anti-CD3 antibody, substantial increases in all were found. Induction of c-fos was detected at 10 min and of c-myc at 30 min after injection. IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma mRNA were induced by 30 min and reached peak levels at 60 min. Thereafter, IL-2 and IL-4 mRNA declined, whereas IFN-gamma mRNA persisted. The induced cytokine mRNA was not observed in athymic nu/nu mice nor in normal spleen cells from which T cells had been depleted in vitro. The early in vivo induction of IL-4 mRNA contrasts with prior in vitro studies in which IL-4 production was difficult to detect after primary stimulation. To assess the possibility that many T cells had been preprimed in vivo, germfree mice were compared with conventional mice and no differences in cytokine mRNA were found. These data show that T cell-dependent IL message production can be induced rapidly in vivo without prepriming and that the cytokine messages induced after anti-CD3 antibody administration do not suggest a predominance of either Th1 or Th2 type cells.\r"

  ".U": "90375915\r", 
  ".W": "Activation of T lymphocytes leads to the production of the T cell growth factor IL-2 that regulates T cell proliferation. This activation is associated with several potential intracellular signalling events including increased activity of phospholipase C (PLC) and resultant increases in production of inositol phosphates and diacylglycerols. In addition, phosphorylation of specific intracellular proteins on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues increases. The role of each of these events in IL-2 production is unclear. Using Western blotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies, we demonstrate that activation of murine T cells with mitogenic lectins or anti-CD3 antibodies leads to a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 120, 72, 62, 55, and 40 kDa. Similar patterns of antiphosphotyrosine antibodies reactivity were observed in splenocytes, a T cell hybridoma, and a T lymphoma. Tyrosine phosphorylation was detectable within minutes of addition of mitogenic lectins and persisted for at least 6 h. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin did not inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation indicating that a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein is not involved in signal transduction. Neither increasing cytosolic-free calcium nor activating protein kinase C mimicked the effects of mitogenic lectins suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation was not a consequence of activation of PLC. This was confirmed by demonstrating that mitogenic lectins induced similar patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation in cells in which activation of the TCR leads to increased PLC activity and in cells in which PLC is not stimulated. To test whether tyrosine phosphorylation is linked to IL-2 secretion, we determined the effect of three specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tyrphostins) on tyrosine phosphorylation, IL-2 secretion, and cellular proliferation. The concentration dependence of inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation and IL-2 production were similar. However, higher concentrations of the tyrphostins were required to inhibit constitutive proliferation of the T cell line indicating that inhibition of IL-2 secretion was not secondary to nonspecific toxic effects of the tyrphostins. Addition of the tyrphostins after mitogenic lectin decreased the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation and IL-2 secretion in parallel. This indicates that both tyrosine kinases and phosphatases are activated and that continuous tyrosine phosphorylation is likely required for IL-2 secretion. Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation appears to represent an obligatory event in the transmembrane signaling processes that lead to IL-2 secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet activating factor (PAF) and the active cleavage product of the fifth component of complement, C5a, are potent anaphylotoxins and mediators of inflammation. Both substances engage distinct guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein-coupled receptors on a variety of cell types, thereby activating a signaling cascade that results in the mobilization of intracellular calcium stores, and in functional responses such as neutrophil chemotaxis and smooth muscle contraction. Little is known about the structure of PAF and C5a receptors or about the intracellular signaling pathways used by them. We have used the Xenopus oocyte expression system to demonstrate acquired C5a and PAF receptor activity in oocytes injected with mRNA from the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 differentiated with dibutyryl cAMP. Activity was determined by measuring acquired ligand-dependent efflux of intracellular 45Ca2+ and by measuring ligand-activated transmembrane currents in voltage clamped oocytes. C5a receptor activity was confined to a single sharp peak in sucrose gradient fractionated RNA that corresponded to a transcript size of 2 kb. In contrast, PAF receptor activity was broadly distributed in size fractionated RNA from 3.5 to 6 kb. This suggests that multiple transcripts of different sizes may encode a functional PAF receptor. Both ligands activated their respective receptor in a concentration-dependent and a structure-dependent manner. The acquired C5a-dependent calcium efflux activity was inhibited by pertussis toxin whereas the PAF receptor activity was not, suggesting that the two receptors couple to different G-proteins. These data establish the Xenopus oocyte as a model system for studying the molecular and functional properties of the C5a receptor and the PAF receptor(s) of phagocytic cells.\r"

  ".W": "Our study has examined platelet-activating factor (PAF) biosynthesis in neutrophils from individuals on a fish oil-enriched diet and in mast cells enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in vitro. Neutrophils isolated from males who were fed fish oil supplement (EPA; 2.8 g/day) for 5 wk contained large quantities of eicosapentaenoate in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine and less in phosphatidylinositol. The ratio arachidonate/eicosapentaenoate in PC and phosphatidylethanolamine decreased from greater than 10 before the enriched diet to approximately 3 after the diet. The putative precursor of PAF, 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-GPC) contained the bulk of eicosapentaenoate in PC subclasses with smaller quantities found in 1-acyl and 1-alk-1'-enyl linked species. Ionophore A23187-stimulated neutrophils produced similar quantities of PAF before and after enriched diet. Neutrophils during normal diet acylated 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-GPC only with arachidonate whereas neutrophils from individuals on enriched diet transferred both arachidonate and eicosapentaenoate into exogenously-provided 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-GPC. This allowed for the labeling of neutrophils with 1-O-[3H]-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC (before diet) as well as neutrophils with 1-O-[3H]-alkyl-2-eicosapentaenoyl-GPC and 1-O-[3H]-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC (after diet). Neutrophils after diet converted similar quantities of these labeled precursors to labeled PAF upon stimulation as those before the diet. Analysis of the nature of the long chain acyl residue remaining in the sn-2 position of 1-alkyl-2-acyl-GPC after cell stimulation indicated that arachidonate and eicosapentaenoate were both released from 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-GPC at comparable rates. Finally, in vitro supplementation of murine mast cells (PT-18) with arachidonic acid or EPA caused a marked increase in the amount of PAF produced by the cell without having any effect on histamine release. Data from these experiments suggest that EPA is incorporated into a PAF precursor pool. However, this appears not to inhibit PAF production because phospholipase A2 can use eicosapentaenoate- as well as arachidonate-containing phospholipids in the initial step of PAF biosynthesis.\r"

Whether the production of these autoantibodies in mev mouse results from polyclonal nonspecific B cell activation or specific Ag-driven stimulation is not known. To understand the mechanisms involved in the induction of antithymocyte autoantibody response in mev mouse, we have studied the fine antigenic specificity, structure, and origin of three antithymocyte autoantibodies derived from mev splenic B cell hybridomas. Western blot analysis showed that these mAb bind to polypeptides of 33 and 105 kDa present in RBC and thymocytes, respectively. Additional specificities for the epitopes present in other polypeptides distinguished these three autoantibodies. Northern hybridization and flow microfluorimetry analysis indicated that these hybridomas are derived from the Ly1+ B cell subset. These autoreactive Ly-1 B cell hybridomas, chosen on the basis of their specificity, expressed L chain V genes from a single VK family (VK9) and VH genes from J606 and S107 families. Hybridomas UN34.11 and UN42.5 expressed the VK9 gene identical to that used by peritoneal Ly1+ B cells from various mouse strains and malignant B lymphoma cells secreting anti-mouse RBC treated with proteolytic enzyme bromelin and anti-SRBC antibodies. The third hybridoma, S2-14.2, used a VK9 gene identical to that expressed by MOPC41. None of the VK genes encoding these autoantibodies showed any somatic mutations. In the case of VH genes, the two hybridomas UN42.5 and S2-14.2 derived from two separate fusions, used identical VH genes from the J606 family. The third hybridoma UN34.11 used unmutated V11 germline VH gene, a member of the S107 family. Southern hybridizations, using oligonucleotide probes specific for CDR1 and CDR2, showed that the VH genes encoding the J606 autoantibodies were derived from a germline gene found in the 6.7-kb fragment of EcoRI-digested germline DNA. This germline VH gene is distinct from VH22.1 germline gene that codes for antigalactan antibodies. Sequence analysis of this gene showed perfect homology with the rearranged VH genes confirming the lack of somatic mutations. Thus, our data demonstrate that antithymocyte antibody response occurring in mev mouse is polyclonal and it involves Ly-1 B cells expressing unmutated germline VH and VK genes. These results indicate that antigen driven stimulation may not play an important role in the induction of anti-thymocyte antibody response in mev mouse.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 50% of the primary antibody response of BALB/c mice to the A/PR/8/34 influenza virus hemagglutinin is directed to the Cb site, one of the four major antigenic regions of the molecule. To determine the structural basis of the anti-Cb site response, we have examined the paratypic and genetic diversity exhibited by a panel of 24 primary and 4 secondary response mAb specific for this antigenic region. Reactivity pattern analysis demonstrated 20 distinct fine specificities among these antibodies, and V region gene sequence analysis showed that they are encoded by 17 different VH gene segments from 6 VH gene families and 14 different VK gene segments from 6 VK gene groups. Despite this overall diversity, many of the antibodies can be placed in a limited number of sets based on the shared expression of VH and/or VK genes. One set contains antibodies encoded by a single gene of the VK4/5 group in combination with one of two closely related genes from the J558 VH family. This set accounts for half of the Cb site-specific primary response hybridomas, indicating that the representation of the various anti-Cb site B cell specificities during the primary response to A/PR/8/34 influenza virus is not uniform. The preferential participation of B cells expressing this VH/VK combination is largely responsible for the dominance of anti-Cb site antibodies in the primary anti-hemagglutinin response.\r"

Experiments directed toward the analysis of serum antibody and the cell populations that combine to generate antibody in autoimmune mice have led to the proposition that autoantibody production, including anti-DNA, results from the nonselective, polyclonal activation of B cells. The present results from the molecular analyses of anti-DNA autoantibodies from an individual (NZB x NZW)F1 autoimmune mouse, however, are inconsistent with a clonally nonselective model for autoantibody production and are most consistent with a clonally selective, Ag-driven model for anti-DNA autoantibody production. These results demonstrate that Ig V region structures contributed by germ-line V region genes; recombinational diversity, including unusual DH gene usage and DH-DH recombination; and somatic mutation during B cell clonal expansion are all important for generating antibody and presumably B cell Ig receptor specificity for nucleic acids including native, duplex DNA.\r"

  ".W": "A group of coordinately induced protooncogenes, cytoskeletal, and extracellular matrix genes have been termed immediate early response genes, and their induction has been associated with growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation. We have investigated the induction of these genes by macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) in human monocytes that do not proliferate in response to M-CSF but require the factor for optimal cell differentiation. Normal human monocytes were isolated, carefully washed, and incubated for 36 to 48 h in fetal bovine serum-containing medium. At the end of this incubation the resting cells were stimulated with M-CSF, and RNA was isolated for analysis by Northern blotting. RNA from control resting cells contained low to undetectable levels of c-jun, fibronectin receptor, and actin mRNA. Within 15 to 30 min of addition of M-CSF, however, there was a dramatic coordinate induction of these genes. The c-jun gene expression was very transient and was not detectable by 60 min after M-CSF addition. In contrast, the expression of actin and fibronectin receptor mRNA was more sustained, and the expression of these genes remained elevated at 24 to 48 h after M-CSF addition. We also observed the induction of the myelomonocytic specific tyrosine kinase hck gene simultaneously with the other immediate early response genes. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not block the induction of any of these genes, and in fact, super-induced the expression of c-jun and hck. Nuclear run on transcription of the c-jun, hck, and actin genes. Therefore, in normal human monocytes M-CSF induces immediate early response genes without inducing cell proliferation. These genes may then play a role in altering the physiologic status of the cells in response to CSF.\r"

  ".W": "A cluster of four consecutive CDR2 somatic mutations are shared by the VH regions of two independently isolated hybridoma antibodies with specificity for p-azophenylarsonate (Ars). The mutations appear to be derived by a series of independent events. To assess the influence of these shared somatic mutations on antibody affinity for Ars and on idiotypy, we introduced them, via site-directed mutagenesis, into the V region of an anti-Ars antibody that was otherwise unmutated and we eliminated them from the mutated context of one of the two antibodies in which they were originally found. Results of affinity measurements by fluorescence quenching and of idiotypic binding assays performed on these engineered mutants demonstrated that the shared mutations increased affinity for Ars and eliminated the predominant Id associated with strain A anti-Ars antibodies and four of five idiotypes defined by anti-idiotypic mAb. These results support the interpretation that a strong affinity-based selection pressure has favored the clonal expansion of B cells with receptors containing these mutations despite the loss of a predominant Id. Thus, in producing antibodies containing V regions conferring high affinity for Ag, the combined processes of somatic mutation and clonal selection have generated a common structural solution through parallel repeats.\r"

Gene probes spanning the distance from 5' to 3' regions of the J alpha locus were used to determine the approximate location of gene rearrangements within hybridomas representing each of the early thymocyte populations. The predominant location of rearrangements was within the 5' region of the J alpha locus. Among the several cells in which rearrangements were found on only one chromosome, the one rearrangements was always in the 5' region. When two rearrangements were found, the rearrangements on homologous chromosomes were usually in the same region. The overall pattern among thymocytes was in great contrast to that previously observed among hybridomas derived from stimulated adult spleen cells within which rearrangements fell mostly to the 3' side of the alpha-locus. Results reveal the nonrandom nature of the TCR-alpha gene rearrangement event and may reflect an incidence of multiple V-J alpha joining events on each chromosome during T cell development in vivo. Due to the fact that most mature cells bear two J alpha joins, the allelic exclusion of alpha-chains cannot be explained by a mechanism whereby a functional rearrangement on one chromosome inhibits subsequent rearrangement on the second. Instead allelic exclusion may rely on a low frequency of productive vs nonproductive rearrangement events and an incompatibility between multiple alpha- and beta-protein pairs.\r"

In both systems, only the generation of cytotoxic response against the autologous melanoma cells were suppressed. Cytotoxic response against EBV-infected autologous lymphoblastoid cell line in one case and cytotoxic responses against allogeneic targets in the other were not affected. In addition to suppressor activity selectively expressed against the autologous melanoma cells, the T cell clones up-regulated their Tac receptors when cocultured with the autologous melanoma cells and APC.

There are significant differences in the flow velocity and CBF responses to hypercapnia, hypocapnia, and trimethaphan-induced hypotension which indicate that TCD cannot be considered a simple alternative to CBF measurement for the study of cerebrovascular reactivity and cerebral autoregulation.\r"

Hemoglobin concentration, tissue Cu levels and the activities of the Cu-dependent enzymes--ceruloplasmin, superoxide dismutase and cytochrome c oxidase--were markedly lowered by Cu-deficient diets and by homocysteine. These dietary treatments also lowered the activity of glutathione peroxidase and produced concomitant increases in the activity of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase and iron levels in the liver. However, dietary homocysteine decreased hepatic Mn and low Cu diets decreased cardiac iron content. Moreover, both dietary treatments significantly lowered kidney Fe levels. Homocysteine increased heart, liver and kidney weights (g/100 g body tissue) and greatly elevated the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in heart tissue. These results indicate that dietary homocysteine can markedly lower Cu status in rats and result in tissue redistribution of Fe and increased cardiac levels of TBARS, a measure of lipid peroxidation.\r"

The commercial formulations contained 1070 mg taurine/kg dry matter (by analysis). The excretion of 14C in CO2, urine and feces was monitored. Significant quantities of 14CO2 were produced, with greater amounts excreted by cats fed the heat-processed commercial diet (9.4% of initial dose) than by those fed the frozen-preserved diet (0.09%), indicating extensive taurine degradation by the intestinal microflora. Purified diet groups were intermediate between the two commercial diet groups. Carbon-14 excreted in urine peaked at 24 h and was highest for cats fed the frozen-preserved commercial diet or 1325 mg taurine/kg purified diet. Carbon-14 excreted in feces was highest for cats fed the two commercial diet formulations, with peak amounts at 48-72 h. Because the frozen-preserved commercial diet had previously been shown to maintain plasma taurine concentration, whereas the heat-processed diet did not, these results indicate that processing affects the digestive and/or absorptive process in a manner that increases the catabolism of taurine by gastrointestinal microorganisms.\r"

  ".W": "A multicenter study was undertaken to determine the sensitivity and reproducibility of markers for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral growth and the effect of various preparations of lymphocytes on the sensitivity of standard and routinely used procedures for HIV-1 isolation. In phase 1, cocultivated culture supernatants obtained from 10 HIV-1 cultures were transported to three Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) Virology Laboratories. Three commercial HIV-p24 antigen capture (AC) tests and two reverse transcriptase (RT) assays were used to ascertain the replication of HIV-1. The Du Pont and Abbott AC assays were found to be most sensitive (85-100%), and the RT assay with 24-h incubation period had comparable sensitivity (75-100%). In phase II, the sensitivity of standard cocultivation procedure for HIV-1 isolation was compared using freshly phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA-P)-stimulated, stimulated-frozen, and frozen-thawed and then stimulated normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as cocultivating cells. Blood samples from 13 HIV-1 infected individuals with various CD4+ cell counts were cocultivated in each of the three MACS laboratories using one of the aforementioned normal PBMCs. The PHA-P-stimulated fresh normal PBMC showed a maximum isolation rate of 100% (13 of 13) with an average of 8 days to positivity. This rate of isolation was significantly greater than other rates using any one of the other PBMC preparations. These findings demonstrated that the use of freshly PHA-P stimulated PBMCs maximized HIV-1 isolation from blood when a sensitive HIV-1 p24 AC assay or RT assay with overnight incubation is employed for the detection of HIV in culture supernatant.\r"

  ".W": "The long-term effect of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue-induced initial testosterone surge in the treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the prostate still is unknown. However, acute worsening of the disease has been reported in up to 10% of the patients. To prevent such tumor flare we investigated the endocrinological effects of different types of antiandrogens administered in addition to a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue. Patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer were pre-treated with either the steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate (6) or the nonsteroidal antiandrogen flutamide (5) for 1 week before the initial injection of the depot luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue Zoladex. In another 5 patients flutamide was first given 24 hours before Zoladex therapy was started. Luteinizing hormone, testosterone and prostatic acid phosphatase during month 1 of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue therapy were compared to data obtained in 5 patients treated by Zoladex alone. Only pre-treatment with cyproterone acetate was capable of preventing the Zoladex-induced testosterone surge. However, both pre-treatment regimens with either cyproterone acetate or flutamide for 1 week prevented an initial increase in prostatic acid phosphatase beyond pre-treatment levels in all patients. In contrast, in 4 of 5 patients treated with Zoladex alone and in 2 of 5 pre-treated with flutamide for 1 day an initial increase in prostatic acid phosphatase beyond the pre-treatment values was seen. Our data indicate that pre-treatment with flutamide for only 1 day may not be sufficient to prevent a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue-induced tumor flare in all cases.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) from vascular endothelium may play a key role in the genesis of atherosclerotic lesions. However, the ability of this tissue to synthesize LTB4 is controversial. To resolve this issue arachidonic acid metabolism was characterized in cultures of confluent monolayers of a rabbit aortic endothelial cell line by use of both high-pressure liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. Cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 with 5% fetal bovine serum. Lipoxygenase activity was studied by placing the cells in Hank's balanced salt solution with 2 mumol/L indomethacin. After 30 minutes preincubation with indomethacin cells were exposed to either arachidonic acid (10 mumol/L) or arachidonic acid labeled with radioactive carbon (14C) (1 microCi; SA 58 mCi/mmol) and then stimulated with 9.5 mumol/L calcium ionophore A23187 for 55 minutes. Studies of the cyclooxygenase activity were performed without preincubating with indomethacin. Samples were prepared for high-pressure liquid chromatography by evaporation to dryness under a vacuum and resuspending in 2 ml of 1:1 methanol/water. Tritium-labeled standards were added before loading the 14C-labeled samples on the column. Radiolabeled arachidonic acid metabolites were separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography and detected by means of a dual channel flow-through radiodetector that monitors both 14C and 3H. Based on coelution with authentic standards three lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid have been identified: LTB4, 12- and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraneoic acid. Leukotriene B4 was further characterized by ultraviolet spectral analysis and inhibition studies with use of nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Quantitation was facilitated by commercially available radioimmunoassay kits. An average of 600 pg LTB4/10(6) cells was measured from separate experiments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ventricular tachycardia was terminated by a drug in 35 of 105 trials. In 6 patients no drug terminated the arrhythmia. Adenosine did not terminate tachycardia or have any serious adverse effect in any patient; both flecainide and disopyramide were significantly more effective than lignocaine, but flecainide had significantly more severe adverse effects than lignocaine. Lignocaine was the safest drug and should continue to be used as first-line drug therapy for stable ventricular tachycardia. Disopyramide should be considered as second-line treatment. DC cardioversion is necessary for unstable ventricular tachycardia, and its availability must be ensured before attempted pharmacological intervention.\r"

  ".W": "Communicable diseases represent a considerable burden in terms of suffering and costs. The decision to develop a new vaccine varies with perspectives. The public health perspective is influenced largely by cost-benefit ratios; the community perspective by a strong desire to alleviate suffering and disability from disease and from vaccine side-effects; and that of vaccine producers by demand, technological feasibility of development, and anticipated return on investment. Each of these perspectives is important. However, they often are mutually exclusive. From a humanitarian and epidemiological perspective, the most urgent needs related to communicable diseases are those of the poorest countries; in the industrialised world, with the exception of the vaccine for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), public health priorities, evaluated in terms of the cost-benefit ratio, often differ from those of the market, which usually selects its priorities according to return on investment. The six vaccines used in the Expanded Programme of Immunisation (EPI) are offered cheaply through a highly efficient bidding system. It would have to be extended, under the same form or differently, to other vaccines, such as those for rabies, hepatitis B, or japanese encephalitis. For vaccines that are being developed, such as conjugated polysaccharide or acellular pertussis vaccines, it is difficult to foresee how these expensive vaccines can be distributed. The situation is even worse for vaccines to be developed specifically for the third world. To make these vaccines available to everyone there must be technology that enables producers to sharply reduce production costs, and a subsidy for research and development and production.\r"

Sounds generated by a series of air insufflations through the tubes of 85 acutely-ill adult subjects were recorded. One hundred fifteen usable tape-recordings of sound sequences were obtained. The principal investigator later played the tapes for the research team members (who were also skilled clinicians) so that they could independently record their impressions of the sounds. (No identification of subjects or tube positions were given on the tapes; however, each site of auscultation was announced.) The results were collated and compared against the hypotheses and actual tube location (as determined by X-ray). Overall, the average percentage of correct classifications of each tape was 34.4%. Descriptive data were reported for three subjects with feeding tubes inadvertently positioned in the respiratory tract; air insufflations were clearly audible in 2 of the 3 cases. Clinicians should not rely on the auscultatory method to differentiate gastric from intestinal placement, nor gastric from respiratory placement of feeding tubes.\r"

The key to management of diabetic ketoacidosis is understanding that treatment is aimed more at the breakdown and metabolism of triglycerides in adipose tissue than at hyperglycemia per se. The diabetic hyperosmolar state is most easily treated with aggressive fluid management, with the caveat that too-rapid administration of hypotonic fluids may increase the already significant mortality from this condition. Life-threatening hypoglycemia most commonly occurs with administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin, although other drugs and any malnourished state may also be precipitating factors. Acute administration of glucagon or dextrose alleviates life-threatening hypoglycemia. Success in managing these diabetic emergencies depends on rapidity of recognition and institution of direct treatment measures.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which a single factor evokes opposite regulatory effects from a specific DNA sequence is not well understood. In this study, a 25-base pair element that resides upstream of the mouse proliferin gene was examined; it conferred on linked promoters either positive or negative glucocorticoid regulation, depending upon physiological context. This sequence, denoted a \"composite\" glucocorticoid response element (GRE), was bound selectively in vitro both by the glucocorticoid receptor and by c-Jun and c-Fos, components of the phorbol ester-activated AP-1 transcription factor. Indeed, c-Jun and c-Fos served as selectors of hormone responsiveness: the composite GRE was inactive in the absence of c-Jun, whereas it conferred a positive glucocorticoid effect in the presence of c-Jun, and a negative glucocorticoid effect in the presence of c-Jun and relatively high levels of c-Fos. The receptor also interacted selectively with c-Jun in vitro. A general model for composite GRE action is proposed that invokes both DNA binding and protein-protein interactions by receptor and nonreceptor factors.\r"

After retroviral infection, a recombinant reporter gene was expressed for at least 5 months, and no helper virus was detected. Recombinant gene expression achieved by direct retroviral infection or liposome-mediated DNA transfection was limited to the site of infection and was absent from liver, lung, kidney, and spleen.

  ".W": "The application of isolated pancreatic islet transplantation for treatment of diabetes mellitus has been hampered by the vulnerability of islet allografts to immunologic rejection. Rat islet allografts that were transplanted into the thymus of recipients treated with a single injection of anti-lymphocyte serum survived indefinitely. A state of donor-specific unresponsiveness was achieved that permitted survival of a second donor strain islet allograft transplanted to an extrathymic site. Maturation of T cell precursors in a thymic microenvironment that is harboring foreign alloantigen may induce the selective unresponsiveness. This model provides an approach for pancreatic islet transplantation and a potential strategy for specific modification of the peripheral immune repertoire.\r"

It was shown that neural grafts stored in iloprost solution (50 ng/mL) for 3 hours were more or less in a normal cytoarchitecture compared with saline-preserved grafts. Moreover, it was demonstrated that 4 weeks after transplantation, graft tissues stored in iloprost solution for 3 hours before implantation maintained a successful survival. Thus, a higher cellular population with new vascularization areas and preservation of myelin formation were accepted as a desirable integration of the graft tissue into the host brain tissue. The mechanism of action of iloprost is discussed.\r"

If the peritoneal cavity was entered by a bullet, a laparotomy is required. Missiles subject to magnetic forces can complicate MR imaging. Certain locations of missile fragments predispose to lead poisoning or lead arthropathy. Angiography is useful for both diagnosis and treatment. Both angiographic hemostasis and percutaneous foreign body removal may be used.\r"

Sixteen patients with valvular regurgitation were studied. Six cine acquisition modes were evaluated in five patients. Echo times (TEs) (8, 12, and 17 msec) and flip angles (30 degrees and 50 degrees) were varied. The variable display parameters were [Z x (blood pool signal intensity - lung signal intensity)] at window width (Z = 0.75, 1.00, 1.25) and (Y x window width + lung signal intensity) at window level (Y = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50). The area of the signal void was significantly (p less than .01) affected by the window level (2.7 +/- 0.8 cm2 at Y = 0.00, 4.4 +/- 1.1 cm2 at Y = 0.25, and 5.6 +/- 1.4 cm2 at Y = 0.50) and window width (3.6 +/- 0.9 cm2 at Z = 0.75 and 4.9 +/- 1.1 cm2 at Z = 1.25). With standardized display parameters, TE influenced the area (3.3 +/- 1.1 cm2 at 8 msec and 7.8 +/- 1.5 cm2 at 12 msec; p less than .01). Variations in the value of TE and display settings cause differences in the measured area of the regurgitant signal void. Quantification of valvular regurgitation by cine MR imaging requires strict standardization of display and imaging parameters.\r"

  ".W": "Mammograms from the Canadian National Breast Screening Study (NBSS) were reviewed by three external experts to provide an objective evaluation of their technical quality, to establish a model for auditing mammograms in a screening program, and to assess whether NBSS mammograms improved over time. The sample reviewed included 10 randomly chosen mammograms from each of 15 screening centers for each calendar year of their operation between 1980 and 1987. All 830 mammograms were reviewed on two consecutive days in randomized sequence by each reader, and rated 0-3 for each of four criteria including positioning and image quality, with a total possible score of 0-12. Although the mammograms were not in temporal sequence when reviewed, the scores assigned by each reader were significantly higher for mammograms dating from later years. Subjects' ages at entry (40-49 vs 50-59 years) did not affect the score. The largest increase in scores was associated with a 1985 protocol change in which mediolateral oblique positioning replaced straight mediolateral positioning. This study reinforces the importance of monitoring technical quality in screening programs and establishes that the NBSS benefited from technical improvements during its operation. A retrospective review of NBSS mammography by three external reviewers confirmed that technical quality improved from 1980 to 1987. This improvement was associated with improved technology (film, processing, and units) and with the quality assurance programs operating during the NBSS, which identified problems and offered remedies.\r"

This study demonstrates the effect of computer-generated reminders on the collection of follow-up data for patients in whom abnormalities were detected at mammography screening. From April 1985 until December 1987, follow-up data for 1009 abnormal examinations were collected by using standard procedures, supplemented by occasional searches of pathology records and sporadic letters and telephone calls to referring physicians. Results showed that follow-up was limited to a normal physical examination in 104 women (10.3%); eight other women (0.8%) were lost to follow-up. For over 90% of these inadequately followed cases, referring physicians were first contacted more than 3 months after screening. Since December 1987, follow-up data for 777 abnormal examinations were collected, supplemented by computer-generated reminders sent to referring physicians for cases apparently unresolved 3 months after screening. Only four (0.5%) of these women have had inadequate follow-up (normal physical examination alone). We conclude that use of a computer-generated reminder system prompts more timely and more appropriate patient management. It also makes follow-up data collection much less onerous.\r"

In general, computer-based activities can be completed more rapidly, more reliably, and at lower cost than the conventional operations they are designed to replace.

First, diagnostic performance of the imaging technique with respect to the ability of radiologists to recognize the presence or absence of a metastasis was measured by using receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis of single images. Second, the total number of lesions (N = 108) detected by \"complete\" CT and MR examinations was counted. Finally, lesion-liver contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were measured in all MR sequences. The area under the ROC curve was .67 +/- .03 for contrast-enhanced CT, .81 +/- .07 for the unenhanced SE 260/14 sequence, and .92 +/- .01 for the iron oxide-enhanced SE 1500/40 sequence. The enhanced SE 1500/40 sequence yielded significantly (p less than .005) greater accuracy than did contrast-enhanced CT. The same sequence detected significantly (p less than .05) more lesions than all other imaging techniques (19% more than the best unenhanced MR sequence and 36% more than contrast-enhanced CT). The enhanced SE 1500/40 sequence also yielded the highest CNR value (19.5 +/- 10.2) of all MR sequences. These results indicate that iron oxide-enhanced MR imaging is a superior imaging technique for the detection of hepatic lesions.\r"

Every patient treated in Vancouver has, therefore, had liver function tests and serum amylase levels measured before and within 6 days after BESWL. All patients had symptomatic cholecystolithiasis with normal pre-BESWL biochemistry. Analysis of 311 patients after treatment with the Siemens Lithostar unit showed elevation of one or more laboratory value in 19% (60/311). Serum aspartate transaminase level was most frequently abnormal (38 cases). The majority of abnormalities were mild, less than two times normal levels. Clinically significant complications occurred in five patients (three pancreatitis, one cholecystitis, one common bile duct obstruction); four of these occurred 1 week or more after treatment. The results of routine laboratory tests could not be used to predict complications. No correlation was seen between abnormal values and number of shock waves administered or peak shock-wave pressure. Of 112 patients surveyed at the time of post-BESWL enzyme measurement, 49 (44%) reported a degree of pain, which was severe in eight cases. Presence of severe pain correlated strongly (p less than .001) with abnormal laboratory findings, however not with the degree of abnormality. As results of these laboratory tests are nonspecific, have not been shown to correlate with the degree of severity of BESWL-induced tissue damage, and do not predict complications, the tests are of little value in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms. These conclusions, however, apply only to the Siemens Lithostar Plus with patients treated in the steep left posterior oblique position. Cost savings can be expected if routine post-BESWL biochemical tests are abandoned.\r"

Forty-four patients had common bile and/or common hepatic duct stones, 21 patients had cystic duct stones, and five patients had intrahepatic duct stones. A total of 43 patients (61%) had complete elimination of stone fragments during the initial treatment period. If patients in whom stones were successfully fragmented yet not totally eliminated on initial hospital treatment but who were asymptomatic at follow-up times of 8-22 months are included, the overall successful treatment rate was 83%. Stones were cleared in 26 of 44 common bile/hepatic duct stone patients, spontaneously in seven patients and after endoscopic or percutaneous radiologic intervention in 19 patients. Fifteen (71%) of 21 patients had cystic duct stones successfully cleared. The fragments in two of five patients with intrahepatic duct stones also were cleared. Five patients (7%) had minor side effects. Seven (10%) of 70 patients went on to have surgery. Complications after 30 days occurred in five patients (7%); two required repeated endoscopy with fragment extraction, two required placement of an endoprosthesis, and one died. We conclude that biliary extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is valuable as an adjuvant to standard interventional techniques for removing bile duct stones.\r"

During the second stage, performed at least 10 days later, the stones were fragmented with a laser and removed. Fragmentation of the stones was successful in all patients. In six patients, the gallbladder was completely cleared of stones, as assessed with endoscopy and cholecystography. In two patients, residual fragments remained in the gallbladder. No laser-related complications occurred. This preliminary experience suggests that the pulsed-dye laser is safe and effective in endoscopically directed lithotripsy of gallbladder stones.\r"

The aim of our study was to describe and analyze the pulsatile portal venous waveform in which minimum velocity dropped to or below zero on duplex Doppler sonography and to investigate its possible association with tricuspid regurgitation, one of the causes of liver dysfunction. We correlated the findings in 15 patients in whom this duplex Doppler waveform was seen with the findings on Doppler echocardiography (n = 14) or ultrafast CT (n = 1). All patients had biochemical liver abnormalities or sudden onset of ascites, rapid weight gain, increased abdominal girth, and hepatomegaly. They were referred for sonography to rule out liver metastases, biliary disease, portal vein thrombosis, or Budd-Chiari syndrome. All examinations were done with a 3-MHz phased-array sector transducer with duplex Doppler capability. Seventeen volunteers with no known liver or heart disease served as a control group. We correlated maximum and minimum flow velocities on the portal venous Doppler waveform with the portal vein diameters of the study and control groups. Thirteen patients were later proved to have tricuspid regurgitation, one patient had an aortic-right atrial fistula owing to rupture of an aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva, and one patient was proved to be normal. In none of the 17 control subjects was this pulsatile portal venous waveform seen. Our study shows that detection of a pulsatile portal venous waveform on duplex Doppler sonography in patients with liver dysfunction should raise the possibility of tricuspid regurgitation.\r"

  ".W": "The use of sonography to determine the patency of surgically created biliary-enteric anastomoses has been questioned by authors who favor use of cholescintigraphy and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography for this purpose. We retrospectively reviewed the sonographic findings in 35 patients with such anastomoses: 16 choledochojejunostomies, 11 choledochoduodenostomies, five intrahepatic cholangiojejunostomies, and three cholecystoenterostomies. The anastomosis was patent in 25 patients, completely obstructed in four, and partially obstructed in six. Five of the 25 patients with patent anastomoses had nonanastomotic complications with biliary stasis and cholangitis. In the 20 patients with patent anastomoses and no complication, sonography showed bile ducts ranging from 2 to 9 mm in diameter filled with bile (six), gas (two), or both (12). No patient with a normally functioning anastomosis had evidence of a dilated bile-filled duct in the upright position. In four patients with complete obstruction of the anastomosis, sonography showed dilated, bile-filled ducts ranging from 6 to 14 mm in diameter proximal to the anastomosis. Sonograms in all six patients with partial obstruction showed both gas and bile in dilated bile ducts with superficial gas-filled ducts and dependent bile-filled ducts creating gas/fluid interfaces, which were persistent in the upright position. The 15 patients with anastomotic obstruction or other complication had confirmatory percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (nine patients), scintigraphy (five patients), CT (four patients), and surgery (eight patients). Our experience suggests that sonography can be used to accurately assess surgically created biliary-enteric anastomoses for both anastomotic patency and for other complications.\r"

In 54 patients, sonography showed different degrees of hypoechoic bowel wall thickening; gastrointestinal lymphoma was confirmed by histologic examination in all of these patients (non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 50, Hodgkin disease in four). Nineteen of the 54 patients had primary gastrointestinal lymphoma; the other 35 had widespread tumor with secondary gastrointestinal involvement. The portions of gastrointestinal tract involved included the stomach (38), small intestine (five), colon (seven), and multiple sites (four). Several sonographic patterns were found: 39 patients had circumferential involvement of the bowel wall, four had bulky tumors, and two had nodular extraluminal spread. Eight patients had segmental infiltration, and one had mucosal involvement. The results of this study indicate that sonography is of value for examining patients with gastrointestinal lymphoma and that several patterns of involvement can be detected.\r"

CT grade of malignancy in peritoneal tumors was categorized as low (four patients) and high (three patients) on the basis of the degree of central necrosis of the tumors. The CT results correlated with the histopathologic grade of malignancy, although all tumors were grade 2 or higher histopathologically. Ascites and lymphadenopathy were not present in any of the patients. Liver metastases were identified in five patients with central necrosis of the metastases evident in four. The presence of liver metastases and the degree of central necrosis in the liver metastases did not correlate with the size or histologic grade of the primary tumor. Although uncommon, peritoneal leiomyosarcomatosis should be considered when CT shows multiple, discrete peritoneal masses with central necrosis and liver metastases in the absence of ascites and lymphadenopathy.\r"

In this study, we compared the accuracy of a metal detector with that of plain radiographs for the localization of ingested metallic objects. Twenty-eight consecutive patients with the presumptive diagnosis of metallic foreign-body ingestion were examined with a metal detector. The results were compared with those of plain radiographs which were considered the gold standard. Fifteen positive cases and 13 negative cases were correctly diagnosed by metal detector examination. No false-positive or false-negative results occurred. Our experience suggests that metal detection is a simple and accurate technique for the localization of ingested metallic objects and provides information equivalent to that from plain radiographs for the treatment of patients with suspected foreign-body ingestion.\r"

To assess this application of sonography, we examined 300 patients with transrectal sonography of the prostate and seminal vesicles followed by histologic examination of the seminal vesicles from core biopsies and/or prostatectomy specimens. Of the 38 patients with histologically proved seminal vesicle invasion by prostatic cancer, 35 (92%) had an abnormal appearance of the seminal vesicles on sonography. Of 167 patients with prostatic cancer without histologic evidence of seminal vesicle involvement, sonograms showed abnormal seminal vesicles in 42 (25%). In 95 patients with histologically normal prostates and seminal vesicles, sonograms showed abnormal seminal vesicles in 11 (12%). The sonographic findings correlating best with tumor invasion of the seminal vesicles were hyperechogenicity and a combination of two or more of the following abnormalities: cystic dilatation, asymmetry, enlargement, and anterior displacement. Our experience in these patients suggests that endorectal sonography can be useful in the detection of seminal vesicle involvement by prostatic cancer.\r"

  ".W": "This review examines the role of MR imaging in the diagnosis and staging of tumors and tumorlike lesions of bone and soft tissue. For tumors of bone, the plain radiograph is not only the least expensive diagnostic test but is the most reliable predictor of the histologic nature of a given lesion. Consequently, it should be the first procedure performed and serve as the basis for determining the next step in the patient's evaluation. MR imaging is the examination of choice for staging bone tumors. CT is preferred to MR imaging only when the characteristics of the lesion are inadequately defined on plain radiographs, as may occur in flat bones. Although MR imaging is of limited value in predicting the histology of bone tumors, it is a useful tool for distinguishing round-cell tumors and metastases from stress fractures and medullary infarcts in symptomatic patients with normal radiographs. For depiction of soft-tissue masses, MR imaging is unrivaled. The histologic nature of a soft-tissue mass may, in some instances, be predicted on the basis of its MR appearance and multicentricity. Biopsy of bone and soft-tissue tumors should follow and not precede MR imaging. MR imaging reliably shows change in tumor volume after radiation or chemotherapy. It is less reliable in predicting the amount of tumor necrosis.\r"

In the women with osteoporotic vertebral fractures, all three measuring methods showed significantly reduced values (SPA: p less than .05; QCT: p less than .0001; BUA: p less than .05) compared with those in the control subjects. In addition, for all subjects, a significant positive correlation was found between BUA and QCT (tau = 0.25, p less than .005) and between SPA and QCT (tau = 0.34, p less than .0001). These results suggest that BUA, a simple method that is radiation-free, is a valuable tool in the management of osteoporosis.\r"

Results were correlated with surgical findings in all patients. Nine patients had surgically proved labral tears. MR arthrography detected all nine labral abnormalities, while six of the nine were missed on conventional MR imaging. Fourteen patients had surgically proved rotator cuff tears. MR arthrography detected 11 of the 14 tears and missed three partial tears on the bursal surface. Conventional MR imaging detected nine cuff tears and missed five tears; two of these were complete rotator cuff tears and three were partial tears of the undersurface of the rotator cuff. Our results suggest that MR arthrography enhances the accuracy of MR in the evaluation of the glenoid labrum and rotator cuff tendon.\r"

A total of 226 children (less than or equal to 2 years old) with and without signs and symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections were examined to assess the yield of chest radiographs. The radiograph was considered positive only if a focal parenchymal infiltrate was present. Hyperinflation or bronchial thickening was not included as a positive finding because these children usually do not receive antibiotics despite the fact that viral illness or reactive airway disease may be present. In a retrospective study of 105 infants, confidence intervals for yield were established for children with (95% Cl = 12%, 32%) and without (95% Cl = 0%, 14%) symptoms or signs of lower respiratory tract infection. In a prospective study of 121 infants without chest symptoms or signs, confidence levels for positive yield were better defined (95% Cl = 0%, 3%). The data suggest that obtaining chest radiographs to look for parenchymal infiltrates treatable with antibiotics in infants less than 2 years old is necessary only in those infants who have clinical evidence of lower respiratory tract illness.\r"

Two pathologically proved and four presumed optic nerve meningiomas demonstrated significant enhancement and were best seen with the fat-suppression technique. None of the three presumed optic nerve gliomas nor the optic nerves of normal subjects demonstrated qualitative enhancement.

To clarify the anatomic and embryologic features of intracranial lipomas, we retrospectively reviewed the MR scans of 42 patients with 44 intracranial lipomas. Interhemispheric lipomas were the most common, accounting for 45% of cases. The remainder of the lesions were clustered in the quadrigeminal/superior cerebellar (25%), suprasellar/interpeduncular (14%), cerebellopontine angle (9%), and sylvian (5%) cisterns. Fifty-five percent of the lesions were associated with brain malformations of varying degrees. Intracranial vessels and nerves were noted to course through 16 (36%) of the lesions. The relative frequencies of the locations of the lipomas correspond to the temporal sequence of dissolution of the meninx primitiva, the mesenchymal anlage of the meninges. This finding supports the concept of lipoma formation as a result of abnormal persistence and maldifferentiation of the meninx. This embryologic concept of the development of intracranial lipomas explains the high frequency of callosal and other brain hypoplasias. Intracranial lipomas are neither hamartomas nor true neoplasms; rather, they are congenital malformations.\r"

From June 1988 to March 1989, 193 postoperative patients had MR imaging of the lumbar spine both with and without contrast administration. Of this group, 27 had repeat surgery at 31 levels: these patients comprise the study group. Postcontrast MR diagnoses were as follows: scar only (n = 4), disk only (n = 13), scar and disk (n = 9), and no aberrant epidural tissue (n = 5). Surgical diagnoses differed from the MR diagnoses in two patients at two levels. In one patient, disk was diagnosed on MR while osteophyte was present at surgery. In the other patient, scar only was diagnosed by MR but disk and scar were present at surgery. These data, when combined with the authors' previous experience, give pre- and postcontrast MR a 96% accuracy in differentiating scar from disk in 44 patients at 50 reoperated levels. For patients 6 or more weeks past surgery, sagittal and axial T1-weighted MR imaging before and after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine is an effective method of evaluating the postoperative lumbar spine.\r"

The arachnoiditis was proved by previous myelography in 12 patients and by noncontrast MR imaging in one patient. The disease was presumably the result of previous myelography and/or surgery. It was characterized as mild in two patients, moderate in two patients, and severe in nine patients. Imaging was performed on a 1.5-T unit, and both short and long TR images were obtained before and after contrast administration. Noncontrast MR images demonstrated changes consistent with arachnoiditis in all patients. After contrast, three patients had no enhancement, three patients had minimal enhancement, three patients had mild enhancement, and four patients had moderate enhancement. In no case did contrast enhancement alter the diagnosis or reveal additional findings that could not be seen on the noncontrast images. Gadopentetate dimeglumine enhancement plays little role in the diagnosis of lumbar arachnoiditis. If used for another reason, however, short TR scans may show enhancement of adherent roots in some cases. In addition, administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine will not cause sufficient enhancement to hinder the detection of arachnoiditis on long TR images and may aid in recognition of adherent roots on short TR images.\r"

  ".W": "The platelet aggregation response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and to thrombin was quantified in 10 patients, 5 with unstable angina pectoris and 5 with acute myocardial infarction, before, during and after a 45-minute infusion of nitroglycerin. An impedance aggregometer allowing rapid bedside studies in whole blood was used. The reproducibility of the methods was documented to be within 10%. Doses of nitroglycerin were titrated for a 10 mm Hg decrease in mean arterial blood pressure with mean doses being 1.2 +/- 0.2 (standard error of the mean) micrograms/kg/min. Nitroglycerin decreased the area under the aggregation curve induced by ADP from 43 +/- 3.6 to 30 +/- 6.3 cm2 (p = 0.007) and by thrombin from 8.9 +/- 1.7 to 4.1 +/- 0.9 cm2 (p = 0.003). Peak responses to ADP were decreased from 13.3 +/- 1 to 9.1 +/- 1.7 ohms (p = 0.005) and to thrombin from 9.3 +/- 2 to 5.0 +/- 1.2 ohms (p = 0.003). All patients had greater than or equal to 50% inhibition with 1 agent or the other and the inhibition was greater than 50% with each of the 2 aggregating agents in 6 patients. Analyses performed on blood withdrawn 15 minutes after the discontinuation of nitroglycerin showed a return to baseline before nitroglycerin results. When analyses were delayed and performed on blood preserved at room temperature for 30 minutes, no effect of nitroglycerin could be detected. Thus, bedside platelet aggregation studies document a significant and reversible effect of nitroglycerin at therapeutic doses on platelet function.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of intracoronary nitroglycerin on coronary stenosis dimensions and translesional hemodynamics was evaluated in 38 subjects (74 stenoses) referred for diagnostic coronary arteriography. Quantitative coronary arteriography was performed with standard Newtonian fluid dynamic equations used to estimate transstenotic gradients. Since intracoronary nitroglycerin can induce significant myocardial hyperemia (increased flow velocity), with increased translesional pressure gradients and a decrease in distal intraluminal pressure, the potential effect on subendocardial flow distribution was also analyzed. Minimum stenotic diameter significantly increased postnitroglycerin (NTG) (preNTG 1.42 vs postNTG 1.82 mm, p less than 0.01), with a decrease in relative percent diameter stenosis (preNTG 45.7 vs postNTG 40.7%, p less than 0.05). When changes in minimum stenotic diameter were analyzed according to stenosis severity (quartiles), the greatest effect was noted in those lesions with the least severe stenosis (quartile no. 1, 0.49 vs quartile no. 4, 0.32 mm, p less than 0.05). If coronary blood flow velocity remains at baseline values (4 cm/s), intracoronary nitroglycerin was predicted to significantly decrease transstenotic pressure gradients (preNTG 1.01 vs postNTG 0.82 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), with the greatest change shown in severe lesions (quartile no. 4, preNTG 3.79 to postNTG 2.28 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). Accelerated coronary flow velocity (myocardial hyperemia) increased calculated translesional pressure gradients (4 cm/s, 0.82 mm Hg vs 20 cm/s, 8.00 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), despite simultaneous stenotic vasodilation. Hemodynamic obstruction was particularly dependent on coronary flow velocity in the most severe stenoses (quartile no. 4, 4 cm/s, 2.28 vs 20 cm/s, 28.78 mm Hg, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We detected tau mRNA using in situ hybridization histochemistry in the hippocampus, visual cortex, and cerebellum, and compared its level in Alzheimer's disease with controls. The amount of tau mRNA also was determined as a ratio of total polyadenylated mRNA in each area. A significant and gene-specific increase in tau mRNA hybridization was found in hippocampal fields CA4 and CA3, with a similar trend in the dentate gyrus. In contrast, no change was found in the visual cortex or cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease. Increased hippocampal expression of tau mRNA also was present in cases of non-Alzheimer's dementia. Enhanced tau mRNA may be a marker of attempted plasticity involving the cytoskeleton in neuronal populations affected by various neurodegenerative disorders.\r"

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR-positive cells formed dense rings around all plaque regions. The majority were reactive microglia/macrophages. Counterstaining with oil red O revealed heavy myelin debris within these cells. They were distinct from astrocytes, which were identified with an antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and which did not contain oil red O myelin debris. Numerous leukocytes and microglia were stained with antibody to leukocyte common antigen (LCA). Lymphocytes in cuffs around vessels, along the margins of capillary walls, and, sparingly, in the tissue matrix of affected areas, were stained with antibodies to CD4 (T-helper/inducer) and CD8 (T-cytotoxic/suppressor). In experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced in Lewis rats, a similar proliferation of Ia-positive (OX6, OX17) cells displaying reactive microglia/macrophage morphology was observed. These Ia-positive cells also were easily distinguished from GFAP-positive astrocytes. The results suggest that macrophages/reactive microglia, and not astrocytes, express class II MHC antigens in multiple sclerosis and EAE plaques.\r"

  ".U": "90379239\r", 
  ".W": "Fifty-seven cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma were studied for cell expression of the T-cell receptor (TCR) chains, using monoclonal antibodies specific for the beta chain (beta F1) of the alpha/beta TCR, and for the delta chain (anti-TCR delta-1) of the gamma/delta TCR. Three different patterns were demonstrated: in 39 cases (69%), the phenotype (CD3+beta F1+TCR delta-1-) was that of most normal T cells. A second pattern was found on six cases (10%), which were of CD3+beta F1-TCR delta-1+ phenotype, and in which DNA analysis showed a clonal rearrangement of the delta locus in the five cases studied. It is suggested that these cases are the neoplastic counterpart of the small subpopulation of normal T cells that express gamma delta receptor. It is of considerable interest that these gamma delta lymphomas had unusual clinicopathologic presentations, as one case corresponded to a lethal midline granuloma and the five others to hepatosplenic lymphomas with a sinusal/sinusoidal infiltration in spleen, marrow, and liver. The fact that the distribution of the neoplastic gamma delta cells in the splenic red pulp resembles that of normal gamma delta cells reinforces the concept of a preferential homing of gamma delta T cells to this tissue. A third pattern (CD3 +/- beta F1-TCR delta-1-) was seen in 12 cases (21%), in which, by contrast to normal post-thymic T cells, no evidence of either alpha beta or gamma delta T cell receptor was found.\r"

Intracellular tangles were immunolabeled exclusively by two antibodies raised against antigens in the fuzzy coat of the paired helical filament (PHF). Extracellular tangles were distinguished by selective immunolabeling with a monoclonal antibody raised against antigens in the PHF core. This was associated with removal of the fuzzy coat and exposure of PHF-core epitopes. In the transition from intracellular to extracellular compartments in vivo, tangles appeared to undergo changes similar to protease digestion in vitro. The transition was associated with the appearance of amyloid immunoreactivity. These findings suggest that tangle degradation occurs in a series of distinct stages, including ubiquitination of some unknown molecule, a change in tau immunoreactivity, and partial proteolysis of tangle-bound tau in extracellular tangles.\r"

Endotracheal anesthesia was begun with midazolam (mean +/- SD dose 12.4 +/- 2.4 mg), followed by nitrous oxide in oxygen, fentanyl, and succinylcholine, for gynecologic surgery lasting 38.6 +/- 12.5 min. After surgery, 29 women were given repeated injections of small amounts of either flumazenil or placebo until awake and calm. The mean flumazenil dose was 0.83 +/- 0.04 mg. Assessment of recovery was based on psychodiagnostic tests (visual analog sedation scale, Trieger dot, digit symbol substitution), pulse oxygen saturation, and end-expired carbon dioxide tension. Patients given flumazenil scored significantly better than did those given placebo on the psychodiagnostic tests for 5-60 min, but the groups were no longer different 120 and 180 min after the conclusion of surgery. All scores did not return to preoperative values by 180 min. Pulse oxygen saturation and end-expired carbon dioxide tension showed improvement from postoperative levels at 15 min after flumazenil injection. A controllable degree of midazolam reversal was achieved with flumazenil, but the duration of reversal was limited. Caution is needed to avoid premature discharge of ambulatory patients after midazolam-induced general anesthesia during the time that flumazenil is effective.\r"

Monitored variables included CSFP (lumbar subarachnoid catheter), heart rate from electrocardiographic lead II, mean radial arterial blood pressure, and arterial blood gas tensions. General anesthesia was induced with thiopental, 5 mg/kg IV in divided doses, and maintained with 70% N2O in O2; ventilation was held constant (PaCO2 = 37.4 +/- 1.6 mm Hg [mean +/- SEM]). After baseline data were recorded, 16 subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 5 micrograms/kg fentanyl as an intravenous bolus or 50 micrograms/kg alfentanil as an intravenous bolus, followed by an infusion of alfentanil at 1 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. Monitored variables were continuously recorded for 15 min after opioid injection. A third group of 8 patients was studied subsequently; they received only N2O-O2 during a 15-min observation period and served as controls. Blood pressure was held constant with an intravenous infusion of 0.1% phenylephrine, as needed; noxious stimulation was carefully avoided. Cerebrospinal fluid pressure remained unchanged both in patients who received N2O-O2 alone and in those who received fentanyl-N2O-O2. By contrast, those who received alfentanil-N2O-O2 had a gradual increase in CSFP, reaching 30% above baseline values after 10 min and stabilizing thereafter. Although the absolute increase in CSFP during normocarbic alfentanil-N2O anesthesia was relatively small (9.5 +/- 1.3 mm Hg to 13.0 +/- 1.3 mm Hg [mean +/- SE], P less than 0.05), the absence of a similar effect after fentanyl administration suggests that precautionary measures such as hyperventilation are advisable if alfentanil is used for potentiating normocarbic N2O-O2 anesthesia in neurosurgical patients with intracranial mass lesions.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized evaluation of two heparin regimens in 41 consecutive patients meeting eligibility requirements for anticoagulant prophylaxis. Daily bedside examinations were supplemented by serial venous flow studies; suspicious or positive tests were confirmed by venography. INTERVENTION: Standard heparin, 5000 units subcutaneously three times a day; low-molecular-weight heparin 3500 anti-Xa units subcutaneously once daily. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Five patients in the standard heparin group had thrombotic events, including two patients with fatal pulmonary embolism; two other patients had bleeding severe enough to necessitate withdrawing the heparin. The cumulative event rate was 34.7% (95% CI, 13.7% to 55.2%). None of the patients treated with low-molecular-weight heparin had thrombosis or bleeding (CI, 0% to 14%). The difference between the two groups was significant (P = 0.006, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Low-molecular-weight heparin is safe and effective in the prevention of thromboembolism in selected patients with spinal cord injury and complete motor paralysis, and is superior to standard heparin in fixed doses of 5000 units three times a day.\r"

  ".W": "Bone mass measurement at menopause to identify and selectively prescribe hormone replacement therapy for women at high risk for fractures has seen limited clinical use. We used epidemiologic, clinical, and economic data in a decision-analytic model to compare the following clinical strategies for perimenopausal, asymptomatic, white women with intact uteri: no intervention; bone mineral density measurement followed by selective, long-term (15-year) estrogen-progestin therapy in women with low bone mass; and unselective, universal hormone replacement therapy. Life expectancy and direct medical cost per patient were estimated for each strategy. Strategies for screening and treating women with perimenopausal bone mineral density less than 0.9 g/cm2 or less than 1.0 g/cm2 would cost $11,700 or $22,100, respectively, per year of additional life gained. If the cost of screening is less than $84, then resource savings from hip fractures prevented would be more than the cost of screening and treatment. Universal treatment without screening would prevent additional fatal fractures but would expose many more women to the adverse effects of hormone replacement therapy and would cost an additional $349,000 per year of life gained compared with the screening strategies. When quality of life was considered, screening was found to be cost effective over a wide range of assumptions. The choice between universal treatment and screening depends on the risks (breast cancer), perceived side effects (menstrual bleeding), and benefits (prevention of ischemic heart disease) of estrogen-progestin therapy. We conclude that screening asymptomatic, perimenopausal white women to detect low bone mass and to target hormone replacement therapy at women who are at the greatest risk for fracture is a reasonably cost-effective use of health care resources. However, cost-effective screening guidelines cannot be explicitly established until further data addressing the association between bone mass measurements in the hip and hip fracture risk are available.\r"

Use of absorbable sutures has been shown to be superior to use of nonabsorbable sutures in allowing growth of an anastomotic site along with the individual. Some concern has been raised, however, about the potential for aneurysm formation at the site of anastomosis when absorbable sutures are used. This study was undertaken to observe the effects of longitudinal tension on anastomoses made with absorbable polydioxanone suture in growing animals. Six piglets (aged 3 to 4 weeks) underwent a 1-cm resection of the infrarenal aorta and reanastomosis with polydioxanone suture. One animal died prematurely of respiratory illness. The 5 remaining animals were killed after 6 months. The excised aortas demonstrated no stenosis, no dilatation, and no burst-test failure to 250 mm Hg. Histological examination showed disrupted elastic laminae without thinning of aortic wall in all samples of aorta. We conclude that polydioxanone suture is a suitable suture material for vascular anastomoses made under tension where growth of the anastomotic site is expected.\r"

Staphylococcus aureus reached high levels beneath all of the dressings and in the air-exposed wounds. The numbers of C perfringens and B fragilis were greatly reduced in the air-exposed wounds and slightly reduced in the Opsite-covered wounds. The numbers of P aeruginosa were greatest in the Opsite- and Vigilon-covered wounds. The results indicate that occlusive dressings are not indicated in wounds that clinically appear to be grossly contaminated or that may contain anaerobic organisms.\r"

Eyes from dogs in each group were periodically enucleated during a 36-month period and their retinal capillaries were examined as trypsin-digested flat preparations. These studies reveal that the destruction of retinal pericytes to form pericyte ghosts is the earliest observable retinal vessel change occurring after 19 to 21 months of galactose feeding. By 24 months, both an irregular distribution of endothelial cell nuclei near pericyte ghosts and the presence of acellular capillaries containing neither endothelial cells nor pericytes can be observed. This was followed by the histologic appearance of microaneurysms after 27 months and the funduscopic appearance of intraretinal hemorrhages after 33 months. Varicose enlargements of capillaries were also observed in the trypsin-digested preparations from dogs fed galactose for 33 to 36 months. All of these changes are linked to the initial aldose reductase-associated destruction of pericytes. The onset and progression of these retinal changes were retarded in a dose-dependent manner with aldose reductase inhibitors.\r"

Histologic analysis of spleen colonies from control and LIF-treated marrows demonstrated that there was no detectable alteration in the differentiative potential of CFU-S13. The efficiency of CFU-S13 infection was increased from 15% in untreated controls to 84% to 91% in LIF-treated marrows.

Platelet FcR was crosslinked by incubating purified human platelets with anti-FcRII monoclonal antibody and F(ab')2 anti-mouse Ig. The resultant [Ca2+]i increase, monitored by Fura-2 and measured in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, reached a peak of 750 +/- 50 nmol/L. The effects of cyclooxygenase inhibitors, aspirin and indomethacin, and a phospholipase A2 inhibitor, dibromoacetophenone, were examined. Regardless of the inhibitor, at least 25% of the [Ca2+]i increase remained. Thrombin (0.2 U/mL) stimulated an immediate [Ca2+]i increase that reached 1.95 +/- 0.8 mumol/L. The [Ca2+]i increase generated by thrombin was only slightly reduced by these inhibitors. Crosslinking the FcRII of platelets resulted in a fivefold increase in the production of [3H]inositol phosphates, (IP) which, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ was insensitive to aspirin. The activation of a [Ca2+]i increase along with the measured increases in IP indicate that FcRII crosslinking leads to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC). In contrast to thrombin, platelet activation via FcRII depends to a large extent on arachidonic acid metabolites. However, neither cyclooxygenase nor phospholipase A2 inhibitors completely blocked FcRII-stimulated [Ca2+]i increase. These observations led us to propose that crosslinking of platelet FcRII initially activates PLC.\r"

  ".W": "The proto-oncogene c-fos has been implicated in the modulation of various cell functions. We have found that thrombin, a pleiotropic activator of endothelial cells, induced c-fos mRNA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HEC). This effect was dose-related (0.05 to 1.0 U/mL) and transient (maximal after 1 hour and negligible within 4 hours). Since thrombin activates phosphoinositide (PI) turnover through a pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive guanosine triphosphate-binding regulatory protein(s) (G-protein) with subsequent stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) and Ca2+ movements, we investigated whether these intracellular pathways are also responsible for c-fos induction. PT inhibited thrombin's effect on c-fos expression, but had no effect on c-fos expression by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Down regulation of PKC by prolonged exposure to PMA had no effect on thrombin and ionomycin stimulation of c-fos, but inhibited PMA activation of this gene. Quenching of the Ca1(2+) increase in response to quin2 loading in the absence of external Ca2+ suppressed thrombin activity on c-fos transcription. Under the same conditions PMA activity was not inhibited or only partially inhibited. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) stimulation of c-fos mRNA level were not inhibited by quin2; on the contrary, ionomycin effect was blocked by this agent. These results indicate that thrombin-induced c-fos expression in HEC does not require a fully active PKC but is dependent on normal intracellular Ca2+ availability.\r"

The hBMMCs were incubated in the presence of rhIL-3 and the changes in their proliferation rate were determined. Recombinant hIL-3 induced a more than sixfold increase in 3H-thymidine uptake into the hBMMC DNA in a dose-dependent manner. Human CM used as a control for proliferation response induced a more than eightfold maximal proliferation rate increase. Rabbit anti-rhIL-3 completely inhibited hBMMC 3H-thymidine uptake induced by rhIL-3 and decreased the hCM-induced proliferation by approximately 50%. These hBMMCs were cocultured with four different mytomicin C-treated cell monolayers and assayed for phenotypic changes. After only 2 days in coculture with either embryonic mouse skin-derived fibroblasts (MESFs) or human skin-derived fibroblasts (HSFs), a marked increase in granule number and density was noted on staining with toluidine blue. Mast cells that initially stained alcian blue+/safranin- at day 0 of coculture became alcian blue+/safranin+ during the coculture period. Human BMMC proteoglycan synthesis shifted from approximately 85% chondroitin sulfate E to approximately 60% heparin within 14 to 19 days of coculture with the MESF monolayer and to approximately 50% heparin within 19 days of coculture with the HSF monolayer. None of the above-mentioned changes were noted in cocultures of hBMMCs with 3T3 cell line fibroblast monolayers or in cocultures with bovine vascular endothelium (BVE) cell monolayers. These results demonstrate microenvironmental effects exerted by the MESF and HSF monolayers on IL-3-dependent hBMMCs similar to those reported in the conversion of murine mast cell phenotype.\r"

The infection of a variety of cultured and primary lymphoid cells with a recombinant retrovirus containing a histone promoter-driven beta-galactosidase gene is shown to result in the expression of beta-galactosidase in 50% to 100% of the cells. A similar infection with a recombinant retrovirus containing the beta-galactosidase gene with an adenovirus E2 promoter, results in beta-galactosidase activity in a limited number of cultured and primary cells. Since the adenovirus E2 promoter has been well characterized and is known to be regulated by transactivators encoded by many viruses, the activity of this promoter in specific cell types is discussed in reference to both the biology of the cell and the possible presence of as yet undetected viral gene products.\r"

  ".W": "Hb A2 and its variant B2 (alpha 2 delta 2(16)(A13)Gly----Arg) were quantitated in the blood of subjects with three different types of beta-thalassemia and with the delta-B2 anomaly in cis or in trans to the beta-thalassemia determinant. In one family, the delta-B2 mutation was in cis to a newly discovered codon 47 (+A) frameshift. The levels of Hbs A2 and B2 were nearly the same and approximately 70% higher than those in simple Hb B2 heterozygotes. In two additional families, the delta-B2 variant was in trans to either a deletional beta-thalassemia (1,393 bp) involving part of the beta-globin gene and part of the beta-globin gene promoter, or to the -88 C----T promoter mutation. In both instances, the Hb B2 level was increased by approximately 80%, but the Hb A2 level was increased by approximately 270% and 200%, respectively. These data indicate two mechanisms that will cause an increase in delta chain production. One is consistent with a general mechanism concerning the relative excess of alpha chains in beta chain deficiencies which will combine with delta chains to form variable levels of Hb A2 dependent on the severity of the beta chain deficiency. The second concerns the loss of beta-globin gene promoter activity, perhaps by an absence of (or decreased) binding of specific protein(s) to this segment of DNA and a concomitant increase in delta-globin gene promoter activity in cis.\r"

The magnitude of the various components have been determined by analysing measurements of square and rectangular fields, involving the fitting of the scatter data to an exponential function of radial distance from the scatter element. The coefficient and exponent of this function were found to be functions of depth, and this variation is described. A method of utilizing reconstructed scatter data that is compatible with the motion of a multileaf collimator system is presented.

Twenty-three (53%) of the patients had neurofibromatosis (VRN), whereas 20 (47%) did not. Fifty-one percent of the patients were women. The mean age at presentation was 36 years for patients with VRN and 44 years for patients without VRN. A nerve of origin was identified for 72% of the cases and an associated neurofibroma for 44% (65% with VRN and 20% without VRN). The mean greatest dimension of the tumors was 12.3 cm, and this did not differ significantly between the two groups. The predominant histologic pattern in 86% of the tumors was that of tightly packed spindle cells in an interlacing and woven pattern; heterologous sarcomatous elements were noticed in 12% of the cases. Surgical resection was the main modality of treatment for all patients; 65% also received adjuvant therapy. Follow-up evaluation was done in every case. An unexpected finding was the absence of a significant difference in survival rates between patients with and without VRN. Overall, 63% of the patients died of tumor: 65% of the patients with VRN and 60% of the patients without VRN. Large tumor size and high mitotic rate (greater than 20 per 10 high-power fields) portended a poor prognosis, as did the need for resection by amputation. Adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy did not affect survival rates.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the ability of initial ST segment elevation and depression to predict infarct size limitation by thrombolytic therapy, data were analyzed in 721 patients with acute myocardial infarction who were admitted to a randomized, placebo-controlled study of intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. Patients with QRS duration of 120 msec or more or with previous history of myocardial infarction were excluded, leaving 322 in the treatment and 333 in the placebo group. Cumulative 72-hour release of alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and global ejection fraction as well as left ventricular wall motion derived from angiography were used as independent measures of infarct size. Electrocardiograms obtained at admission, 6 hours after start of therapy, and before discharge were analyzed. All ST measurements were made by hand at the J point and 60 msec after the J point. Patients with high ST segment elevation at admission (i.e., sum of ST elevation at 60 msec after the J point was 20 mm or more) had significantly larger infarction and higher hospital mortality when compared with those with lower (less than 20 mm) ST elevation. Reciprocal ST segment depression also showed a linear relation with infarct size and mortality, independent from ST elevation, both in anterior and inferior myocardial infarction. The sum of deviations measured at the J point and 60 msec after the J point differed significantly, especially in anterior myocardial infarction at admission (mean, 16 +/- 9 versus 23 +/- 11 mm). The prognostic value of one measurement was not, however, superior over the other. Treatment with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator was most effective in those with large ST deviations at admission, but patients with anterior infarction and smaller ST shifts also appeared to benefit from therapy. Results in individual patients were variable, and the overall correlation of initial ST shifts with enzymatic infarct size was rather low. In conclusion, the present study shows that the magnitude of initial ST elevation and also of reciprocal ST depression in the admission electrocardiogram is valuable for the management and assessment of thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Whether XL-FDPs derive from circulating cross-linked fibrin polymers in plasma, compared with clot-associated fibrin, has been questioned because increases in XL-FDP are measured by some assays after fibrinolysis in vitro in the absence of clot. We characterized the source of XL-FDP immunoreactivity in plasma of patients with acute myocardial infarction and ischemic heart disease and the response to plasminogen activation in vitro induced by pharmacological concentrations of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and streptokinase. XL-FDPs were measured with two different ELISA. One, \"pan-specific tag ELISA,\" was based on a capture MAb specific for XL-FDP and a tag MAb that recognizes an epitope exposed in the fragment D region of both fibrin and fibrinogen, whereas the other, \"fibrin-specific tag ELISA,\" was based on a capture and tag MAbs both specific for fibrin. After plasminogen activation was induced in vitro in plasma from patients with myocardial infarction, increased concentrations of XL-FDP were measured by the pan-specific tag ELISA; however, concentrations measured with the fibrin-specific tag ELISA were not increased. To determine the mechanism for this discrepancy, plasma was subjected to immunoadsorption with a MAb specific for fragment D-dimer before and after in vitro activation of the fibrinolytic system and immunoblotting with a fragment D-dimer-specific MAb and with the pan-specific MAb. Increased concentrations of fragment D-dimer, as well as fibrinogen fragment D at high concentrations, were recognized by the specific MAb. Non-cross-linked fragments were also shown by immunoblotting with the pan-specific MAb to coprecipitate with cross-linked fibrin fragments. This suggested the increased concentrations of XL-FDP measured by the pan-specific tag ELISA after in vitro activation of the fibrinolytic system were due to detection of non-cross-linked fibrinogen fragments. However, fibrin fragment D-dimer concentrations were found to increase in plasma of 15 patients given t-PA for acute myocardial infarction. We conclude fragment D-dimer in plasma of patients during thrombolysis does not originate from circulating soluble cross-linked fibrin but rather is a marker of solid-phase fibrin dissolution, which may be quantitated with assays based on capture and tag antibodies that do not detect fibrinogen or its degradation products.\r"

For this purpose, in 13 normal volunteers, the reflex chronotropic responses to arterial baroreceptor stimulation (phenylephrine, 25-100 micrograms i.v.) or deactivation (nitroglycerin, 25-100 micrograms i.v.) were evaluated in control conditions and during the steady-state phase of a sustained infusion of ANF (50 ng/kg/min) or placebo, before and during prolonged treatment with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg p.o. for 5 days). ANF infusion, which raised plasma ANF levels from 48 +/- 19 to 1,765 +/- 203 pg/ml, was associated with a slight decrease in systemic blood pressure and no change in heart rate. In addition, it caused a significant increase of the regression slope obtained with phenylephrine (from 11.3 +/- 2 to 18.5 +/- 2 msec/mm Hg) and a significant reduction of slope of the nitroglycerin-produced regression line (from 9.3 +/- 1 to 5.6 +/- 0.6 msec/mm Hg). After sustained CEI, which raised plasma renin activity from 1.4 +/- 0.4 to 19.9 +/- 5 ng/ml/hr, ANF infusion induced an increase in plasma ANF levels and a reduction in blood pressure comparable to those observed in control conditions. During CEI, however, ANF infusion had no significant effect on the chronotropic baroreflex responses produced by phenylephrine or nitroglycerin. Chronotropic and pressor responses to cold exposure were unchanged after CEI and during ANF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In myocardial membranes from hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), there was a 37% increase of the Gi alpha-protein as measured by 32P-ADP-ribosylation of a approximately 40 kDa pertussis toxin substrate. Immunoblotting techniques also showed increased amounts of Gi alpha in DCM. In hearts with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), Gi alpha was not altered compared with nonfailing myocardium (NF). Basal and Gpp(NH)p-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was reduced in DCM but not in ICM. The number of beta-adrenoceptors was similarly reduced both in DCM and ICM compared with NF. Alterations of m-cholinoceptors or A1-adenosine receptors did not occur. Consistently, \"indirect\" negative inotropic effects of the m-cholinoceptor agonist carbachol and the A1-adenosine receptor agonist R-PIA were not different in ICM, DCM, and nonfailing myocardium. In ICM and DCM, there was a marked reduction of the positive inotropic responses to isoprenaline and milrinone. However, there was a further reduction in DCM compared with ICM. It is concluded that the increase of Gi alpha is accompanied by a reduction of basal and guanine-nucleotide-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Alterations of m-cholinoceptors and A1-adenosine receptors do not appear to be involved. The further decrease of the positive inotropic effects of isoprenaline and milrinone in DCM provides evidence that the increase of Gi alpha is functionally relevant in DCM but not ICM and hence might contribute to the reduced effects of endogenous catecholamines and exogenous cAMP-dependent positive inotropic agents in the former but not the latter condition.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of valproic acid hepatotoxicity has been reported to increase in patients who are receiving polytherapy. A minor valproic acid metabolite, 2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-ene-VPA), formed by a cytochrome P450-mediated reaction, has been shown to be a potent inducer of microvesicular steatosis in rats. This study tested the hypothesis that formation of 4-ene-VPA would be increased in patients taking valproic acid with carbamazepine or with phenytoin but decreased with coadministration of an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (the antiepileptic drug stiripentol in 300 to 1200 mg daily doses) in healthy subjects. Blood and urine samples in the studies were collected during a dosing interval at steady state. Valproic acid was assayed in plasma by capillary gas chromatography; valproic acid and 15 metabolites were measured in urine by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The formation clearance (CLf) of 4-ene-VPA was increased twofold in the valproic acid-carbamazepine and valproic acid-phenytoin groups. In the valproic acid/stiripentol studies, the CLf of 4-ene-VPA decreased by 32% in the 1200 mg/day stiripentol study. Similar findings were obtained at 600 and 300 mg/day stiripentol. These findings provide evidence supporting a role for cytochrome P450 in the formation of the hepatotoxic metabolite, 4-ene-VPA, in humans. The increased formation of 4-ene-VPA associated with carbamazepine and phenytoin is striking in relation to the epidemiologic finding of increased incidence of valproic acid-related hepatotoxicity during polytherapy with P450 inducers.\r"

Milk and blood samples were collected during the dosing period and for 2 days after the last dose. Concentrations of flecainide in milk and plasma were assayed by HPLC. Apparent steady-state levels of flecainide in both milk and plasma were achieved in most cases by day 4 of the study. Highest daily average concentration of flecainide in milk ranged from 270 to 1529 ng/ml for the 11 subjects. Mean +/- SD milk to plasma flecainide ratios were 3.7 +/- 3.5, 3.2 +/- 2.3, 3.5 +/- 2.1, and 2.6 +/- 0.7 on study days 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. After the last dose of flecainide, peak milk levels of the drug occurred at 3 to 6 hours and then declined monoexponentially. The half-life for elimination of flecainide from milk was 14.7 +/- 3.5 hours and is very similar to the plasma elimination half-life of flecainide in healthy human subjects. The mean milk to plasma ratios for flecainide after the last dose were 2.3 +/- 1.0 and 2.9 +/- 1.1 at 24 and 48 hours after the dose, respectively. Based on the pharmacokinetics of flecainide in infants, the expected average steady-state plasma concentration of flecainide in a newborn infant consuming all of the milk production of its mother (approximately 700 ml/day) would not be expected to exceed about 62 ng/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study examined the pattern of expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding the large (Gs alpha-L) and small (Gs alpha-S) molecular forms of Gs alpha in several rat tissues, including brown adipose tissue. In all tissues examined, Gs alpha-L mRNA was most abundant. This was most pronounced for brain tissue (95% of total), and least for brown adipose tissue (57%). The pattern of Gs alpha isoform expression of a given tissue was strongly correlated with the Gs alpha mRNA splicing pattern in that tissue. Cold exposure and surgical denervation are treatments that have been shown to, respectively, increase or decrease total Gs alpha mRNA in rat brown adipose tissue. Despite producing up to 4-fold differences in total Gs alpha mRNA, these treatments did not affect the proportions of Gs alpha mRNA splice variants in brown fat. In contrast, perinatal stimulation of brown fat was associated with changes in the splicing pattern of Gs alpha mRNA, and these changes were reflected in Gs alpha protein expression. Specifically, during the perinatal period Gs alpha-L mRNA increased significantly but Gs alpha-L protein levels did not change, whereas Gs alpha-S mRNA did not change and Gs alpha-S protein levels significantly declined. These data provide further evidence that the increased Gs alpha mRNA levels that occur in interscapular brown adipose tissue during periods of stimulation serve to maintain membrane levels of Gs alpha protein.\r"

  ".W": "This study examines the effect of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on preosteoblastic rat calvaria (RCT-1) cells, which acquire osteoblastic properties when treated with retinoic acid (RA). LIF potentiated the increase in alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity produced by RA. The LIF effect was time and dose dependent (EC50, approximately 1 pM). The earliest effects on AP activity were detected at 48 h, and maximal effects were observed after 72 h. RA increased AP mRNA about 2-fold at 3 h and 6-fold at 6 and 12 h. LIF further increased AP mRNA to 18-fold at 12 h. After RA treatment AP mRNA returned to control levels at 24 h, but in the presence of LIF, AP mRNA remained elevated at 24 and 72 h of treatment. When given alone, LIF had no effect on either AP activity or mRNA levels. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 also potentiated the RA induction of AP, and interleukin-6 had a small effect, whereas granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor had no effect. LIF alone had a small inhibitory effect on type 1 collagen mRNA, but did not oppose the stimulatory effect of RA. Consistent with these biological actions, LIF receptors were demonstrated on these cells. [125I]LIF bound to RCT-1 cells at 0 C with an apparent dissociation constant of 20 pM, and it was found that these cells express an average of 300 receptors/cell. Scatchard analyses showed a single class of high affinity binding site. LIF was internalized with an endocytic rate constant for occupied receptors of 0.03 min-1, and the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant at 37 C was 358 pM. These findings suggest that osteoblast precursor cells are among the target cells of LIF.\r"

  ".W": "This work investigated in rats whether passive immunization against the endogenous GHRF in the early postnatal period led to permanent alterations of somatotropic function, similar to those observed in several human growth disorders, e.g. constitutional growth delay (CGD). On postnatal days 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, rats were given an anti-GHRF-serum (GHRH-Ab, 100 microliters/rat, sc) and were tested 1, 30, and 60 days after this treatment for basal and GHRH-stimulated GH secretion both in vivo and in vitro. GHRH-Ab reduced both basal and GHRF-stimulated GH secretion at all intervals and induced marked and chronic impairment of growth rate. The following differences were observed in the GHRH-Ab treated rats compared to normal rabbit serum-treated controls: 1) GH biosynthesis (incorporation of L-[3H]leucine into the electrophoretic band of GH): reduction of about 70%, 1 day but not 30 days after treatment; 2) Pituitary weight: significant reduction in absolute weight (30-40%) at all posttreatment intervals, and relative weight, 1 and 30 days after treatment. 3) Pituitary GH concentration: significant reduction in GH content (about 40%) but not concentration, at all posttreatment intervals; 4) Percentage of somatotrophs (immunocytochemistry): about 40% reduction 1 day, but not 30 and 60 days after treatment; 5) Hypothalamic somatostatin messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in situ hybridization): selective reduction (40%) in the periventricular nucleus 1 day but not 30 days after treatment; 6) Hypothalamic somatostatin cell number (immunocytochemistry): no significant changes in any hypothalamic area at any interval; 7) Pituitary somatostatin binding (in situ autoradiography): significant reduction, 1 day and 30 days after treatment; 8) Somatostatin inhibition of GH release \"in vitro\": somatostatin effect on GH release was reduced 30 days after treatment. These and previous data indicate that: 1) Transient deprivation of GHRF in the immediate postnatal period of the rat leads to permanent impairment of growth rate and somatotropic function; 2) GHRF deficiency itself or through reduction of GH secretion impairs somatostatin functions temporarily in the hypothalamus and permanently in the pituitary; 3) This rat model may mimic some forms of growth disorders in humans and holds promise as useful tools for investigating the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "90382309\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies determined that iv nicotine stimulates ACTH secretion by acting on sites accessible from the fourth ventricle (IV), rather than directly on CRF-containing neurons in the hypothalamus. Brainstem catecholaminergic cell groups, which are accessible from the IV, project to the hypothalamus and stimulate the secretion of CRF and ACTH. Therefore, these studies investigated the role of catecholamines in nicotine-stimulated ACTH secretion. Experiments with the catecholaminergic neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine, demonstrate that the ACTH response to nicotine delivered iv (0.03 or 0.05 mg/kg body wt) or instilled into the IV (1 or 2.5 micrograms) was significantly reduced in lesioned animals (P less than 0.01). Selective inhibitors of epinephrine synthesis, SKF 64139 and 2,3-dichloro-alpha-methylbenzylamine (DCMB), significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) the ACTH response to 0.05 mg/kg body wt nicotine iv, without affecting median eminence CRF content. Because controversy exists about the effect of DCMB as an alpha 2 adrenoreceptor antagonist in vivo, this was examined by administering norepinephrine into the third ventricle after DCMB ip; DCMB significantly reduced the ACTH response to norepinephrine 0.2 micrograms (P less than 0.05) but not to 0.5 micrograms. To determine whether alpha 2 receptors are indeed involved in the ACTH response to nicotine, yohimbine, an alpha 2 antagonist, was injected into the third ventricle before nicotine injection into the IV. Yohimbine significantly reduced the ACTH response. Thus, the secretion of both hypothalamic epinephrine and, to some extent, norepinephrine is involved in the ACTH response to the activation of catecholaminergic neurons in the IV. Further investigation of the adrenergic receptor(s) involved compared the ACTH response to nicotine (1 microgram) instilled into the IV after prazocin (alpha 1 antagonist), or propranolol (beta antagonist) was injected into the third ventricle. Prazocin significantly reduced (P less than 0.05) the ACTH response, whereas propranolol was ineffective. Thus, both alpha 1 and alpha 2 receptors are involved in mediating the ACTH response to nicotine.\r"

Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)-like peptides could be demonstrated immunocytochemically in duck atria, but not in the salt glands. To elucidate the putative role of bird-specific ANF (cANF) in the control of salt gland function, conscious saltwater-acclimated Pekin ducks received 15 pmol/min.kg BW cANF for 10 min at two states of salt gland activity. During steady state diuresis and salt gland secretion induced by systemic infusion of 1.0 ml/min isotonic Krebs-Ringer solution, cANF applied iv enhanced the secretion rate from 0.20 to 0.29 ml/min and the osmolality of secretion from 870 to 920 mosmol/kg. At threshold conditions of salt gland activity, cANF infused intracarotideally stimulated the secretion rate from 0.07 to 0.15 ml/min at elevated osmolality of 760 compared to 480 mosmol/kg. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate remained unchanged. Receptor autoradiography with [125I]Bolton-Hunter-cANF as ligand demonstrated specific binding sites throughout the salt gland tissue of both freshwater and saltwater ducks. Scatchard analysis using an enriched membrane fraction revealed high affinity (Kd = 0.9 nM) binding sites of 270 fmol/mg protein density. Displacement studies with unlabeled cANF and human ANF showed comparable Ki values for both peptides in freshwater and saltwater ducks. The combined results indicate an important role for cANF in the control of avian salt gland function.\r"

  ".W": "It is widely accepted that expression of protooncogenes is coupled with cellular proliferation and differentiation. Since ACTH stimulates not only steroidogenesis but also cellular proliferation, we investigated whether ACTH affects the expression of c-fos, c-myc, and beta-actin genes. The effect of ACTH on adrenal glands was studied in hypophysectomized rats. Changes in the mRNA levels were studied by Northern and dot blot analyses. It was demonstrated that ACTH induces increases in mRNAs encoding c-fos and beta-actin in adrenal glands of hypophysectomized rats. When stimulated by ACTH (5 IU/100 g BW), the mRNA levels of both genes increase rapidly; the maximum levels are observed at 30 min for c-fos and 6 h for beta-actin. Both mRNAs declined to near-control levels by 6-24 h. The levels of mRNAs encoding cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 and 21-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450 began to increase 3 and 12 h after ACTH administration, respectively. This increase continued for 24 h after ACTH treatment. Increases in total adrenal RNA and adrenal weight occurred slowly after ACTH treatment. On the other hand, the levels of c-myc mRNA were very low and were not increased by ACTH administration. These results suggest that increased expression of c-fos and beta-actin genes by ACTH may have important roles in mediating its action on adrenals.\r"

In the proximal colon, daily administration of EGF for 1, 3, or 5 days postpartum inhibited the postnatal increase in lactase, maltase, and aminopeptidase specific activities. In contrast, in the jejunum EGF did not influence lactase activity, inconsistently increased maltase activity, and partly prevented the early postnatal decrease in aminopeptidase activity. In the proximal colon, EGF showed additive effects with T4 and hydrocortisone on the inhibition of lactase activity. In the jejunum, EGF potentiated the effect of hydrocortisone and T4 on the expression of sucrase activity and had only a slight effect when injected alone. The incorporation rate of [3H]thymidine in the proximal colon and jejunum was not different in control and treated rats, indicating the absence of an effect of EGF on DNA synthesis. These results show that EGF may play an important physiological role in the enzymatic differentiation of the developing intestine during early postnatal development. Alone or acting with T4 or glucocorticoids, EGF may induce the decline of digestive hydrolases in the proximal colon. In the small intestine EGF may play a major role in the triggering of sucrase expression.\r"

  ".W": "The phospholipid platelet-activating factor (PAF) (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) stimulated the accumulation of inositol phosphates in cultures of rat and bovine anterior pituitary cells. In response to PAF, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate showed the largest percent increase of the inositol phosphates in the presence of lithium chloride. PAF induced an increase of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, the biologically active isomer responsible for mobilization of intracellular calcium. A characterization of the PAF response indicated that PAF, but not its biologically inactive enantiomer, induced the accumulation of inositol phosphates in the rat anterior pituitary. Further, the PAF receptor antagonist L652731 reduced PAF stimulation. The ED50 for PAF-induced inositol 1,4-bisphosphate accumulation was 0.4 nM. PAF induced a rapid response that did not persist beyond 20 min. While PAF treatment of anterior pituitary cells did not alter TRH-induced inositol phosphate accumulation, it did prevent a second exposure of PAF from inducing inositol phosphate accumulation. These data suggest that PAF induces a rapid stimulation of phospholipase C causing the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and the generation of the second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diglyceride, in anterior pituitary tissue. This action is transient probably due to PAF receptor desensitization. The action of PAF on generation of inositol phosphates may account, in part, for PAF-induced secretion of PRL and GH.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the role of cAMP-mediated signal transduction processes in mediation of secretagogue-stimulated GH release, we examined the dose-related effects of the diterpene adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (FSK) in primary monolayer cultures of rat adenohypophyseal cells. In cell cultures prepared from both immature (12 days old) and adult (6 weeks to 4 months old) male or female rats, the dose-related stimulation of GH release by FSK was biphasic. With increasing FSK concentrations from 0.03-3.16 microM, GH release increased progressively to maximal values of 442 +/- 19% and 303 +/- 10% of basal release in cells from immature and adult rats, respectively. FSK concentrations above 3.16 microM induced progressively diminished GH responses, with net inhibition to below basal release evident at 100 microM FSK. FSK stimulated PRL release to a lesser degree than it did GH release; the PRL response to FSK was also biphasic. When maximal stimulatory concentrations (Emax) of FSK and GH-releasing factor (GRF; 10 nM) were added in combination, the GH response was significantly less than the individual response to either secretagogue alone. In response to FSK alone, GRF alone, and FSK plus GRF, GH release was 478 +/- 7%, 583 +/- 11%, and 244 +/- 5%; 278 +/- 4%, 283 +/- 3%, and 175 +/- 2%; and 299 +/- 12%, 351 +/- 5%, and 191 +/- 17% of basal release in cells from 12-day-old, adult male, and adult female rats, respectively (P less than 0.01 for all responses to combined addition vs. the individual responses). Submaximal stimulatory concentrations of GRF added in combination with submaximal FSK elicited partially additive GH responses; the GH response to Emax GRF, on the other hand, was inhibited in a dose-related manner by all concentrations of FSK that by themselves were stimulatory. The GH responses were also suppressed when Emax FSK was added to cultured cells of 12-day-old rats in combination with Emax cholera toxin (2.5 ng/ml) or prostaglandin E2 (10 microM), agents whose actions, like that of GRF, involve adenylate cyclase activation. In contrast, FSK did not suppress but in most cases augmented the maximal GH responses to secretagogues whose action is independent of adenylate cyclase activation: (Bu)2cAMP (0.5 mM), TRH (100 nM), phorbol myristate acetate (50 nM), the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (250 microM), and the dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel agonist BAY K8644 (10 microM). Indeed, combined addition of FSK with the latter two agents resulted in synergistic stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

However, calcium per se is not the mediator of the antigonadotropic action of PGF2a. Thapsigargin, a plant sesquiterpene lactone, increases intracellular calcium concentration concentration ([Ca]i) in several cell types by a mechanism that involves specific inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2(+)-ATPase. To further investigate the antigonadotropic role of [Ca]i and the mechanism of action of PGF2a in rat luteal cells, the action of thapsigargin on cellular functional responses was examined in the absence and presence of PGF2a. Thapsigargin dose dependently increased [Ca]i and inhibited cAMP accumulation and progesterone production in response to LH. The inhibitory effect of thapsigargin on cAMP accumulation was calcium dependent but in contrast, inhibition of LH-stimulated progesterone production was independent of calcium mobilization by thapsigargin. Steroidogenesis stimulated by (Bu)2cAMP was also inhibited by thapsigargin. Thus, thapsigargin mimicked some effects of PGF2a with inhibitory sites of action on both cAMP accumulation and progesterone production. Thapsigargin also blocked the mobilization of [Ca]i by PGF2a, but when coincubated with PGF2a an additive effect on inhibition of LH-stimulated progesterone production occurred. However, no additive effects of thapsigargin and PGF2a on gonadotropin-sensitive cAMP accumulation were evident. In conclusion, although thapsigargin and PGF2a may share some similar actions, their antigonadotropic effects are mediated differently.\r"

The intense immunohistochemical staining for MIS seen in fetal and newborn testes began to decrease gradually after the third postnatal day, then decreased dramatically on the fifth postnatal day. MIS immunohistochemical activity was then present at a low level until about the 20th postnatal day, after which it was barely detectable. The testes from rats treated with FSH at birth showed a considerable drop in MIS immunohistochemical activity on the third postnatal day to 29% of control testes, and a less profound decrease on the second and fourth postnatal days to 46% and 61% of control, respectively; thereafter MIS levels were the same in treated and untreated animals. With shorter courses of FSH treatment, immunohistochemical staining showed less depression of MIS on the third day, and no difference by the fourth postnatal day, indicating that the inhibitory effect on testicular MIS production may require continued FSH exposure. Three-day testes that had been treated with FSH for 2-1/2 days had less MIS messenger RNA compared to control testes of the same age, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of FSH on MIS production could be transcriptionally mediated. In contrast LH treatment produced no difference in either messenger RNA expression or immunohistochemical staining for MIS. These findings suggested that FSH may be a modulator of MIS production in neonatal testes.\r"

Low concentrations (1-100 pM) of these peptides caused a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i, whereas high concentrations (up to 100 nM) caused a large transient elevation of [Ca2+]i that was followed by a lower sustained plateau. Experiments with protein kinase C-depleted cells suggested that phorbol diester-sensitive protein kinase C was not involved in the transition of [Ca2+]i from spike to plateau seen with high concentrations of secretagogue. Specific concentrations of secretagogue mobilized different pools of [Ca2+]i, as indicated by experiments with Ca2(+)-depleted medium. Low concentrations of secretagogue induced a Ca2+ response that was abolished by Ca2(+)-depleted medium, whereas high concentrations generated a [Ca2+]i response that was refractory to Ca2(+)-depleted medium. Dopamine (100 nM) abolished the [Ca2+]i plateau response to all four agents at low concentrations and selectively reduced the plateau component of the responses elicited at high concentrations of secretagogue. If the plateau component is represented by utilization of either extracellular Ca2+ or a cell-associated EGTA-accessible pool(s) of Ca2+, then dopamine modulates one or both of these calcium sources.\r"

  ".W": "The insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) and lysosomal enzymes containing a mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) recognition site bind to different sites of the same receptor molecule. We have observed that M6P increases the receptor-mediated uptake of IGF-II into IM-9 cells. We now confirm this phenomenon in a different line, the H-35 rat hepatoma cells, and present additional characterization of the underlying mechanisms. When incubated in the presence of radiolabeled IGF-II, H-35 cells accumulated, in a time-dependent fashion, radioactivity that was resistant to removal by trypsin digestion at 15 C, indicating that it was endocytosed. In the presence of 3 mM M6P, endocytosed counts were approximately 2-fold higher after 5 min of incubation, an enhancement that peaked at 10 min, then declined, but was still evident after 40 min (1.5-fold). The rate of release of cell-associated IGF-II, degraded or intact, as measured in a chase experiment, was not affected by M6P. These observations indicate that M6P increased accumulation of IGF-II by accelerating its rate of endocytosis rather than by interfering with IGF-II degradation or with the recycling of intact hormone-receptor complexes to the cell surface. Electrophoresis after affinity cross-linking of labeled cells demonstrated that the enhancement in radioactivity could be located at a molecular size of approximately 250 kDa, corresponding to IGF-II-receptor complexes. Preincubation with M6P did not significantly alter the specific binding of IGF-II to the cell surface of H-35 cells, as measured by a binding assay at 4 C. Finally, pretreatment with cycloheximide for up to 8 h, to remove all newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes bound to the M6P/IGF-II receptor, did not affect IGF-II endocytosis beyond what could be accounted for by some loss of receptor, suggesting that the observed effect of M6P is due to the binding of M6P itself to the receptor and not to displacement of lysosomal enzymes. We conclude that simultaneous occupancy of the M6P/IGF-II receptor by ligands on both binding sites enhances its rate of endocytosis.\r"

  ".W": "A tissue-slicing method has been developed for obtaining quantitative information relative to the function and distribution of somatotrophs in the individual pituitary of the male rat. The adenohypophysis was cut along midtransverse, coronal, and sagittal planes, dividing the gland into eight distinct slices. Basal (unstimulated) GH release was measured from sections placed in gyrotory incubation for three consecutive periods (20 min each). Response to rat hypothalamic GH-releasing hormone (rhGHRH) was studied in slices placed in perifusion and in dispersed cells placed in static incubation. Tissues and cells were analyzed by light and electron microscopy and flow cytometry. Cells retained good morphological integrity and viability (greater than 85%) after incubation (1 h) or perifusion (5 h). Somatotrophs were evenly distributed sagittally and rostrocaudally, but were unevenly distributed dorsoventrally; mean values for dorsal and ventral sections were 45.3 +/- 2.5% and 38.9 +/- 1.9%, respectively. Differential basal GH release was observed after the first gyrotory incubation period; values differed by as much as 3-fold. These differences became less apparent with subsequent incubations. Pituitary slices in perifusion showed a differential response to rhGHRH. For some sections GH release increased up to 2-fold; in other sections the response was either negligible or absent. Dissociated cells from sections also showed differential response to rhGHRH; increases ranged from 160-250% above unstimulated values. These studies demonstrate that tissue slicing is a useful method for investigating pituitary cell function in vitro. The correlation between function and position suggests that heterogeneity of somatotrophs is related in part to their location in the gland.\r"

  ".W": "The insulin receptor was immunoprecipitated from cultured human lymphocytes (IM-9) and rat hepatocytes (Fao) after biosynthetic labeling with [3H]glucosamine or [3H]mannose, and the nature of the carbohydrate units was investigated. Digestion of the receptor from IM-9 lymphocytes with E. freundii endo-beta-galactosidase increased the migration of the insulin receptor alpha- and beta-subunits on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and sharpened the electrophoretic bands; the alpha-subunit was converted from an apparent mol wt (Mr) of 123,000 to a Mr of 118,000, and the beta-subunit from a Mr of 92,000 to 89,000. The susceptibility of the insulin receptor to this enzyme indicates that its carbohydrate units contain poly-N-acetyllactosamine sequences. Affinity chromatography of receptor glycopeptides on Concanavalin-A-Sepharose revealed that the poly-N-acetyllactosamine units were attached to multiantennary glycopeptides that accounted for over 75% of the [3H]glucosamine incorporated into the IM-9 lymphocyte insulin receptor; the remaining radioactivity was present in polymannose units (primarily Man8GlcNAc2) and biantennary complex saccharides. Several differences in the carbohydrate chains of the insulin receptor from the Fao and IM-9 cells indicated that glycosylation was cell specific despite the occurrence of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains in both cell types. The IM-9 lymphocyte receptor glycopeptides were larger (Mr, 3,200-9,500) and more susceptible to endo-beta-galactosidase than those from the Fao receptor (Mr, 3,000-5,000). Moreover, the released saccharides from the Fao receptor were found by exoglycosidase digestions and chromatographic comparison to standards to contain terminal sialic acid in both alpha 2----3 and alpha 2----6 linkage to galactose, whereas the IM-9 carbohydrate units contained only alpha 2----3-linked sialic acid.\r"

  ".U": "90382339\r", 
  ".W": "The vectorial secretion of immunoactive and bioactive inhibin by immature rat Sertoli cells (Sc) cultured in a two-compartment system was investigated using various culture supports. When Sc were cultured on Millipore-HA filters (used in all previous studies on vectorial secretion of inhibin), both immuno- and bioactive inhibin were found almost exclusively in the apical compartment, suggesting predominantly apical secretion of the glycoprotein. However, the cell-free Millipore-HA filters completely blocked the passage of Sc-conditioned medium (SCCM) inhibin, even after pretreatment with BSA and SCCM to saturate the protein-binding sites. On the other hand, polycarbonate Nucleopore filters or Millicell-CM membranes, both exhibiting extremely low protein-binding capacity, did not significantly block the passage of SCCM inhibin. When Sc were cultured on Nucleopore filters, the immunoactive inhibin was detected in both culture compartments; the basal compartment/apical compartment (BC/AC) ratio was about 1.5 (range, 1.2-1.9). The maximal effective dose of FSH or (Bu)2cAMP caused a 6- to 9-fold increase in the total (BC plus AC) secretion of immunoactive inhibin, but only a 60% increase in the secretion of bioactive inhibin, as evaluated by RIA and pituitary cell bioassay, respectively. The latter phenomenon was not accompanied by any significant change in the basal/apical distribution of either bioactive nor immunoactive inhibin. The presence of testosterone alone (10(-6) M) did not affect either total immunoactive inhibin secretion or its BC/AC ratio. The effects of the concomitant presence of FSH and testosterone did not differ significantly from those of FSH alone. Similarly to testosterone, the lack of any significant effect was observed for 17 beta-estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, androstenediol, and androstenedione regardless of the presence or absence of FSH. The striking dissimilarity of BC/AC ratios of inhibin noted in cultures maintained on Millipore-HA and Nucleopore filters was not due to differences in permeability barrier or Sc functional polarity. When cultured on either support, Sc monolayers developed comparable permeability barriers, as evaluated by measuring the passage of [3H]inulin and development of electrical resistance. The maximal electrical resistance (130-150 omega cm2) developed after 6-8 days of culture on either support. Also, total transferrin secretion and transferrin BC/AC ratio were similar on both supports, suggesting comparable cell numbers and functional polarities. These findings demonstrate that immature Sc in vitro secrete inhibin bidirectionally (BC/AC ratio, approximately 1.5); the polarity of secretion is unaffected by either FSH or various naturally occurring steroids, including testosterone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Studies using cultured bovine adrenocortical cells now demonstrate that the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha and beta, contrary to previous reports, can stimulate cortisol secretion in vitro in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. However detectable levels of IL-1 receptor could not be demonstrated in adrenal cortical, medullary, or capsular cells by membrane displacement of iodinated IL-1 alpha by unlabeled IL-1 beta, a technique that readily demonstrates specific IL-1 alpha-binding sites on 3T3 fibroblasts. The stimulatory effect of IL-1 on cortisol secretion could be totally blocked by indomethacin, an indication that this effect might be mediated indirectly via local release of prostaglandins (PGs). Subsequent investigations have confirmed that IL-1 does enhance the conversion of [3H]arachidonate to PGs by cultured adrenal cells, and that some of these PGs (PGD2, PGF2 alpha, and PGE2), in turn, can stimulate cortisol production. Taken together these observations suggest that IL-1-induced stimulation of cortisol secretion is mediated through local release of PGs by a small subpopulation of cells within the adrenal gland.\r"

  ".U": "90382347\r", 
  ".W": "Studies were performed to determine whether the isolated ovine anterior and intermediate pituitary might rhythmically secrete three POMC peptides, ACTH, ir-beta-endorphin (ir-beta-EP), and ir-alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (ir-alpha-MSH) in vivo. When blood was taken at 10-min intervals from four ewes with hypothalamo-pituitary-disconnection (HPD), a distinct POMC-peptide and cortisol ultradian rhythm was noted. A comparison of the four HPD ewes with five nonstressed hypothalamopituitary-intact (HPI) ewes revealed that the mean plasma levels of the three POMC-peptides and cortisol were increased, the mean ACTH and ir-alpha-MSH pulse amplitudes were increased, and the mean ir-beta-EP and ir-alpha-MSH interpulse intervals were decreased. When four HPI ewes were subjected to a mild stress, plasma POMC-peptide and cortisol levels increased significantly when compared with the five unstressed HPI animals. In addition, the ACTH and cortisol pulse amplitudes increased and the ir-beta-EP and ir-alpha-MSH interpulse intervals decreased. Although plasma ACTH levels in the stressed HPI and HPD ewes were comparable, mean plasma cortisol levels were 2-fold greater in the stressed HPI animals. To determine whether the ACTH hypersecretion in the HPD ewe might reflect a net reduction in hypothalamic inhibitory influence over ACTH secretion, we examined the effects of dopamine (DA), somatostatin (SS-14), and rat atrial natriuretic peptide [rANF(1-28)] on the secretion of ACTH from cultured ovine anterior pituitary cells. DA and SS-14 did not exert a discernible effect on basal, CRF-, or arginine vasopressin (AVP)-stimulated ACTH secretion. Although basal ACTH secretion was unaffected by rANF(1-28) (10(-12)-10(-8) M), a significant inhibition of CRF- and AVP-stimulated ACTH release was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90382349\r", 
  ".W": "Based on the deduced amino acid sequence of rat TRH prohormone (pro-TRH), proteolytic processing of this polyprotein precursor is expected to produce, beside TRH, several other novel peptides. These peptides should correspond to connecting segments flanking the repeated TRH progenitor sequence and to various C- and/or N-terminally extended forms of TRH. The profile of the endogenous products of the TRH system was studied in rat brain using multiple RIAs coupled to molecular sieve filtration and HPLC separations. In extracts from the rat hypothalamus, TRH and two pro-TRH-connecting peptides, prepro-TRH-(160-169) and prepro-TRH-(178-199) were detected in molar ratios corresponding to those expected for a nearly complete processing of the prohormone molecule. In the olfactory bulb, pro-TRH is processed differently, since peptides containing TRH at their N-termini, [pGlu172] prepro-TRH-(172-199) and [pGlu154]prepro-TRH-(154-169), were found to be major end products along with prepro-TRH-(160-169) and prepro-TRH-(178-199). The dissimilarity in tissue content suggests that differential processing of TRH precursor by various enzymatic pathways may act as a regulating mechanism for TRH and TRH-related activities. The cellular localization of C-terminally extended forms of TRH in rat olfactory bulb was examined by the indirect immunoperoxidase method, using antisera directed against prepro-TRH-(160-169) and pre-pro-TRH-(178-199). Cell bodies and nerve fibers were detected in the glomerular and external plexiform layers of the main olfactory bulb. The presence of extended forms of TRH in interneurons and middle tufted cells of the main olfactory bulb suggests that in light of the recent biological properties described for prepro-TRH-(160-169), these peptides may act as neuromodulators for olfactory epithelium inputs or neurotransmitters within more rostrally located olfactory areas in the forebrain.\r"

  ".U": "90382352\r", 
  ".W": "Endothelin (ET-1) is a pleiotropic regulatory peptide which exerts multiple endocrine actions on the cardiovascular system. In the present study, we have investigated the possible role of ET-1 in the regulation of adrenocortical cells using perifused frog interrenal (adrenal) slices. Graded doses of ET-1 from 10(-11)-10(-9) M stimulated both corticosterone and aldosterone production in a dose-dependent manner. Repeated 20-min pulses of ET-1 (10(-9) M), given at the frequency of one pulse per 90 min, resulted in a marked reduction of the secretory response after the second pulse. Prolonged administration (3 h) of ET-1 induced a rapid increase in corticosterone and aldosterone output, followed by a gradual decline of corticosteroid secretion. Perifusion of frog adrenal tissue with ET-1 (10(-9) M) caused a significant increase in the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, the stable metabolite of the prostacyclin PGI2. The enhancement of PG biosynthesis preceded by 10 min the peak of corticosteroids. When repeated pulses of ET-1 were administered, a significant diminution of the production of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was observed after the second pulse. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (5 microM) totally suppressed the stimulatory effect of ET-1 on corticosterone and aldosterone secretion; in contrast, indomethacin did not affect ACTH-evoked corticosteroid secretion. Perifusion of adrenal slices with a calcium-free solution or addition of cobalt (4 mM) induced total inhibition of the stimulatory effect of ET-1. These results demonstrate that ET-1 is a potent stimulator of corticosterone and aldosterone secretion from frog adrenal gland in vitro. Our data show that repeated or prolonged administration of ET-1 induces a rapid desensitization phenomenon. The data also indicate that ET-1-evoked corticosteroid secretion is mediated by an increase in PG biosynthesis and requires the presence of extracellular calcium.\r"

The observers also classified the seizures as generalized from onset, undetermined, or partial secondarily generalized. To assess the accuracy of the classification, we obtained a standard EEG, an EEG after partial sleep deprivation, a computed tomography (CT) scan, and a follow-up report after 1 year. The subclassification on clinical grounds of a generalized first seizure is too unreliable and probably too invalid as well to be useful in clinical practice or in epidemiologic research.\r"

The interictal EEG shows slow, disphasic, high-voltage spikes in the centrotemporal areas. The few published examples of ictal tracings depict focal rhythmic sharp waves and spikes without significant postictal slowing. We report an ictal event in BECTS that is unusual in the evolution and polarity of the ictal discharges. In this subclinical seizure, ictal multiple spike and wave discharges appear as a dipole: they are electropositive in T3-C3 and negative in F3. These surface positive epileptic discharges are unique and require explanation. We postulate that the seizure discharge arises in the depths of the sylvian fissure involving folded cortical areas. This occurs in such a way that the negative component of the discharges is concealed from the scalp electrodes. Thus, a relative positivity is recorded on the surface. This represents a dipole reversal relative to the interictal discharges (characteristic of BECTS). This geometrical explanation allows us to avoid postulating an unusual mechanism of generation of this seizure.\r"

A control group of 25 patients continued with existing therapy. A simple test battery, which would be directly applicable to a clinical setting, with measures of mental speed, attention, performance of a learned skill, short-term memory, concentration, and simple coordinated hand movements was used. Cognitive assessments were made before and at the end of discontinuation of a drug and 4 weeks later. Simple motor skills became faster on discontinuation of PHT, CBZ, and VPA (p less than 0.0005), with a further improvement in the subsequent 4 weeks (p = 0.03) and no significant difference between the AEDs. Performance on a measure of attention and concentration improved on discontinuation of PHT (p = 0.005) and did not alter with removal of CBZ or VPA; the improvement in the PHT discontinuation group was significantly different from that in the control group (p = 0.001). These results suggest that all three AEDs studied may adversely affect motor function and that PHT may be more deleterious to function in higher cognitive tasks than in CBZ or VPA.\r"

We have studied 19 chronic liver disease patients, 13 without (group 1) and six with (group 2) histories of clinical sodium retention (ascites or edema) by varying dietary sodium intake. The patients were placed on a 20 mmol/day constant diet for 1 wk, followed by a constant 100 mmol/day sodium diet for 1 wk under strict metabolic conditions. After 5 days of equilibration on each diet, blood and urine samples were collected for plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels and urinary sodium excretion. Group 1 patients (n = 6) achieved near sodium balance in 5 days on both a 20-mmol (urinary sodium output = 17 +/- 3 mmol/day) and a 100-mmol sodium diet (urinary sodium output = 80 +/- 5 mmol/day). Atrial natriuretic factor levels in these patients tended to be elevated, but the increase was not significantly greater than that in normal control subjects (10 +/- 4 pg/ml to 19 +/- 4 pg/ml) on the same diets. In contrast, group 2 patients (n = 5) were in significant positive sodium balance on both the 20 mmol/day sodium diet (mean urinary sodium output = 9.5 +/- 3.3 mol/day) and the 100 mmol/day sodium diet (urinary sodium output = 37 +/- 13 mmol/day).

No significant differences were seen between healthy subjects and compensated cirrhotic patients in any of these parameters (sodium and potassium-activated ATPase inhibition = 178.5 +/- 19.8 vs. 247.4 +/- 48.7 nmol equivalent of ouabain/day; digoxinlike activity = 43.9 +/- 6.1 vs. 48.0 +/- 5.6 ng equivalent of digoxin/day; natriuretic activity = 0.36 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.63 +/- 0.27 mumol/min). Cirrhotic patients with ascites with and without functional renal failure showed significantly higher values of sodium and potassium-activated ATPase inhibition (708.1 +/- 94.0 and 529.2 +/- 53.9 nmol equivalent of ouabain/day, respectively), digoxinlike activity (136.9 +/- 7.2 and 116.3 +/- 7.9 ng equivalent of digoxin/day) and natriuretic activity (1.78 +/- 0.48 and 1.93 +/- 0.37 mumol/min) than healthy subjects and compensated cirrhotic patients. We saw no significant differences between these two groups of cirrhotic patients with ascites with respect to these parameters. In the cirrhotic patients studied, sodium and potassium-activated ATPase inhibition and antidigoxin antibodies directly correlated with the degree of impairment of hepatic and renal function, plasma renin activity and plasma levels of aldosterone and norepinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, short-term primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, maintained in a serum-free, hormonally defined medium without dexamethasone and cultured on a fibronectin-collagen type IV substratum, were used. Primary and passage 1 and 2 cultures of fat-storing cells maintained on tissue culture plastic were also studied. Hepatocytes produced significant amounts of collagen type III, but formation of collagen type I was not detectable. Laminin and collagen type IV production were very low. Hepatocytes maintained their ability to metabolize ethanol (at levels comparable to those observed at 2 hr) for at least 48 hr after plating and this metabolism was inhibited 86% to 95% by 4-methylpyrazole (1 mmol/L). Neither ethanol (50 mmol/L) nor acetaldehyde (175 mumol/L, initial concentration) had any effect on the production of collagen type III or laminin. Fat-storing cells (95% to 100% desmin-positive) produced significant amounts of both type I and type III collagen. Production of collagen type IV and laminin was very low. Metabolism of ethanol by these cultures was not detected. Addition of ethanol had no effect on collagen or laminin production in fat-storing cells. In contrast, acetaldehyde significantly increased the production of collagen type I, but did not alter the production of collagen type III, IV or laminin. Incorporation of 3H-proline into total protein was not affected by addition of ethanol or acetaldehyde to fat-storing cells or hepatocytes. Exposure of fat-storing cells to ethanol or acetaldehyde did not change 3H-collagen degrading activity in the media.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Imaging studies demonstrated a large retroperitoneal mass; a laparotomy was performed. At surgery, the mesentery was greatly thickened by neurofibromas, and plexiform neurofibroma extended through the hilum of the liver. Light and electron microscopy demonstrated that in addition to the direct involvement by tumor, neural hyperplasia existed throughout the liver. The most distal ramifications of the portal spaces were filled with Schwann cells, bundles of unmyelinated nerves and perineurium-surrounded nerves containing myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. The ultrastructural findings were consistent with stimulation of proliferation of all the portal neural elements and tumoral tissue. The nontumoral response was more than simple hyperplasia because it appeared to result in fibrotic changes in the most involved areas and active breaching of the limiting plate with destruction of hepatocytes and collagen deposition throughout the liver.\r"

We conducted a retrospective study to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C antibody in the sera of 59 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were HBsAg-negative and had no evidence of alcoholic liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis or alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Twenty patients (34%) were hepatitis C antibody-positive and hepatitis B core antibody-negative. All twenty patients had underlying cirrhosis, and seven (35%) had histories of transfusions. Eleven (19%) additional patients were also hepatitis C antibody-positive but were hepatitis B core antibody-positive as well. Twenty-one (36%) patients were both hepatitis C antibody- and hepatitis B core antibody-negative and seven (12%) were hepatitis C antibody-negative but hepatitis B core antibody-positive. The prevalence of hepatitis C antibody was also determined among three other population groups serving as controls and found to be 14% in 28 HbsAg-positive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 44% in 76 patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis and 0.5% in 200 consecutive volunteer blood donors. We conclude that hepatitis C antibody is prevalent among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and may therefore be a common causative agent of this disease. A significant number of patients with and without cirrhosis, negative for hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis B core antibody, remain without a discernible cause for this malignancy. Perhaps a second- or third-generation test will detect hepatitis C antibody in some of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The exact relationship between depression and chronic headache remains unclear. Considerable clinical and pharmacological evidence suggests the existence of a common biological terrain. Many antidepressant drugs are effective in the treatment of migraine and chronic headache disorders. Ritanserin, a new very selective serotonin-2 (5-HT2) antagonist, has recently shown both analgesic and antidepressant properties. The present study compares in a double-blind design, the effectiveness of ritanserin and amitriptyline, a well-known antidepressant extensively used in migraine prophylaxis. Thirty-eight patients (30 females and 8 males ranging in age from 20 to 50 yrs) were classified according to the International Headache Society criteria as: patients with chronic tension-type headache (CTH) (11 cases) and patients with coexisting migraine and CTH (MCTH) (27 cases). Only patients with a score equal to or higher than 18 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) were included. Ritanserin was highly effective in reducing Pain Total Index and analgesic consumption in chronic headache, and its activity was similar to that observed during amitriptyline treatment. A significant improvement of HRSD and HRSA (Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety) scores was observed during both treatments. The main results of our study concern the demonstration of antiheadache and antidepressive properties of ritanserin. To better define the profile of the patients and their clinical responsiveness to the treatment, dexamethasone suppression test, clonidine test and nociceptive flexion reflex were investigated in our patients. Our data confirm the usefulness of these methods as markers of chronic headache with depression.\r"

  ".W": "Serum bioactive (B) LH concentrations increase with each pubertal stage and exceed immunoreactive (I) measurements in boys and girls throughout puberty. These results have been attributed to increased GnRH secretion and/or sex steroid modulation. FSH secretion is likewise affected by these factors. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that serum B-FSH concentrations would increase with each stage of puberty in boys and girls. In this study we compared the serum concentrations of B-FSH, I-FSH, and sex steroids and stages of puberty (determined according to Tanner) in 111 sera obtained from boys and girls from 6-18 yr of age with the results obtained from 6 young men under the age of 35 yr and 13 cycling women (studied during the follicular, periovulatory, and luteal phases of their menstrual cycles). The serum I-FSH, testosterone (T), and estradiol (E2) concentrations were determined by RIAs, and B-FSH was determined by the rat Sertoli cell aromatase induction assay. The results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test for each gender and two-way analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test for comparison of the results between sexes. In boys the mean serum T concentrations increased progressively with each stage of pubertal development up to Tanner stage 4 (P less than 0.01). The mean serum I-FSH concentration at Tanner stage 1 was 0.7 +/- 0.1 ng/mL (hFSH-3) and did not change significantly until Tanner stage 4, when it was increased to 3.7 +/- 1.0 ng/mL (P less than 0.05). The mean serum I-FSH concentrations for Tanner stage 5 and adult men were not statistically different, but were lower than in Tanner stage 4. Mean serum B-FSH concentrations measured with the same standard were 1.9 +/- 0.4, 3.1 +/- 0.4, 2.7 +/- 0.4, 4.2 +/- 1.4, and 3.6 +/- 0.3 ng/mL in Tanner stages 1-5, respectively. These were not significantly different. In girls the mean serum E2 concentrations increased progressively between the Tanner stages (P less than 0.00005, by two-way analysis of variance). Mean serum I-FSH levels did not change significantly with the achievement of different pubertal stages. The mean B-FSH concentrations were 2.7 +/- 0.4, 2.8 +/- 0.5, 3.8 +/- 0.8, 2.8 +/- 0.7, and 3.9 +/- 0.6 ng/mL at Tanner stages 1-5, respectively, and were, likewise, not statistically significantly different. In adult women the mean serum B-FSH concentrations during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle were not significantly different from pubertal values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

There was a positive correlation (r = 0.902) between basal GH and free T4 levels. Twenty-four-hour plasma GH and urinary GH excretion both increased during the thyrotoxic state. Intravenous administration of TRH induced a marked increase in plasma GH levels during euthyroidism and a modest increase when the patient was hyperthyroid, whereas GH release induced by GH-releasing hormone was not altered by thyroid status. These findings suggest that hyperthyroidism stimulated spontaneous GH secretion from the pituitary adenoma, but inhibited the stimulating effect of TRH.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined, using the same system of human thyroid cells in culture, the effects of the cytokine human gamma-interferon (gamma IFN) on the expression of DR antigen, cell pro-liferation, cAMP accumulation, and the differentiated functions, iodide uptake and T3 secretion. gamma IFN elicited a dose- and time-dependent increase in DR expression, with a maximum effect on day 5 of culture. The cytokine, at the same concentrations and experimental conditions as those found to be effective in inducing DR antigen expression, caused on day 5 of culture a dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation, DNA content, cell count, as well as TSH-stimulated (but not basal) iodide uptake and T3 secretion. The gamma IFN suppressive influence on the differentiated functions was not merely due to a reduction in cell number, but was also apparent when results were expressed per micrograms DNA. Since the cytokine did not inhibit TSH- or forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation and showed a suppressive influence toward 8-bromo-cAMP- and forskolin-stimulated T3 secretion, its inhibitory effect seems to be exerted at a site located distal to cAMP formation. Although gamma IFN alone was devoid of any effect on cAMP accumulation, it enhanced forskolin-stimulated (as well as TSH-activated) cAMP in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, an inhibitor of cAMP degradation. Thus, it would seem that gamma IFN also exerts an influence on cAMP formation (rather than degradation) at a step subsequent to TSH binding to its receptor. The effects we observed seem specific to gamma IFN, since alpha IFN, although capable of inhibiting human thyrocyte multiplication, lacked any influence on DR antigen expression, cAMP accumulation, or T3 secretion by human thyroid cells. In what way, if any, is gamma IFN-induced DR antigen expression on human thyrocytes, an event believed to be critical in the pathophysiology of autoimmune thyroid disease, related to decreased thyroid function and growth is presently unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Gonadotroph adenomas may exhibit qualitative and quantitative defects in gonadotropin biosynthesis and secretion. Hypersecretion of immunoreactive FSH dimers by these adenomas occurs frequently; however, it has not been known whether this FSH is biologically active. Using the granulosa cell aromatase bioassay and a highly specific immunoradiometric assay for FSH, we studied the serum bioactivity and bio- to immunoactivity (B/I) ratios of 14 men with FSH-secreting adenomas and compared these values to those of 11 age-matched normal men. In addition, three adenoma patients received TRH (400 micrograms, iv). The mean basal serum FSH level (international units per L), as measured by both bio- and immunoassays, and the FSH B/I ratios were significantly higher (P less than 0.02, by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) in the adenoma patients than in normal men (mean +/- SEM; adenoma patients: bioactivity, 68.8 +/- 10.4; immunoreactivity, 34.8 +/- 13.7; B/I ratio, 3.4 +/- 0.6; normal men: bioactivity, 5.8 +/- 1.2; immunoreactivity, 6.4 +/- 0.8; B/I ratio, 0.90 +/- 0.1). Both bio- and immunoactive FSH rose after TRH injection, resulting in maintenance of the B/I (mean +/- SEM; pre-TRH: bio-FSH, 63.7 +/- 22.4; immuno-FSH, 28.0 +/- 14.1; B/I ratio, 2.8 +/- 1.2; post-TRH: bio-FSH, 125.6 +/- 42.7; immuno-FSH, 45.8 +/- 21.8; B/I ratio, 3.5 +/- 1.6). When gonadotroph adenoma cells from three separate patients were cultured and their conditioned media (n = 3) studied, relatively large amounts of both bio- and immuno-FSH were detected. Furthermore, the major isoelectric profile of bio-FSH (pH 4.9-3.0) in the conditioned medium from two such adenomas was shown by chromatofocusing to be comparable to that of purified human pituitary FSH (pH 5.2-3.6). We conclude that gonadotroph adenomas in men secrete FSH that is biologically active, both basally and in response to TRH.\r"

The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a single midcycle dose of GnRH agonist with hCG on follicular maturation. Eighteen IVF cycles in 14 women were randomized to receive either 0.5 mg leuprolide acetate or 5000 IU hCG at midcycle. Both groups underwent identical ovarian stimulation and cycle monitoring. On the day of GnRH agonist or hCG administration, estradiol concentrations and the number of follicles 1.5 cm or larger were the same in both groups. Mean serum LH and FSH levels were elevated for 34 h after GnRH agonist administration. In contrast, mean serum hCG levels were elevated for approximately 6 days after the administration of hCG, and serum FSH levels did not change. Mean luteal phase serum estradiol concentrations were lower in the GnRH agonist group than in the hCG group (P less than 0.02). No differences were observed in mean serum progesterone or PRL during the luteal phase or in the length of the luteal phase in the two groups. The mean number of oocytes retrieved and embryo number and quality did not differ between the two groups. Three of nine GnRH agonist cycles and none of nine hCG cycles resulted in clinical pregnancy (P = 0.1). The results of this study indicate that GnRH agonist is able to simulate a midcycle surge of gonadotropins, leading to follicular maturation and pregnancy. Further work is needed to determine whether there is any clinical advantage of GnRH agonist over hCG administration with regard to pregnancy rates.\r"

We used amniotic fluid cells in the 17th week of gestation to detect VDDR-II in fetuses at risk for the defect. First, we demonstrated in cells obtained from 15 control pregnancies the presence of a specific high affinity 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor (Kd = 0.3 x 10(-11) mol/L; maximal number of binding sites, 6.1 fmol/mg protein) and 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase activity (up to 30-fold increase). Amniotic fluid cells from a woman who had already given birth to a child with VDDR-II contained receptors that bound [3H]1,25-(OH)2D3 normally and responded to 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulation with a 10-fold increase in 24-hydroxylase activity. The fetus was, therefore, judged unaffected, and a normal baby girl was born. At the age of 16 months she did not demonstrate clinical or biochemical features of VDDR-II. Amniotic fluid cells from another mother of a child with VDDR-II were unable to bind [3H]1,25-(OH)2D3, and the hormone failed to stimulate 24-hydroxylase activity. VDDR-II in this fetus was confirmed after termination of pregnancy by the total inability of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to stimulate 24-hydroxylase activity in tissue explants and cell cultures prepared from the fetus's kidney and skin. In contrast, tissues from dead control fetuses responded to stimulation by 1,25-(OH)2D3 with a 3- to 10-fold increase in 24-hydroxylase activity. Fetal kidney and skin explants and cell cultures also synthesized a [3H]1,25-(OH)2D3-like metabolite from [3H]25-OHD3 as early as the 17th week of gestation. 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10 nM) decreased the in vitro synthesis of the [3H]1,25-(OH)2D3-like metabolite in tissues from dead control fetuses, but not from the affected fetus. Thus, human fetuses at midgestation already have the regulatory mechanisms responsive to 1,25-(OH)2D3 present postnatally. The prenatal diagnosis of VDDR-II is now possible and is indicated in a high risk family.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the hypothesis of an atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) deficiency in hypertension-prone humans, we investigated plasma ANF and other variables in 116 white offspring of normotensive parents (ONorm) or essential hypertensive parents (OHyp). Ten ONorm and 10 OHyp, all men matched for age and body habitus, were studied after 4 days of low (70 mmol/day) and high (350 mmol/day) dietary sodium intake. After mild sodium restriction, plasma ANF did not differ between ONorm and OHyp (9.7 +/- 0.7 vs. 9.0 +/- 1.3 fmol/L). On high sodium intake, plasma ANF increased in ONorm, but not in OHyp (to 18.3 +/- 1.7 vs. 11.7 +/- 1.7 fmol/L; P less than 0.001). On the other hand, acute responses of plasma immunoreactive ANF (irANF) to saline loading or a norepinephrine-induced rise in blood pressure did not differ significantly between 8 ONorm and 8 OHyp. Fifty-one additional ONorm and 45 OHyp were evaluated during liberal sodium intake. Groups were further subdivided according to whether 24-h urinary sodium excretion was 91 mmol/m2 or less (modest salt intake) or more than 91 mmol/m2 (high salt intake). Twenty-four-hour urinary sodium was similar in the 26 ONorm and 21 OHyp on a modest salt intake (121 +/- 6 vs. 116 +/- 9 mmol) and in the 25 ONorm and the 24 OHyp on a high salt intake (226 +/- 10 vs. 221 +/- 9 mmol). However, compared with ONorm, plasma irANF in OHyp was slightly lower on modest sodium intake (7.7 +/- 0.7 vs. 5.3 +/- 0.7 fmol/L; P less than 0.05) and markedly reduced on high sodium intake (15.0 +/- 1.3 vs. 8.0 +/- 1.3 fmol/L; P less than 0.001). Moreover, the slope of the relationship between plasma irANF and 24-h urinary sodium was flatter in OHyp than in ONorm (z test = 2.4). We postulate a new endocrine syndrome characterized by a relative plasma ANF deficiency during high sodium intake in some hypertension-prone humans. This functional defect becomes apparent during chronic, rather than acute, stimulation of ANF release. It occurs as a familial disturbance and may potentially predispose to the development of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "We have completed a 13-yr longitudinal study of endocrine features in females originally aged 7-17 yr and report now factors related to fertility in these women, mainly serum testosterone (T) and androstenedione (A) concentrations in relation to becoming pregnant. Longitudinal regression analysis, corrected for the effect of age, showed that current serum T and A concentrations are correlated with those measured 12 yr earlier (T: r = 0.47, P less than 0.01; A: r = 0.57, P less than 0.001). Age-adjusted serum T and A concentrations before any pregnancies were higher in women who subsequently had no pregnancies than in those who had been pregnant (T: never pregnant, mean +/- SEM, 1.10 +/- 0.06 nmol/L, pregnant 0.81 +/- 0.07 nmol/L, P = 0.004; A: never pregnant 4.00 +/- 0.28 nmol/L, pregnant 2.98 +/- 0.33 nmol/L, P = 0.03). Serum androgen concentrations were not related to variables reflecting sexual behavior and the use of oral contraception. The data therefore show that adolescent serum androgen concentrations are preserved into adulthood and are reflected in fertility patterns during the third decade of life. Higher serum androgen concentrations are associated with lower fertility. Together with our previous findings, these data demonstrate that endocrine characteristics formed during puberty seem to persist at least until 30 yr of age.\r"

Eleven of the 24 patients regularly transfused in countries outside Britain were anti-HCV seropositive; only six of the 49 regularly transfused in Britain were seropositive. The incidence of anti-HBs and anti-HBc was similar to that of anti-HCV in both the British and foreign patients. The anti-HCV seropositive patients showed significantly higher plasma aspartate aminotransferase activities (AST), mean (SD) 10.2 (70.3) U/l, and serum ferritin concentrations, 4067 (2708) micrograms/l, than the anti-HCV seronegative patients (AST, 33.9 (15.6) U/l; serum ferritin 2051 (2092) U/l), respectively. Among the 36 patients who had earlier undergone liver biopsy 10 of 21 with histological features of chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis, or both, were seropositive for anti-HCV whereas only one of 15 without histological evidence of chronic viral hepatitis was seropositive for anti-HCV. It is concluded that HCV is a major cause of chronic hepatitis in patients with thalassaemia major and is associated with raised AST activity and serum ferritin concentration compared with patients seronegative for anti-HCV.\r"

The anti-HCV prevalence was 0.95% in 420 volunteer blood donors, 90% in 100 hemophiliacs, and 81% in 58 parenteral drug abusers. Anti-HCV was present in 6 (7.7%) of 78 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive and 28 (65%) of 43 HBsAg-negative patients with chronic hepatitis, 3 (10%) of 31 HBsAg-positive and 13 (43%) of 30 HBsAg-negative cirrhotics, and 7 (17%) of 42 HBsAg-positive and 15 (63%) of 24 HBsAg-negative patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An outbreak of non-A, non-B hepatitis revealed 18% of 57 patients to be positive for anti-HCV, and in 29 patients with posttransfusion hepatitis prospectively followed, 7 (24%) developed anti-HCV. Thus, HCV infection appears to play a relatively minor role in HBsAg-positive liver disease in Taiwan but is strongly associated with HBsAg-negative chronic liver disease and HCC. The infection is extremely common in hemophiliacs and parenteral drug abusers.\r"

Risk factors independently associated with HCV antibody seropositivity were history and duration of intravenous drug use and frequency of injections. Daily smoking of heroin in the previous 6 months was independently associated with the absence of HCV antibodies. Periods of fever, tiredness, and diarrhea in the preceding 6 months were associated with HCV antibodies even after correction for human immunodeficiency virus infection. The incidence rate of HCV infection appeared high and stable over the years 1986 to 1989. Thus, HCV infections are common among intravenous drug users and are mainly due to the intravenous use of drugs.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of AIDS is complex and poorly understood despite intensive research efforts. One of the most puzzling aspects of the disease is the long interval between primary infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the production of antiviral antibodies and onset of overt disease. Probably the most important factor that determines the length of these intervals is the rate at which HIV replicates within the infected host. Molecular studies have suggested that the replication of HIV can be enhanced by concurrent infection with other viruses, especially herpesviruses such as cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. Presumably the presence of those viruses would serve to accelerate the progression of HIV-mediated disease. In contrast, studies reported here indicate that coinfection of cell populations with HIV and human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) leads to a near total suppression of HIV replication. The replication of HHV-6 is unaffected or minimally enhanced by the presence of HIV. These findings suggest that HHV-6 might serve to slow the progression of disease in some HIV-infected individuals.\r"

The epidemic of 1966-1967 and the hyperendemic wave of 1972 were caused, in large part, by two closely related but distinct clones of serotype 2b isolates, ET-11 and ET-17, respectively.

Increased sensitivity to the bactericidal action of serum in the presence of cefepime was observed for several different clinical isolates. With the use of C8-deficient sera, the late components of the complement pathway were shown to be essential for bacterial killing. A significant increase in the amount of [125I]C9 based on bacterial mass was observed with bacteria incubated with cefepime compared with non-antibiotic- or amikacin-treated controls. No major change in the amount of type of lipopolysaccharide was observed when cefepime-treated and control bacteria were compared. The data show that cefepime and other cephalosporins at sublethal concentrations increase the complement-mediated bactericidal activity of serum against P. aeruginosa.\r"

Uptake of M. avium detected by counting intracellular acid-fast bacilli differed according to colonial morphology: Bacteria with round and opaque colony forms were phagocytosed more readily than those with flat colonies. Virulence as defined by intracellular growth was also partly associated with colonial morphology. Some but not all bacilli with flat colony forms multiplied in human monocytes; strains of the round opaque colonial form did not. The effects of recombinant human interferon-gamma on M. avium infection also were examined. Pretreatment of monocytes suppressed phagocytosis. After infection, coculturing usually augmented mycobacterial growth inhibition by human monocytes, but these effects were variable from strain to strain. Overall, interferon-gamma produced a small but statistically significant inhibition of intracellular growth in three of four strains tested.\r"

We investigated whether asbestos, either alone or in conjunction with serum, injured cultured HPEC as assessed in a standard chromium 51 release assay. Amosite asbestos in serum-free media induced modest HPEC injury (9.4% +/- 3.3% Cr release), which was significantly enhanced (2.7-fold) in the presence of serum (25.5% +/- 4% Cr release). HPEC cytotoxicity was both asbestos and serum dose-dependent. Additionally, we demonstrated that, compared with HPEC injury induced by asbestos plus serum, (1) heat-decomplemented serum or serum fractions of a wide range of molecular weights were equipotent to fresh serum, (2) catalase, superoxide dismutase, or dimethylthiourea was not protective, (3) 3-aminobenzamide, which prevents oxidant-induced adenosine triphosphate depletion by inhibiting poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase, afforded significant protection (32% decrease in HPEC injury), and (4) deferoxamine-treated asbestos was significantly less toxic to HPEC compared with untreated asbestos, causing a 57% decrease in HPEC cytotoxicity. Electron microscopic studies revealed that, compared with buffer, serum increased the amount of amosite asbestos along the surface and inside HPEC. Thus, amosite asbestos is cytotoxic to cultured HPEC and serum promotes this injurious effect by augmenting the interaction of asbestos with HPEC. These data suggest that this effect may occur by increasing intracellular oxidant stress mediated in part by the iron in asbestos.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy and safety of a new, selective inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, pravastatin, and the bile acid-binding resin, cholestyramine, were compared in a randomized, double-blind study of 120 patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia. After a run-in period of 8-10 weeks with assessment of dietary habits, the patients were treated with pravastatin + placebo, placebo + cholestyramine, or placebo alone. Active pravastatin therapy was initiated with 10 mg b.i.d. for 6 weeks, and was increased to 20 mg b.i.d. for the following 6 weeks. Cholestyramine was given at 24 g d-1, or the highest tolerable dose. After 6 weeks of therapy, serum total and LDL cholesterol levels were reduced by 17% and 21%, respectively, on pravastatin treatment, whereas the corresponding reductions with cholestyramine treatment were 24% and 30%, respectively. With an increased dose of pravastatin, serum and LDL cholesterol concentrations were reduced by 23% and 28%, respectively, after 12 weeks; the effect of cholestyramine was unchanged. HDL cholesterol levels increased in response to pravastatin, by 7% and 9% after 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. Concomitant changes in the concentrations of apolipoproteins B and AI were observed. Three patients discontinued the study because of side-effects: two subjects were treated with pravastatin and one was given placebo. The prevalence of side-effects (including laboratory abnormalities) was 35% for pravastatin, 30% for placebo, and 53% (significantly higher) for cholestyramine. We conclude that pravastatin, in a 40 mg daily dose, is as effective as cholestyramine in lowering LDL cholesterol in familial hypercholesterolaemia. Since the frequency of side-effects is higher with cholestyramine, pravastatin offers a promising alternative for the therapy of this genetic disease.\r"

All three factors were grossly elevated in both the study group and the contrast group. In the autoimmune patient group, the three haemostatic variables were significantly correlated with orosomucoid levels, demonstrating the acute-phase nature of the increased levels of vWF, tPA and PAI. These findings support the view that haemostatic factors of the vessel wall are implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide spectrum of diseases.\r"

Pravastatin decreased serum total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) after 8 weeks of treatment by 28% and 33%, respectively, while high density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 8% and triglycerides decreased by 14%. In 30 patients LDL cholesterol had not decreased below 5.0 mmol l-1 after 8 weeks of treatment, and in these patients resins were added to pravastatin, resulting in an additional decrease in total and LDL cholesterol of 8% and 12%, respectively. A control group of 22 FH patients was treated with placebo for 10 weeks, after which time resins were added, and they induced a decrease in total and LDL-cholesterol of 17% and 22%, respectively. Our results over a 24-week treatment period indicate that 40 mg pravastatin is more effective than 3 packets of resins in lowering LDL cholesterol, whereas the combination is most effective of all and can be used safely.\r"

Seventeen (81%) of the stroke patients showed a paradoxical rise in growth hormone in response to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH). In a multiple regression model, disorientation was associated with a low thyrotropin response to TRH (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04; 20 and 60 min after TRH, respectively). Disorientation was also positively correlated with the prolactin response to TRH (P = 0.045 after 60 min). Growth hormone levels were predicted by extensive motor impairment (P = 0.02). In conclusion, changes in pituitary and thyroid hormones were commonly observed after stroke and were closely associated with cognitive and/or motor impairment.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibody UM-A9 identifies an antigen found on the basal surface of epithelial cells and expressed on all of the squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) that we have tested. In a previous study, we showed that cell lines from metastatic or recurrent SCC exhibit stronger expression of the A9 cell membrane antigen than cell lines from the primary tumor of the same donors, suggesting that this marker is associated with tumor progression. Loss of expression in tumor tissue of normal A, B, and H (ABH) blood group antigens has also been linked to clinical behavior in some epithelial cancers. To determine the prognostic significance of these antigen markers, we prospectively evaluated tissue specimens for expression of these markers in a group of 82 consecutive, previously untreated patients with SCC of the head and neck. Three patterns corresponding to strong (pattern 1), intermediate (pattern 2), or weak (pattern 3) A9 antigen expression were observed. Fifty-eight percent of the patients whose tumors had pattern 1 A9 antigen expression and 78% of the patients with loss of blood group antigen had early relapse, compared with only 34% of those with A9 antigen pattern 2 or 3 (P = .042) and 37% of those whose tumors expressed the mature ABH blood group antigen (P = .012). The combination of A9 pattern and ABH blood group antigen expression in tumor tissue was the variable most strongly associated with duration of disease-free survival, even after adjustment for the traditional prognostic factors of tumor site, stage, and TNM classification. Loss of blood group was the most significant single variable associated with early recurrence, but among patients whose tumors retained ABH blood group antigen expression, the A9 pattern distinguished good and poor prognostic groups. To our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate that differences in blood group antigen expression are significantly correlated with disease-free survival in SCC of the head and neck. We have initiated a study (a) to determine the relationship of the A9 antigen and the blood group antigens with clinical response of the tumors and (b) to determine whether these markers should be used as prognostic indicators.\r"

  ".W": "Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is associated with intestinal and pancreatic atrophy and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Recent investigations have demonstrated that the addition of glutamine to intravenous feedings attenuates TPN-associated intestinal atrophy. However, the effect of glutamine-supplemented intravenous feedings on the pancreas of intact animals is unknown. This study compared the effects of an intravenous infusion of a 2% glutamine-enriched diet (GLN) with an isonitrogenous, isocaloric diet without glutamine (CONT) on the composition and structure of the exocrine pancreas in laboratory rats with and without a 60% small bowel resection. In nonresected, TPN-fed animals, pancreatic weight was significantly increased in the GLN group when compared to CONT (645 +/- 33 g vs 554 +/- 20 g, p less than 0.05). Nonresected GLN animals also had increased pancreatic DNA (3.82 +/- 0.19 mg vs 2.91 +/- 0.49 mg, p less than 0.005) and protein contents (93.0 +/- 5.9 mg vs 76.6 +/- 7.0 mg, p = 0.08) compared to control. Similar significant increases in pancreatic weight, DNA, and protein were observed in intestinally resected animals fed the glutamine diet. When data from CONT and GLN animals were pooled and analyzed together, glutamine significantly increased total pancreatic trypsinogen and lipase contents (p less than 0.05). The increase in trypsinogen in resected GLN animals was significantly greater than in CONT animals (283 +/- 22 vs 139 +/- 23, p less than 0.005). Biochemical and morphometric observations demonstrated that the trophic effects of glutamine on the exocrine pancreas were manifest by acinar hyperplasia and not hypertrophy. Glutamine appears to be an important nutrient for pancreatic exocrine tissue during TPN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Documentation included SA, medications, stool frequency, gastric residuals (GR), and daily caloric intake. ENS intolerance was defined as greater than 3 stools/day for greater than 48 hr or GR greater than twice the hourly infusion rate for greater than 48 hr. Patients were categorized into two groups: those with SA greater than or equal to 2.5 g/dl (group I) and those with SA less than 2.5 g/dl (group II). Of 88 patients studied, 48 (86%) in group I and 28 (88%) in group II tolerated the ENS. Eight (14%) in group I and 4 (12%) in group II experienced ENS intolerance. There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of ENS intolerance between these two groups (p less than 0.05). Also, 97% of all those with a SA less than 2.5 g/dl were fed 80% or more of their estimated caloric requirements. We concluded that ENS tolerance was not affected by the SA level and patients with hypoalbuminemia (SA less than 2.5 g/dl) could be fed enterally.\r"

In particular, apolipoproteins C-II and C-III (apo C-II and apo C-III) are rapidly transferred from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to exo TG, and return to HDL after the hydrolysis of exo TG. The present study was undertaken to examine whether the movement of apo C-II and apo C-III between HDL and exo TG is influenced by a prior injection of fat emulsion. Two experiments were undertaken. In experiment 1, six male volunteers received three bolus injections of a fat emulsion at a dose of 0.1 g of TG/kg with intervals of 90 min between injections. In experiment 2, the plasma concentrations of triglycerides were maintained at approximately 500 mg/dl for 160 min by the continuous infusion of exo TG. Levels of apo C-II and apo C-III, and the elimination rate of exo TG were followed in each test. In experiment 1, the movement of apolipoproteins between exo TG and HDL was unchanged between the first, second, and third bolus. The elimination rate of exo TG after the third bolus was higher than that after the first bolus. In experiment 2, after the administration of exo TG, the levels of C apolipoproteins in the fraction of HDL began to decrease, and those in the fraction of very-low-density lipoprotein that contained exo TG began to increase. When the concentrations of triglycerides in plasma reached a plateau, the distribution of C apolipoproteins in the lipoprotein fraction also stabilized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We randomly assigned 28 hypoalbuminemic cirrhotic patients to receive, immediately after liver transplantation, one of three regimens: group 1, no nutritional support (n = 10); group 2, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (35 kcal/kg/day) with standard amino acids (1.5 g/kg/day) (n = 8); or group 3, isocaloric isonitrogenous TPN with added branched-chain amino acids (n = 10). Therapy was continued for 7 days posttransplant. Jaundice resolution was unaffected by nutritional support. Nitrogen balance favored both TPN groups. Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) aromatic amino acid ratios were highest in group 3. Coma scores and serum ammonia levels were similar in all groups. Both TPN groups achieved respirator independence earlier; this difference was not statistically significant. Group 1 patients stayed longest in ICU; the difference was statistically significant. TPN with either standard or BCAA- enriched amino acids is tolerated well immediately after successful liver transplant. Positive nitrogen balance is achieved; large protein loads do not worsen encephalopathy. Nutritional support may improve respiratory muscle function, allowing earlier weaning from ventilatory support. A shortened length of ICU stay justifies the expense of TPN.\r"

Amino acid solutions containing BCAA 25%, 30%, 40%, 45% and 50% were prepared and were administered iv for three days with other essential amino acid-containing nitrogen in the same volume into rats with peritonitis which had been developed by ligature and puncture at the cecum, and the results were compared. After observing for three days, the influence over nitrogen balance, improvement of 3-methyl-histidine/creatinine in urine, weight loss in muscles, and aminogram in serum and muscles indicated that the hyperalimentation under stress is utilized most effectively when amino acid contains 45% of branched-chain amino acid.\r"

All subjects but one accepted the treatment which was stopped as soon as an adequate spontaneous food intake was resumed. Enteral nutrition caused a significant increase of mid-arm muscle circumference and of tricipital skinfold. Body weight gain was remarkable, averaging a rate of 8.22 kg/month. This value was not different from the levels attained by anorectic subjects put on total parenteral nutrition. Furthermore, a significant rise of some biochemical indexes, namely prealbumin and total iron binding capacity, was achieved. The most impressive drawbacks of enteral nutrition were occasional hypophosphatemia and moderate rise of serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferases. Both of these abnormalities were transient and apparently not associated with clinical disturbances.\r"

  ".W": "The use of uncuffed endotracheal tubes (ETT) in pediatric patients raises concern over the accuracy of indirect calorimetry measurement in the presence of a gas leak around an ETT. We examined the effects of ETT gas leak on respiratory gas measurements in a dog model. Mongrel dogs (n = 12) were sedated, paralyzed, intubated, and placed on mechanical ventilation. Leak was achieved by adjusting cuff volume. Oxygen consumption (VO2), CO2 production (VCO2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and resting energy expenditure (REE) were measured at each leak pressure (Pleak). Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), Pleak, inspiratory and expiratory tidal volume (VTinsp, VTexp), VE, end tidal CO2 (ETCO2), and blood gases were recorded at each leak pressure. VO2, VCO, and REE decreased significantly with increasing gas leak. There was a linear relationship between VO2, VCO2, and REE with both TVratio (VTexp/VTinsp) and Pdiff (PIP-Pleak). Multiple regression equations based on TVratio and Pdiff were obtained which allowed correction of the measurement error in VO2, VCO2, and REE, with correlation coefficients (R2) of 0.71, 0.75, and 0.73, respectively. ETT gas leak affects measurements of VO2, VCO2, and REE, but not RER. Measurements made with TVratio greater than 0.80 required no correction. Measurements made with TVratio greater than 0.45 could be corrected to actual values in our model with regression equations based on TVratio and Pdiff. We conclude that indirect calorimetry measurements can be useful in the presence of tracheal gas leak around an ETT.\r"

In addition to fulfilling its role as an organ of digestion and absorption, the gut must maintain immunologic function in order to protect the host from invading pathogens. Central to the function of the intestinal immune system is the expression of secretory IgA, the most abundant immunoglobulin in external secretions. The synthesis and expression of IgA in secretions appear to be sensitive to dietary alteration and may be impaired after surgical stress. Data are presented suggesting that maintenance of gut mass and barrier function to bacteria via dietary manipulation may be essential to ensure host survival during critical illness.\r"

  ".U": "90383948\r", 
  ".W": "Of the total pool of muscle free intracellular amino acids, glutamine represents about 60%. During catabolic stress, a marked reduction (50%) of this pool occurs; the depletion is not reversible by therapeutic efforts or conventional nutritional means. If maintenance of the intracellular glutamine pool promotes conservation of muscle protein, there is a theoretical case for use of glutamine supplements in the parenteral nutrition of patients with injury and infection. Glutamine is too unstable and poorly soluble for addition to existing preparations in its native form, but this drawback can be overcome by the use of synthetic stable and highly soluble glutamine-containing dipeptides. In vivo studies in humans and animals provide firm evidence that a synthetic glutamine-containing dipeptide, L-alanyl-L-glutamine (Ala-Gln), is readily hydrolyzed following its intravenous administration. The results also indicate a safe and efficient use of Ala-Gln as a source of free glutamine in parenteral nutrition. In clinical studies, nitrogen balance was more positive in catabolic patients receiving a peptide-supplemented solution than in control patients given isonitrogenous, isoenergetic total parenteral nutrition. Muscle glutamine concentrations were markedly decreased in the control groups. The intracellular concentrations were not influenced following severe injury, but were maintained in postoperative trauma. It is inferred that the increased intestinal requirement and cellular demand for metabolic fuel during catabolic stress is matched by an enhanced demand on muscle glutamine, resulting in intracellular glutamine depletion. Thus, the delivery of adequate amounts of glutamine is essential to maintain the integrity of intestinal mucosa and rapidly proliferating cells, to preserve the muscle glutamine pool, and to improve overall nitrogen economy during conditions of stress.\r"

  ".W": "Skeletal muscle protein catabolism following trauma has until recently not been possible to counteract by intravenous nutritional means. The obligatory loss of nitrogen with concomitant reduction of skeletal muscle protein synthesis is also accompanied by a decrease of muscle free glutamine, the extent of which is proportional to the muscle protein catabolism. Serving as a human model of surgical trauma, patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy were given total parenteral nutrition including additions of either glutamine or its analogs (ornithine-alpha-ketoglutarate, alpha-ketoglutarate, or alanylglutamine) during 3 postoperative days. The polyribosome concentration and the intracellular glutamine concentration in skeletal muscle, as well as nitrogen balance, showed a less pronounced skeletal muscle catabolism in these groups than when conventional total parenteral nutrition was given. It is concluded that a support of either glutamine or its carbon skeleton, alpha-ketoglutarate, counteracts the postoperative fall of muscle free glutamine and of muscle protein synthesis. Furthermore, statistical correlations could be shown between the changes of muscle glutamine and muscle protein synthesis and the postoperative nitrogen losses.\r"

Initial studies in normal individuals evaluated the short-term response to oral loads of glutamine at doses of 0, 0.1, and 0.3 g/kg. A dose-related increase in blood glutamine occurred after oral loading and elevation of amino acids known to be end products of glutamine metabolism occurred (including alanine, citrulline, and arginine). No evidence of clinical toxicity or generation of toxic metabolites (ammonia and glutamate) was observed. Glutamine was infused intravenously in normal subjects over 4 hr at doses of 0.0125 and 0.025 g/kg/hr. In addition, glutamine was evaluated as a component of parenteral nutrition solutions (0.285 and 0.570 g/kg/day) administered for 5 days to normal subjects. Intravenous administration of glutamine was well tolerated without untoward clinical or biochemical effects. Subsequent studies in patients receiving glutamine-enriched parenteral nutrition for several weeks confirmed the clinical safety of this approach in a catabolic patient population. In addition, nitrogen retention appeared to be enhanced when glutamine was administered at a dose of 0.570 g/kg/day in a balanced nutritional solution providing adequate calories (145% of basal) and protein (1.5 g/kg/day). Nitrogen balance in patients receiving lower doses of glutamine (0.285 g/kg/day) was similar to that in patients receiving standard formulations. Further controlled clinical trials of the metabolic efficacy, tolerance, and dose response of glutamine in other patient groups are necessary to determine the appropriate use of glutamine enrichment of nutrient solutions.\r"

  ".W": "Glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid in plasma and tissue pools and an important intermediate in a number of metabolic pathways. Glutamine levels decline markedly in the course of many different catabolic disease states and it has recently been suggested that glutamine may be a conditionally essential dietary nutrient rather than a nonessential amino acid. Changes in tissue glutamine concentrations have been shown to correlate with net protein turnover, and there is evidence that glutamine may both stimulate protein synthesis and inhibit protein degradation. In experimental animals, we have shown that the fall in glutamine concentrations in plasma and tissue pools that occurs in the postoperative state can be prevented or reversed by providing large quantities of exogenous glutamine. In gastrointestinal tissues, the provision of glutamine-free total parenteral nutrition solutions is associated with atrophy of mucosal cells and pancreatic exocrine cells. Glutamine-supplemented parenteral formulas result in diminished atrophy of intestinal mucosal and pancreatic exocrine cells; both intravenous and enteral glutamine promote gastrointestinal tissue regeneration following toxic injury. In animals undergoing partial small intestine resection, glutamine feeding leads to increased adaptive hyperplasia in remaining intestinal segments and results in earlier postoperative weight gain. All of these trophic, anabolic effects of glutamine require the administration of quantities that exceed the glutamine content of normal dietary protein. These findings in experimental animals support the hypothesis that glutamine is a conditionally essential nutrient and suggest a potentially important role for glutamine-supplemented nutrition in catabolic disease states.\r"

Secondly, as adenosine (AD) has been implicated as a metabolic mediator of TGF, we also hypothesized that ANF would antagonize the renal actions of AD. To test this hypothesis, RBF and GFR were assessed in response to hypertonic saline (HS, 16%, i.r.) or adenosine (AD, 0.1 mumol/min, i.r.) in the presence and absence of exogenous ANF (100 ng/kg/min, i.r.). ANF attenuated HS-mediated reductions in GFR (HS, -39.6 +/- 9.8 ml/min vs. HS + ANF, -14.3 +/- 4.5 ml/min, P less than 0.05) and in RBF (HS, -143 +/- 35 ml/min vs. HS + ANF, -5 +/- 22 ml/min, P less than 0.05). GFR was reduced by AD (-9.2 +/- 3.0 ml/min, P less than 0.05), but maintained by AD + ANF (-0.4 +/- 2.0 ml/min, NS). A transient adenosine-mediated vasoconstriction was attenuated by ANF (AD, -54.5 +/- 3.6 ml/min vs. AD + ANF, -3.7 +/- 3.1 ml/min, P less than 0.005). We conclude that ANF at pharmacologic concentrations attenuates at the whole kidney level hypertonic saline and adenosine-mediated reductions in RBF and GFR.\r"

Thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and other prostaglandins (PG) act through specific receptors and mechanisms of intracellular signal transduction in human mesangial cells. We studied the actions of U-46619, a TxA2 mimetic which stimulates mesangial phospholipase C, and of the PGI2 analogue, Iloprost, a potent activator of adenylate cyclase, on proliferation of cultured human mesangial cells. When applied alone to quiescent cells, U-46619 had only weak mitogenic activity, as assessed by [3H]thymidine [( 3H]-TdR) incorporation and cell counts. On the other hand, addition of U-46619 10 minutes prior to stimulation of the cells with 1 to 17% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 24 hours, potently and dose-dependently inhibited FBS-stimulated [3H]-TdR incorporation. Similarly, U-46619 inhibited the effects of 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor or basic fibroblast growth factor on [3H]-TdR incorporation, by 55, 79 and 88%, respectively. The effects of U-46619 were not mimicked by another stimulus of phospholipase C, angiotensin II. Iloprost also inhibited FBS-activated proliferation. Neither eicosanoid inhibited the rise of cytosolic Ca2+ induced by FBS or PDGF. The actions of TxA2 and Iloprost in cultured cells point to multiple functional interactions between eicosanoids and growth factors in the control of mesangial cell proliferation.\r"

In the present study a 150 K protein was isolated from the guanidine extract of bovine glomerular basement membrane utilizing ion exchange and gel filtration chromatographic procedures. Amino acid analysis and size of the isolated protein revealed similarity to that of entactin/nidogen. The identity of this protein as entactin/nidogen was further suggested by its precipitation with two different antibodies in a radioimmunoassay and by its reaction with four different antibodies in a sandwich ELISA. Inhibition of the antibodies to 150 K by bovine entactin, which was isolated separately and sequenced for amino acids, confirmed the identity of the 150 K protein as entactin/nidogen. Furthermore, it was shown that about one third of those patients who show antibodies to the crude guanidine extract have circulating antibodies directed against entactin. This was further confirmed by the competitive inhibition of antibodies to the crude guanidine extract in one of the positive serum by entactin in an ELISA inhibition and by immunoblotting experiments. These observations propose entactin as a possible non-Goodpasture glomerular basement membrane antigen that could be involved in the pathogenesis of certain forms of autoimmune glomerulonephritis (non-Goodpasture anti-GBM glomerulonephritis) in man. Most of these patients have a granular pattern of the immunoglobulin deposition along the glomerular basement membrane. This suggests the possibility that anti-GBM glomerulonephritis in human beings can have non-linear immunoglobulin deposits along the GBM.\r"

Selective immune-mediated mesangial cell injury was induced by i.v. administration of a rabbit anti-rat thymocyte antiserum (ATS). Intravenous ATS leads to immune deposits in the mesangium followed by mesangiolysis and the infiltration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes and monocytes. Glomerular TxB2 formation two hours (292 +/- 27 pg/mg/min) and 48 hours (396 +/- 69 pg/mg/min) following antibody was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher compared to animals receiving non-antibody rabbit IgG (TxB2: 2 hr 143 +/- 13; 48 hr 171 +/- 32 pg/mg/min). Treatment with cobra venom factor (CVF) and the reduction of glomerular monocyte infiltration inhibited the increase of glomerular TxB2 formation significantly. Depletion of granulocytes with a rabbit anti-rat granulocyte serum had no effect on glomerular prostanoid formation following ATS. Glomerular PGE2 and 6-keto PGF1 alpha production was not altered following ATS. Inulin clearance in rats with immune-mediated mesangial cell injury was significantly (P less than 0.001) lower at two hours (456 +/- 24 microliters/min/100 g body wt) and 48 hours (433 +/- 54 microliters/min/100 g body wt) compared to their corresponding control animals which were treated with non-antibody IgG (2 hr: 914 +/- 51; 48 hr: 694 +/- 79 microliters/min/100 g body wt).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We determined the prevalence of antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) in 90 patients and 37 staff members of two hemodialysis units utilizing a recently developed anti-HCV recombinant based assay. Eleven patients (12%) were anti-HCV(+). Of these, eight (73%) had antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) indicating prior hepatitis B infection; one patient was hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)(+). All staff members were anti-HCV(-), although seven (19%) of them were anti-HBc(+). Alanine aminotransferase elevations were present at the time of the study in four anti-HCV(-) patients and in only one anti-HCV(+) patient. All anti-HCV(+) (mean 59 +/- 74; range 3 to 269 units) and 85% of anti-HCV(-) patients (mean 16 +/- 27; range 0 to 204 units) had received multiple blood transfusions (P = 0.348). Among 50 patients tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 43% of anti-HCV(+) as compared to only 7% anti-HCV(-) were positive (P = 0.003). There was a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) in eight (72%) of the anti-HCV(+) patients and in only seven (9%) of the anti-HCV(-) group (P = 0.00001). The results of this serologic survey suggests that anti-HCV positivity is prevalent, although much less than anti-HBc, among our dialysis patients, whereas it was not detected among staff members. The prevalence rate of anti-HCV was statistically significantly higher among anti-HIV(+) and IVDA patients but not in multi-transfused patients.\r"

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were 4-128 mg/l, and concentrations 2-4 times the MIC were fungicidal. Blood culture isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis had MIC values of 64-256 mg/l. Antibacterial activity was strongly influenced by the nature of the culture medium. In view of the biological activity of L1, the name calprotectin is proposed to describe this antimicrobial protein with calcium binding properties.\r"

In secretors, daily intestinal output exceeded oral intake (mean 2.3 kg wet weight, and 233 mmol sodium). Long-term parenteral fluid and electrolyte replacements were needed only in those with a secretory response. Jejunal length inversely correlated with net intestinal output of fluid, sodium, potassium, and with percentage energy absorption. A secretory response was observed if jejunal length was less than 100 cm and was reduced by gastric antisecretory drugs and octreotide.\r"

Treatment with oxygen significantly improved the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), relieved symptoms of AMS, and reduced cerebral blood flow as estimated by transcranial doppler ultrasound examination of the median cerebral artery. The only significant effect of carbon dioxide was increased ventilation resulting in a slight rise in PaO2. Thus, in contrast to previous uncontrolled trials, this study does not support the usefulness of carbon dioxide treatment in AMS.\r"
