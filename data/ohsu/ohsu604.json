  ".W": "In a prospective study of 124 infants enrolled as newborns, we assessed the relation between initial lung function and the subsequent incidence of lower respiratory tract illness during the first year of life. The risk of having a wheezing illness was 3.7 times higher (95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 15.5; P = 0.06) among infants whose values for total respiratory conductance (the reciprocal of the resistance to air flow of the entire respiratory system) were in the lowest third, as compared with infants with values in the upper two thirds of the range of values for the group. Boys with initial values in the lowest third for an indirect index of airway conductance had a 10-fold increase (95 percent confidence interval, 2.2 to 44.2; P = 0.001) in the risk of having a wheezing illness. A 16-fold increase (95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 147.1; P = 0.002) in the risk of having a wheezing illness was found among girls whose initial values for lung volume at the end of tidal expiration were in the lowest third. We conclude that diminished lung function is a predisposing factor for the development of a first wheezing illness in infants.\r"

As compared with controls (n = 42), dieters (n = 42) had significant loss of total body weight (-7.8 +/- 0.9 kg [mean +/- SE]), fat weight (-5.6 +/- 0.8 kg), and lean (non-fat) weight (-2.1 +/- 0.5 kg) (P less than 0.001 for each variable), and exercisers (n = 47) had significant loss of total body weight (-4.6 +/- 0.8 kg) and fat weight (-3.8 +/- 0.7 kg) (P less than 0.001 for both variables) but not lean weight (-0.7 +/- 0.4 kg). Fat-weight loss did not differ significantly between dieters and exercisers. All subjects were discouraged from altering their diet composition; however, dieters and exercisers had slight reductions in the percentage of kilojoules derived from fat. As compared with the control group, both weight-loss groups had significant increases (P less than 0.01) in plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (diet vs. exercise, 0.13 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.12 +/- 0.03 mmol per liter), HDL2 cholesterol (0.07 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.07 +/- 0.02 mmol per liter), and HDL3 cholesterol (0.07 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.02 mmol per liter) and significant decreases (P less than 0.05) in triglyceride levels (diet vs. exercise, -0.35 +/- 0.14 vs. -0.24 +/- 0.12 mmol per liter). Levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not significantly changed, relative to values in controls. None of these changes were significantly different between dieters and exercisers. Thus, we conclude that fat loss through dieting or exercising produces comparable and favorable changes in plasma lipoprotein concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Normal hearing in mammals depends on an active mechanical filter, within the cochlea, which separates different sound frequencies before neural encoding. Experiments on the intact cochlea indicate that the critical cellular components underlying the process are probably the outer hair cells which are strategically placed to influence movement of the basilar membrane. This idea is attractive because isolated cells can generate axial forces at acoustic frequencies when electrically stimulated. The mechanical properties of cells are largely determined by structures closely associated with the plasma membrane. We show here, using light and electron microscopy, that beneath this membrane lies a lattice of crosslinked circumferential filaments which are pitched at a mean angle of 15 degrees to the transverse axis of the cell. The lattice is sufficient to retain the shape of the cell following demembranation and mechanical deformation. The structure of the lattice allows it to be described as a coiled helical spring but with longitudinal stiffness primarily determined by the crosslinks. Direct measurements of longitudinal stiffness reported here indicate that the lattice contributes 5-10% of the stiffness. We propose that the 'circumferential lattice' ensures that outer hair cells can act as directed force generators within the organ of Corti, a prerequisite in current descriptions of cochlear micromechanics.\r"

Previous work with chimaeras between the Torpedo californica and bovine AChR delta-subunits has shown that the region comprising the hydrophobic segment M2 and its vicinity contains an important determinant of the rate of ion transport through the AChR channel. It has also been suggested that this region is responsible for the reduction in channel conductance caused by divalent cations and that segment M2 contributes to the binding site of noncompetitive antagonists. To identify those amino acid residues that interact with permeating ions, we have introduced various point mutations into the Torpedo AChR subunit cDNAs to alter the net charge of the charged or glutamine residues around the proposed transmembrane segments. The single-channel conductance properties of these AChR mutants expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes indicate that three clusters of negatively charged and glutamine residues neighbouring segment M2 of the alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-subunits, probably forming three anionic rings, are major determinants of the rate of ion transport.\r"

The evidence for this physiological role for PDI is circumstantial and relates to the cell and tissue distribution of the enzyme, its developmental behaviour and its catalytic properties in vitro. A clear requirement for PDI in the correct folding or assembly of disulphide-bonded proteins during biosynthesis has not been demonstrated. We have prepared dog pancreas microsomes which are deficient in soluble lumenal proteins, including PDI, but which are still able to translocate and process proteins synthesized in vitro. Using the formation of intramolecular disulphide bonds during the in vitro synthesis of gamma-gliadin, a wheat storage protein, as a model, we have demonstrated that these microsomes are defective in co-translational formation of disulphide bonds. Reconstitution of these microsomes with purified PDI reverses this defect.\r"

Here we show how the use of mutant proteins allows the determination of the contributions of individual charges to the free energy of ion binding to proteins. We have investigated the importance of three negatively charged side chains in the binding of Ca2+ to bovine calbindin D9K (ref.2): these are clustered around the calcium sites but are not directly involved as ligands. Each of these charges is found to contribute approximately 7 kJ mol-1 to the free energy of binding of two Ca2+ ions and to affect the cooperativity of Ca2+ binding. The influence of surface charges on ion binding to proteins may be more common than generally supposed and could have important consequences for protein function.\r"

  ".W": "The conflict between the Mendelian theory of particulate inheritance and the observation of continuous variation for most traits in nature was resolved in the early 1900s by the concept that quantitative traits can result from segregation of multiple genes, modified by environmental effects. Although pioneering experiments showed that linkage could occasionally be detected to such quantitative trait loci (QTLs), accurate and systematic mapping of QTLs has not been possible because the inheritance of an entire genome could not be studied with genetic markers. The use of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) has made such investigations possible, at least in principle. Here, we report the first use of a complete RFLP linkage map to resolve quantitative traits into discrete Mendelian factors, in an interspecific back-cross of tomato. Applying new analytical methods, we mapped at least six QTLs controlling fruit mass, four QTLs for the concentration of soluble solids and five QTLs for fruit pH. This approach is broadly applicable to the genetic dissection of quantitative inheritance of physiological, morphological and behavioural traits in any higher plant or animal.\r"

  ".U": "89014742\r", 
  ".W": "Significant future developments in the effective treatment of inflammatory diseases may arise from non-toxic dual inhibitors of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways in the arachidonate cascade. Inhibition of phospholipase A2(PLA2)(EC3.1.1.4), may provide such a dual action and recent research has concentrated on the role of PLA2-inhibitory proteins as possible anti-inflammatory agents. Blastokinin or uteroglobin is a steroid-induced rabbit secretory protein with PLA2-inhibitory activity. Its biochemical and biological properties have been extensively studied and its crystallographic structure has been resolved at 1.34 A (refs 15, 16). Lipocortins are a family of related proteins, which, it has been suggested, mediate the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids (for a review, see ref. 23). Some proteins of this group have been purified and the complementary DNA sequences of two human lipocortins are known. Lipocortins inhibit PLA2 in vitro, although their mechanism of action is still unclear. Recombinant lipocortin I inhibits eicosanoid synthesis in isolated perfused lungs from the guinea pig. Here, we report that synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to a region of high amino-acid sequence similarity between uteroglobin and lipocortin I have potent PLA2 inhibitory activity in vitro and striking anti-inflammatory effects in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "89014744\r", 
  ".W": "Retinoic acid may be the natural morphogen used to generate digit pattern in the chick limb bud. It has been proposed that retinoic acid acts by binding to a cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP) and then entering the nucleus to alter the pattern of gene activity. High-affinity receptors that bind both retinoic acid and DNA and are analogous to the steroid receptors have been identified. But the concentration of endogenous retinoic acid in the limb and the binding coefficient of the nuclear receptors indicate that they are saturated throughout the limb. Here we investigate the CRABP distribution in the developing chick limb bud. We find CRABP in the area of intense morphogenetic activity at the tip, with a differential distribution across the anteroposterior axis, the high point being at the anterior margin. Retinoic acid also forms a concentration gradient across the limb bud, but is highest on the posterior side. We propose that CRABP could be reducing the effective concentration of retinoic acid reaching the nucleus to a level appropriate for the differential regulation of gene transcription, providing a spatially modulated morphogenetic gradient of information for digit formation.\r"

Because the total calcium content of dystrophic fibres is significantly raised, we have compared the intracellular free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) in skeletal muscle in normal and mdx mice. We find that [Ca2+]i is markedly elevated in mdx muscle fibres compared with normal fibres, both at rest and during stimulation. By measuring protein degradation rates and manipulating [Ca2+]i, we have been able to demonstrate directly that the elevation of [Ca2+]i in mdx fibres results in an enhanced net degradation of muscle proteins.\r"

  ".U": "89014747\r", 
  ".W": "The alpha-helix in proteins has a dipole moment resulting from the alignment of dipoles of the peptide bond which can perturb the pKas of ionizing groups. One of the two histidine residues (His18) in barnase, the small ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, is located at the negatively charged end (C-terminal) of an alpha-helix. From NMR titrations of wild-type and engineered mutants we find that the pKa of His18 is 7.9 in wild-type enzyme, 1.6 units above the value in the urea-denatured enzyme and in model peptides. This implies that there is a favourable interaction between the protonated form of His18 and the alpha-helix that should stabilize the native structure at neutral pH by 2.1 kcal mol-1. Denaturation at various values of pH of wild-type and muant enzymes engineered at position 18 shows that this is so. The increase in stability of the enzyme as the pH changes from 8.5 to 6.3 is attributable to this interaction, and the pH-stability curve fits pKa values for His18 in native and urea-denatured enzymes that are consistent with the NMR data.\r"

Some data bearing on the answer to this important question were obtained in a prospective, multicenter trial of 184 poor grade patients in a study of the calcium antagonist nimodipine. Entry was within 3 days of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The admission work-up included angiography of the anterior and posterior circulations and computed tomographic (CT) scans. The angiograms were repeated as close to Day 8 post-SAH as possible, and the CT scans were repeated at 3 months at the time of follow-up neurological assessment. Radiological assessment was performed independently of knowledge of drug treatment or patient outcome. A discriminant function analysis indicated that the relative importance of factors prognostic for outcome was, in order of importance: whether the patient was treated surgically, neurological grade on admission, age, initial systolic blood pressure, and aneurysm size. The discriminant function analysis correctly classified 80% of our cases. A constellation of poor prognostic features will aid the neurosurgeon in treating a patient conservatively and appropriately advising relatives. The ultimate decision on how to treat a given patient continues to depend partly on clinical judgement, which remains intuitive and subject to influences not studied here.\r"

The clinical findings of sciatic neuropathy, external rotation of the ipsilateral foot in the position of comfort, and a therapeutic response to local anesthetic injection into the pyriformis muscle are diagnostic of the syndrome. Nerve conduction studies should be performed to aid in the differentiation between a common peroneal and sciatic neuropathy. The syndrome may occur because of extreme flexion of the hips and prolonged pressure while in the sitting position, leading to pyriformis muscle trauma, resultant spasm, and sciatic compression.

Only rats with brain tumors showed decreased splenic NK cell activity. The spleens of these rats were morphologically small and atrophic. Expansive brain tumors were compressing the basal ganglia, thalamus, and hypothalamus after 2 weeks, and the rats ultimately died of cerebral herniation, usually by 3 weeks after inoculation. The decreased splenic NK cell activity in rats with brain tumors might be the result of neuroimmunomodulation secondary to hypothalamic dysfunction due to increasing tumor compression.\r"

A key issue in such implantation is the configuration of the radiation field in relation to the resected tumor. In particular, should radiation be provided to the area from which the tumor has been resected? To clarify this issue, we evaluated patterns of tumor regrowth into this resected area in 62 patients. Three patterns of computed tomographic scan-documented tumor regrowth were recognized: preferential (regrowth to refill the resected area only), circumferential (regrowth into the resected area and previously uninvolved contiguous brain) and away (local regrowth into noncontiguous brain, sparing the surgical bed). Regrowth of the tumor 6.3 to 6.8 months after resection was seen in 59 of 62 patients (95.2%). Preferential regrowth was seen in 32 of 62 patients (51.6%), and circumferential regrowth was seen in 27 of 62 patients (43.5%). Regrowth away was seen in 3 of 62 patients (4.8%). Radiation fields planned for interstitial brachytherapy must adequately include the resected area because of the high incidence of tumor regrowth into that area.\r"

Because all but 1 of the deaths occurred among the 66 patients unconscious at the time of operation (27% mortality in this subgroup), the authors sought differential factors between comatose and noncomatose patients at operation. There were no significant differences between these groups in age, sex, mechanism of injury, preoperative course of consciousness (lucid interval or not), or epidural hematoma location and shape. In contrast, significant differences were seen between the two subgroups in trauma-to-operation interval, hematoma volume, CT hematoma density (mixed low-high CT density vs. homogeneous hyperdensity), midline displacement, severity of associated intracranial lesions, and postoperative intracranial pressure (ICP). Patients comatose at operation usually evidenced a more rapid clinical deterioration (a shorter trauma-to-operation interval) and tended to have a large hematoma volume, a higher incidence of mixed CT density clot (hyperacute bleeding), more marked shift of midline structures, more severe associated lesions, and higher postoperative ICP levels.\r"

Simultaneously, the other side was labeled with horseradish peroxidase-lectin to reveal lectin binding sites. Specimens were obtained from four human ACTH-producing pituitary adenomas and from nonadenomatous pituitary tissue surrounding three other adenomas. The four ACTH-producing adenomas showed either weak or negative reactions with concanavalin A, whereas the nonadenomatous ACTH-producing pituitary cells reacted strongly with concanavalin A. Moreover, ACTH secretory granules were significantly larger in the nonadenomatous cells than in adenoma cells. Differences in biochemical structure and ultrastructure between nonadenomatous (normal) pituitary cells and adenoma cells secreting the same specific hormones were demonstrated, and the clinical implications of the results were discussed.\r"

Several other arachnoidal membranes that separate the cisterns were identified. These include the anterior pontine membrane, which separates the prepontine and cerebellopontine cisterns; the lateral pontomesencephalic membrane, which separates the ambient and cerebellopontine cisterns; the medial pontomedullary membrane, which separates the premedullary and prepontine cisterns; and the lateral pontomedullary membrane, which separates the cerebellopontine and cerebellomedullary cisterns. The three cisterns in which the arachnoid trabeculae and membranes are the most dense and present the greatest obstacle at operation are the interpeduncular and quadrigeminal cisterns and the cisterna magna. Numerous arachnoid membranes were found to intersect the oculomotor nerves. The neural and vascular structures in each cistern are reviewed.\r"

Plasma bromocriptine and prolactin (PRL) levels were measured hourly for 12 hours, then every 2 hours for 12 hours after each dose. At the end of each study, the vagina was flushed with saline for measurement of residual drug. For comparison of serum PRL levels, six additional women were given 2.5 mg bromocriptine orally. After administration of 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 mg vaginally, plasma bromocriptine was initially detectable at 5.4 +/- 0.4, 4.4 +/- 0.7, and 3.5 +/- 0.6 hours, respectively. For the same vaginal doses, the mean (+/- SEM) peak plasma levels were 555 +/- 164 pg/mL at 12 +/- 0.6 hours, 702 +/- 252 pg/mL at 11.2 +/- 0.9 hours, and 1055 +/- 220 pg/mL at 10.7 +/- 1.7 hours, respectively. After each dose, there was a slow decline in plasma bromocriptine levels, remaining above 50% of peak values at 24 hours. Less than 1% of the administered drug was recovered from the vagina at 24 hours. The pattern of PRL inhibition with all three doses was similar. The mean plasma PRL level decreased by 7 hours, the maximum PRL decrease (64 +/- 3, 75 +/- 1, and 66 +/- 4% after 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 mg, respectively) occurring at 11 hours, and the plasma PRL levels changed little during the remaining 13 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No differences between groups were found on any of the five background measures. All 31 women who considered future pregnancies indicated a preference for chorionic villi sampling, regardless of the procedure they underwent during the study. Women receiving chorionic villi sampling reported significantly greater attachment during the second trimester than did women receiving amniocentesis, who viewed themselves as being less attached than other pregnant women during this period. The findings were interpreted as evidence for attachment suppression among women undergoing amniocentesis.\r"

The risk of mortality was investigated by means of logistic regression analysis including 27 perinatal risk factors as confounding variables. The results showed that infants born after maternal transport to centers had a significantly lower mortality risk. Infants treated in centers after neonatal transport had a lower mortality risk as well, but this was not statistically significant at a .05 level. The results of the study confirm that referral by maternal transport to level III centers offers the best prospects for high-risk preterm infants.\r"

In the gel group, modified Bishop scores improved significantly and in two patients (4%), priming alone induced labor. No uterine hyperstimulation or fetal heart rate abnormalities occurred during priming. Cesarean sections for all indications and those for failed induction were less common in the gel group.

  ".W": "The use of diagnostic ultrasound raises questions regarding its bioeffects upon fetal auditory function. This study was designed to determine whether ultrasound produces changes in the auditory brain stem response in fetal lambs. Near-term fetal lambs were chronically instrumented with electroencephalogram electrodes at the vertex and the right mastoid region. An earphone was secured in the fetal right external ear canal for auditory stimulation. An ATL mechanical sector scanner was used for all ultrasound studies at a spatial peak, temporal average intensity of 15.5 mW/cm2. Auditory brain stem responses were recorded at five and 15 minutes during pulsed-wave ultrasound exposure of the cranium and then 30 minutes after cessation of insonation. Sham experiments (without insonation) were then performed in a similar time sequence to rule out the effects of habituation. There was a consistent decrease in the mean amplitude and a consistent increase in the mean latency of all five wave deflections of the auditory brain stem response during insonation. These changes persisted for 30 minutes following cessation of insonation, after which auditory brain stem response amplitude and latency values returned toward control values. No changes in auditory brain stem response amplitude or latency were observed during sham experiments. We conclude that direct ultrasound exposure of the fetal cranium through the maternal abdominal wall may temporarily influence nerve conduction along central nervous system axonal pathways. This transient influence is reversible, with all values approaching baseline within 30 minutes.\r"

All had singleton gestations and gave no previous history of preterm labor or delivery. They were monitored between 8 and 10 AM while sitting in the clinic waiting area. Uterine activity records, numbered randomly, were transmitted by telephone to a site remote from the hospital. No one having any clinical contact with the participants saw or received feedback regarding the contraction data. Tocodynamometry records were then mailed to another center where they were read by one investigator blinded to all clinical information. The mean contraction frequency during the single hour of weekly testing was significantly greater for the 16 women who developed preterm labor than for women who delivered at term at each point between weeks 28-32. Using greater than six contractions per hour on at least one occasion between 28-32 weeks' gestation as a predictor would have identified 12 of 16 women (sensitivity 75%) who subsequently developed preterm labor. This contraction frequency was noted in 26 of 123 women (21%) who labored at term (specificity 79%; P = .0003).\r"

However, vaginal lesions clinically resembling condylomata may exhibit lesser degrees of nuclear atypia with findings suggestive of, but not typical for, the presence of HPV. The diagnosis and management of such lesions are unclear. We correlated histologic findings with the detection of HPV DNA sequences in 39 vaginal lesions that contained a spectrum of clinical and histologic features suggestive of, or diagnostic for, condyloma. We detected HPV DNA in 63% (N = 22) of lesions with koilocytotic atypia and in 11.7% (N = 17) of lesions that showed some histologic features suggesting condyloma but that lacked koilocytotic atypia. These findings imply that vaginal lesions lacking koilocytotic atypia are not always caused by HPV, emphasizing the need for a conservative approach when the diagnosis of vaginal condyloma is not clear-cut.\r"

The frequency of ipsilateral persistence or recurrence of tumor per ovary subjected to cystectomy in this group of patients was 8%. Both patients with stage III tumors had persistence or recurrence of their tumors. Involvement of the resection margin of the cystectomy specimen and the removal of more than one cyst from an ovary were almost always associated with persistence or recurrence of tumor. Follow-up of the 35 patients showed that despite the occasional complication of persistence or recurrence of tumor, all were alive without evidence of disease 3-18 years after the initial operation, with an average follow-up of 7.5 and a median follow-up of 6.5 years.\r"

The concentration of malignant cells and the surgically documented response to the intraperitoneal treatment were correlated. Twenty-three patients were treated with intraperitoneal cisplatin or alpha-2 interferon (rIFN-alpha 2) after persistent carcinoma was documented at second-look laparotomy. Six patients (26%) had a complete response to therapy, and all of these patients had a malignant cell concentration of less than 10(2)cells/cm2/dL. No responses were seen in patients whose initial malignant cell concentration was greater than 10(3)cells/cm2/dL. Among patients treated with intraperitoneal alpha-interferon, five of 11 whose initial concentration of malignant cells was less than 10(2) cells/cm2/dL responded to therapy, whereas none of the patients whose malignant cell concentration was 10(2) cells/cm2/dL or greater responded. In patients treated with intraperitoneal cisplatin, the initial concentration of malignant cells associated with any surgically documented response was less than 10(3)cells/cm2/dL. A host mesothelial reaction was prominent after intraperitoneal alpha-interferon, but not observed in women treated with intraperitoneal cis-platin. The fluctuating pattern of peritoneal white blood cells documented during therapy did not correlate with response. THe evaluation of peritoneal cytology specimens during intraperitoneal chemotherapy should include a quantitative assessment of malignant cells and reactive mesothelial cells in order to reflect more accurately the histologically documented findings. Initial quantitative cytology appears to correlate with the likelihood of a surgically documented response to intraperitoneal therapy.\r"

All had failed oral tocolytic therapy and were therefore faced with prolonged hospitalization. In this feasibility study, the patients were treated at home and monitored with portable tocodynamometers and home nursing visits. Uterine activity data were transmitted via telephone to the study center and terbutaline pump infusion rates were adjusted accordingly. Terbutaline pump therapy consisted of a combination of low-dose continuous basal infusion supplemented with intermittent high-dose boluses. Total daily drug dosage remained exceptionally low (less than 3 mg/24 hours). The mean gestational age at initiation of therapy was 29.6 +/- 3.7 weeks, and pregnancy was prolonged an average of 9.2 +/- 4.3 weeks. The minimum gestational age at delivery was 37.3 weeks. Patient tolerance was excellent and, in a total 394 patient-days of therapy, there were no significant complications. We conclude that the portable subcutaneous terbutaline pump may be a promising new method for long-term outpatient tocolysis in patients who cannot be maintained on oral therapy.\r"

In this study, 66 patients were treated by excision of peritoneal and/or ovarian endometriosis with the carbon dioxide laser via laparoscopy. Using excisional techniques, we were able to visualize the extent of peritoneal penetration and subperitoneal spread of endometriotic nodules. Further, we obtained histologic confirmation of the disease process in all patients. No patient received postoperative hormonal therapy during follow-up. Follow-up evaluation of these patients revealed relief of the painful symptoms of endometriosis. No long-term complications were encountered.\r"

  ".U": "89015549\r", 
  ".W": "Estradiol (E2) plays a major role in maintaining women's skeletal integrity. Loss of bone mass is a regular occurrence with E2 deficiency, regardless of etiology. Estrogen-dependent bone loss follows a predictable pattern. Initially, it is quite rapid, preferentially affecting trabecular bone, which may decrease by 5-8% annually, whereas compact or cortical bone decreases by 1-3% annually. After 10-15 years of E2 deficiency, the rate of loss each year decreases; however, by that time, skeletal mass may be one-third to one-half of its youthful level. Because of the resultant skeletal fragility, even minimal trauma can produce fractures of the spine and wrist. After an additional 10-15 years of bone loss, hip fractures occur with alarming frequency. Timely restoration of E2 levels can prevent estrogen-dependent bone loss and can reduce significantly the risk of fracture. Studies show that 2 mg of E2 administered orally is an adequate dose; 1 mg will suffice if it is combined with a high dietary calcium intake. High calcium intake without estrogen is not effective in preventing the accelerated loss of bone that occurs in the years immediately after menopause. Long-term studies confirm that postmenopausal women who regularly use estrogen have greater bone mass and fewer osteoporotic fractures. Physicians should be encouraged to treat all estrogen-deficient women, particularly those who appear to be at higher risk for osteoporosis.\r"

  ".U": "89015550\r", 
  ".W": "Endogenous sex steroids seem to exert a major influence on plasma lipoprotein levels. During menopause, endogenous estradiol (E2) levels decrease, and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, which gradually increases with age, rises more rapidly, with mean plasma levels exceeding those of age-matched men. It is surprising that the reduction of endogenous E2 does not appear to influence high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Women who experience early menopause have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease than do premenopausal women of similar age; however, this risk is decreased in women treated with oral estrogens. Oral administration of E2 increases plasma concentrations of estrone, E2, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and decreases plasma concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This effect seems to be dose-dependent. Increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration depends primarily on an HDL2 subfraction increase. It is interesting to speculate that the effects of oral estrogen replacement on plasma lipoproteins might be important in reducing coronary heart disease risk. Sequential addition of progestogens attenuates the effects of estrogen on plasma lipids and lipoproteins to some degree. However, the type and dose of the progestogen are important. Most progestogens derived from 19-nortestosterone, for example, reduce high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and, in higher doses, increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In contrast, progestogens derived from 17-hydroxyprogesterone exert only minor effects on plasma lipoproteins. As with oral contraceptives, the net effect of estrogen-progestogen replacement therapy on plasma lipoproteins depends on the dose and potency of the involved drugs.\r"

Polynomial and piecewise regression of large, medium, and short eyes were used to calculate new formulas for IOL prediction. The Taylor series representation of the theoretical lens power formula was calculated to determine what combination of the variables for IOL power prediction are reasonable to consider in constructing a polynomial regression model. The formulas calculated from the data in this study were compared with other published methods of IOL calculation. In this study, the difference between the postoperative refraction error and emmetropia was independent of the formula used. The exception was the modified Binkhorst formula, which caused greater error. Inclusion of higher order terms in the regression formula or piecewise regression did not reduce the postoperative refractive error.\r"

From the regression equation, a correction was applied to the Hyde Ruler estimates, resulting in 68.2% of the latter falling within 1.22 D or less of the Bausch and Lomb readings. We consider this accuracy to be acceptable for a semi-quantitative intraoperative keratometer, and should allow appropriate suture tensioning during cataract surgery to aid in early visual rehabilitation of the patient.\r"

Immediately after surgery, 43 patients had glaucoma and 14 had hypotony, while seven had glaucoma and 39 had hypotony in the late postoperative period (average follow-up of 1 year). In most cases, the mechanism of intraocular pressure change did not appear to be directly related to the presence of silicone, but rather to the preoperative status of the eye and other aspects of the vitreoretinal surgery. When silicone was a factor, the resulting intraocular pressure appeared to represent a balance between mechanisms obstructing aqueous outflow (pupillary block and the reaction to silicone bubbles in the anterior chamber angle) and mechanisms reducing aqueous production (cyclitic membranes and retinal detachment).\r"

Nine eyes had previous trabeculectomy and three eyes required combined trabeculectomy with ECCE and PC-IOL. The average follow-up period is 1.5 years (range 0.5 to 6 years). The postoperative IOP rise of 8 mm Hg over baseline or above 23 mm Hg was observed in 45 eyes (49.5%). Two eyes needed argon laser trabeculoplasty and one required trabeculectomy to control postoperative IOP elevation. Most of the patients required the same or lesser number of medications for IOP control after surgery. Results suggest that ECCE with PC-IOL may be a relatively safe procedure in cataract patients with preexisting glaucoma.\r"

We have shown that the effects observed are not caused by mechanical resonance. We believe that similar results can be expected for human eyes. The peak pulse amplitudes in artificial eyes of different length were found to increase linearly as a function of the energy transferred into the eye. The peak amplitudes of pulse sequences were found to be only half of those for single pulses of comparable energy. In laser surgery, such sequences can be preferable if they achieve the same effect.\r"

Ocular morbidity attributed to the treatment only included posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSCs) which occurred in 52% of patients. Posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSCs) developed in none of the 15 survivors of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) examined who had received neither long-term systemic prednisone nor irradiation (P = 0.0006).

Conversely, occlusion of corneal vessels may induce conjunctival transdifferentiation on vascularized corneas. To test this hypothesis, the corneal epithelia of New Zealand albino rabbits were debrided 3 mm beyond the limbus with n-heptanol. Sixteen corneas healed by conjunctival epithelium, with vascularization persisting for 20 months, were used in this study. Photochemically induced occlusion of the corneal vessels was achieved by intravenous administration of rose bengal-saline solution (40 mg/kg body weight) with subsequent argon laser irradiation of the vessels (514.5 nm, 130 mW, 63 micron and 0.2 sec). The treated vessels remained occluded in an 18-week study, as confirmed by corneal fluorescein angiography. Corneal clarity and epithelial integrity were improved after treatment. Goblet cell loss and morphologic transformation into a cornea-like epithelium were verified by flat-mount preparations, histology, impression cytology, and immunofluorescence studies using a mucin-specific monoclonal antibody. These results indicate that conjunctival transdifferentiation can be induced on vascularized corneas after occlusion of corneal vessels by photothrombosis.\r"

Patients were asked to compare the number of corpuscles visualized with the blue field entoptoscope with a series of projected slides having progressively fewer drawn corpuscles. To standardize the equipment, the test was performed on 69 patients with varying degrees of macular impairment. Of the patients who selected 120 corpuscles or more, 89% had visual acuities of 20/40 or better, and those who selected 100 corpuscles or less, 82% had visual acuities of 20/50 or worse. The percentages were higher for age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) patients (100 and 85%) than for diabetic patients (33 and 75%). The same apparatus was then used to predict the potential visual acuity in 56 preoperative cataract or YAG-capsulotomy patients. Of the 23 patients with a preoperative acuity of 20/200 or better and who selected 120 corpuscles or more, 100% were 20/40 or better postoperatively.\r"

A disproportionate burden of severe ocular injury was borne by those less than 15 years of age. The work place accounted for 48% of all injuries and 50% of ruptured globes. Automobile repair-related tasks were specifically associated with injury. Sports injuries, although accounting for 3.4% of all injuries, were responsible for 60% of hyphemas and 10% of ruptured globes. Annual direct and indirect costs for these ocular injuries are estimated conservatively at $5 million and a loss of 60 work years. A large burden of preventable eye trauma is borne by both patients and society.\r"

  ".W": "Preoperative and postoperative corneascope photographs of 368 myopic patients undergoing radial keratotomy in the Prospective Evaluation of Radial Keratotomy (PERK) study were optically scanned and digitized. A high-resolution scanning system was developed in order to quantify the preoperative and postoperative corneal shape accurately. Careful analysis of the 72 data points in the nine representative rings demonstrated that corneal topography is best represented by radius of curvature from the center to the periphery. The normal myopic cornea flattens approximately +0.28 mm from the center to the periphery, demonstrating the cornea's aspheric nature. More highly myopic patients in the PERK population (-4.50 to -8.00 diopters [D]) demonstrated corneas that are 0.08 to 0.10 mm steeper than the less myopic population (-2.00 to -3.12 D). Optical zone, patient age, and gender are all correlated to changes in corneal topography after radial keratotomy. In more myopic populations, men have corneas which are flatter than those of women by 0.09 to 0.11 mm in all rings represented on corneoscopy. Highly myopic males also experience more corneal flattening after 3.0-mm optical zone radial keratotomy. Regardless of the optical zone used in radial keratotomy, the resulting corneal topography flattens in all rings. However, the ratio of millimeters of radius of curvature change to diopters of correction is consistent for each ring. The dioptric change observed after radial keratotomy corresponds closely with the millimeters of flattening at the respective rings being examined. The central rings flatten 0.166-mm radius of curvature per diopter of refractive alteration obtained. The largest degree of corneal flattening occurs centrally, 0.72 mm, in the more highly myopic patients who underwent 3-mm optical zone radial keratotomy. The use of smaller optical zones in radial keratotomy produces larger changes in the radius of curvature and, consequently, in the amount of refraction than when larger optical zones are used. When compared with younger patients, older patients with 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 optical zone radial keratotomies experience more central and peripheral corneal flattening. This study of the corneal topography of the myopic population demonstrates that the refractive change resulting from radial keratotomy is related to alterations in corneal topography. The use of similar modifications of the corneal surface may be effective for newer refractive surgical procedures.\r"

There was a statistically significant difference in the amount of decentration in the three fixation groups studied. Capsular fixation provides the best and most consistent centration compared with fixation of both loops in the ciliary sulcus or asymmetrical fixation with only one loop in the capsular sac.\r"

Stereo fundus photography has been used to reduce interobserver variation, but little data have been reported quantifying the level of agreement in these situations. This article examines chance-corrected intraobserver and interobserver agreement for horizontal and vertical cup:disc ratios and width of the narrowest remaining neuroretinal rim on stereo, color, fundus photographs. Intraobserver agreement was substantial to almost perfect for both readers (kappas between 0.82 and 0.86 for horizontal and vertical cup:disc ratios and 0.71 for the neuroretinal rim). Interobserver agreement was also substantial (kappas of 0.71 for horizontal cup:disc ratio, 0.74 for vertical cup:disc ratio, and 0.58 for the neuroretinal rim). Both intraobserver and interobserver agreement were best for glaucoma patients followed by ocular hypertensives and controls. Dichotimizing cup:disc ratios into suspicious or not suspicious using a range of cutoff points (greater than or equal to 0.5, greater than or equal to 0.6, and greater than or equal to 0.7 disc diameters [DD]) had little effect on agreement levels. Estimation of the status of the optic nerve is complex, requiring judgment about the shape and structure of the cup. Agreement is optimized by using stereo photographs, using the same observer and, when evaluating progression, comparing photographs from different points in time at a single sitting.\r"

All 20 patients with active stromal keratitis or keratouveitis improved on acyclovir, all four patients using acyclovir postoperatively were disease-free while on the drug, but only two of the four patients using acyclovir to assist tapering topical medications were successful.

In the initial series, they used eight lenticules 5 to 6 mm in diameter with a central thickness greater than 0.15 mm. These failed 6 days to 6 months after surgery. The second series of five implants 4 to 5 mm in diameter with a thinner central thickness and improved edge design was better tolerated initially, but only two of five corneas remained clear 27 months after surgery. Clinical failure was associated with corneal neovascularization and opacification posterior to the implant or aseptic necrosis of the cornea overlying the implant. In most eyes, the anterior stroma was hypocellular anterior to the implant. Numerous vacuolated keratocytes and scattered eosinophils were detected posterior to the implant. In one case, lipid deposition was confirmed posterior to the lenticule. The authors conclude that solid polysulfone intrastromal implants are not biocompatible with the baboon cornea.\r"

The microscopic features of the tumor included a plump spindle cell population, more polygonal cells, early xanthoma cell transformation, infiltrating lymphocytes and eosinophils, and multinucleated giant cells, the last not exhibiting classic Touton characteristics. The histopathologic differential diagnosis ranged among fibrous histiocytoma, juvenile xanthogranuloma, and eosinophilic granuloma (histiocytosis-X). Results of electron microscopy disclosed abundant rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, a paucity of lysosomes, and no Langerhans' (Birbeck) granules. Immunohistochemistry corroborated the fibrohistiocytic nature of the tumor, because histochemical stains for the enzymes alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and lysozyme, and monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against common leukocytic antigen and S-100 protein, were negative--whereas they would have been expected to be positive in various combinations in the different histiocytic proliferations. Vimentin was identified in the tumor cells; this is an intermediate cytoplasmic filament almost always present in mesenchymal proliferations. The distinctions between fibrous histiocytomas of stromal cell origin and true histiocytic proliferations of bone marrow cell provenance are explored.\r"

All patients showed nystagmus, visual acuity ranged from 20/60 to 20/400, and correction of refractive error provided a mild improvement in vision. Iris pigmentation varied in amount and did not correlate with the visual acuity measurement. Foveal hypoplasia was found in all patients, but variability in macular transparency and vascular architecture was noted. Visual-evoked potentials performed in 11 patients demonstrated excessive decussation of optic fibers. Recognition of this form of oculocutaneous albinism is important because of the associated pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiac manifestations of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.\r"

In 19 eyes (61%), perisilicone proliferation (PSP) developed causing recurrent RDs in 15 eyes (49%). At an average of 5 weeks after surgery, PSP occurred and was characterized by extensive transparent preretinal membranes with denser focal areas. Microscopic examination of five preretinal membranes showed droplets of silicone oil and necrotic cells on the silicone side and glial or retinal pigment epithelial cells, or both, on the retinal side, often in layers separated by extracellular matrix. Silicone oil was present in periretinal membranes removed several months after the intraocular silicone had been evacuated indicating that silicone within cells may persist despite the removal of silicone. The use of silicone oil to provide tamponade in eyes with recurrent PVR is associated with a high incidence of periretinal proliferation that frequently leads to recurrent RD and visual failure.\r"

When compared with actual measured bubble volumes, this technique was found to provide an accurate, noninvasive method for determining true intraocular gas volumes. Using this model, the absorption of nonexpansile concentrations of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and perfluoropropane (C3F8) were found to obey first-order kinetics. Both gases were found to have an intraocular half-life two to three times shorter in aphakic rabbit eyes after total vitrectomy than in phakic rabbit eyes with intact vitreous.\r"

Eight patients spanning three generations had a central nervous system pseudotumor with identical histopathology. Histopathologic analysis of brain tissue shows a characteristic pattern of an unusual vasculopathy without vasculitis characterized by fibrinoid necrosis and resulting in necrosis of white matter with sparing of cortical brain tissue. The pedigree shows an apparent autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with delayed expression of abnormalities.

The authors have determined NMR characteristics of suspected uveal melanomas by phosphorus-31 (31P) NMR spectroscopy of freshly enucleated human eyes. Nuclear magnetic resonance examination was performed at 8.45 Tesla within 90 minutes after enucleation. Enucleated eyes were maintained at 4 degrees C in tissue culture medium during the 30 minutes required for transport. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were obtained within 10 minutes, a clinically acceptable time, using a two-turn 31P surface coil. Spectral parameters included 10-kHz spectral width, 1024 data points, and 0.5-second recycle delay. Phosphorus-31 NMR spectroscopy allowed differentiation of choroidal melanomas from normal ocular structures. Differentiating features include significant peaks in tumor spectra due to the phosphodiesters glycerol 3-phosphoryl ethanolamine (GPE) and glycerol 3-phosphorylcholine (GPC), and the phosphomonoesters phosphorylethanolamine (PE) and phosphorylcholine (PC). These preliminary data are encouraging and suggest that clinical trials at the lower magnetic field strengths available in NMR imaging systems seem feasible and warrant investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Carriers of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa were studied using electroretinographic and psychophysical procedures. Under both dark- and light-adapted (cone-isolated) conditions, electroretinogram (ERG) a-waves of carriers were reduced in amplitude but normal in implicit time, whereas b-waves were reduced in amplitude and delayed in implicit time. Reductions in b-wave amplitudes of the carriers as a group were equivalent for the rod and cone systems. Luminance-response functions for both dark-adapted and cone-isolated b-waves were fit by the Naka-Rushton equation and demonstrated a selective reduction of Rmax; the semi-saturation constant (K) and the slope parameter (n) were normal. Electroretinograms recorded using the brightest stimulus flashes were most effective at distinguishing carriers from normals. Absolute thresholds of the carriers were elevated significantly across the central 40 degrees of the visual field. As a group, the threshold elevations of the carriers were approximately equal for the rod and cone systems.\r"

Over a 7-year period, a consecutive series of 12 eyes in nine patients with peripheral uveitis underwent vitreous surgery. Indications for surgery included persistent dense vitreous inflammation, vitreous hemorrhage, traction retinal detachment (RD), and epiretinal membrane formation. Patients were followed for an average of 22 months. Six eyes (50%) required further surgery after the development of RD, recurrent vitreous hemorrhage, or cataract formation. The preoperative finding most frequently associated with postoperative complications was the presence of active neovascularization of the vitreous base. Final visual acuity ranged from 20/30 to 20/100 showing an average improvement of 5 Snellen lines. Persistent cystoid macular edema significantly limited visual improvement in five patients. Patients undergoing vitreous surgery for management of peripheral uveitis may show a significant degree of visual improvement though multiple operations may be required. Control of active neovascularization is an important factor in limiting postoperative complications and the need for further surgery.\r"

Cataracts developed in all phakic eyes and all corneas with oil-endothelial touch showed band keratopathy within 6 months. Recurrent detachments were noted in 22% of eyes during silicone oil tamponade and occurred in 13% of eyes after the oil had been removed. Other complications associated with the use of oil for vitreous surgery included pupillary block glaucoma (3%), closure of the inferior iridectomy (14%), fibrous epiretinal and subretinal proliferations (15%), pain (5%), and subconjunctival deposits of oil (3%). Without exception, within a period of 1 year the intraocular silicone oil showed some degree of emulsification, suggesting that the physicochemical characteristics of the oil injected may be an important variable in long-term complications.\r"

In phakic and aphakic patients with an intact posterior capsule, the success rate for pneumatic retinopexy improved to 81%. These data suggest that this technique is less effective in aphakic or pseudophakic patients with an absent or ruptured posterior capsule and that careful follow-up to detect new breaks is necessary in all cases. A prospective randomized study is needed to verify these data.\r"

Observations of these patients suggest that prefoveal vitreous cortex contraction is probably the cause of idiopathic macular holes. The earliest sign of an impending macular hole (stage 1) appears to be the development of a yellow spot or halo associated with loss of the normal anatomic foveal depression. No vitreous separation is present. This may resolve or progress to a small, early macular hole (stage 2). This hole gradually enlarged to a diameter of approximately 485 micron. The vitreous usually remained attached or a vitreofoveal separation developed (stage 3). Some eyes had complete posterior vitreous separation (stage 4). The implications for surgical intervention are discussed. A prospective study should be undertaken to confirm these findings and to investigate the feasibility of vitrectomy intervention to peel the prefoveal vitreous cortex in eyes with a stage 1 lesion.\r"

The current study, using electron microscopy, was designed to determine the cellular processes involved in the breakdown of Bruch's membrane in this model. Bruch's membrane was not mechanically damaged by the injection and appeared intact for the first 1 to 2 days after injection. Subsequently, numerous breaks in Bruch's membrane were found associated with invasion of macrophages and fibroblasts; in addition, budding and penetration of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and choroidal endothelial cells into Bruch's membrane were noted. Although it was not proven that these cells, per se, were responsible for the breaks, that these cells actively penetrate Bruch's membrane is a reasonable hypothesis.\r"

An additional 15 asymptomatic patients who were receiving high doses of oral niacin (1.0-6.0 g daily) for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia were evaluated for evidence of subclinical macular disease. None of these patients had cystic or other significant macular changes. Niacin causes a reversible toxic cystoid maculopathy that occurs in approximately 0.67% of patients taking high doses of the drug.

This liposome dye system was used in vitro to evaluate the feasibility of using microwaves as a triggering mechanism for the release of drugs in the anterior chamber of the eye. The in vitro study demonstrated that CF can be released from liposomes in response to a localized temperature rise induced by microwave irradiation. In an in vivo study in rabbits, CF and the antineoplastic agent, cytosine arabinoside, were administered intravenously and selectively released by increasing the temperature of the ciliary body with microwaves. In the eyes receiving liposome-encapsulated dye, the average concentration of CF in the anterior chamber of the heated eyes was 8.0 times higher than in the contralateral unheated control eyes. In the eyes receiving liposome-encapsulated drug, the average concentration of cytosine arabinoside in the aqueous of the heated eyes was 4.1 times higher than the concentration in the contralateral unheated control eyes. The importance of this finding lies in the potential for a new method of targeting the delivery of dyes and drugs to specific sites in the eye.\r"

The histopathologic effects of wavelengths from 560 to 630 nm in juxtafoveal, papillomacular bundle, and nonfoveal areas were investigated. An unexpected observation using high-intensity burns in juxtafoveal and, to a lesser extent, in papillomacular bundle areas was inner retinal damage with 600-nm light. At moderate energy levels, the effect of 600 nm were more comparable with those with other wavelengths and included much less damage to the inner retinal layers. At mild energy levels, the effects were comparable with other wavelengths. During and after the application of the burns, the energy levels and ophthalmoscopic appearances were comparable for each wavelength for the high-, moderate-, and mild-intensity burns. The histopathologic effects of 630-nm light (tuneable dye red) were comparable with those of the standard krypton red (647 nm) laser. Nonmacular and PRP effects were similar with all wavelengths. These results indicate that power levels may need to be reduced when placing 600-nm (orange) laser burns in the macula.\r"

Metastasis developed in 64 patients (8%). The median time from treatment to the diagnosis of metastasis was 2.1 years (range, 3 months to 7.3 years). The liver was primarily involved in 58 (90%) patients. The 5-year cumulative probability of metastasis developing was 20%. Prognostic factors for metastasis developing were quite comparable to those found for patients treated by enucleation and included largest tumor diameter, involvement of the ciliary body, older age, and extrascleral extension. Surgical localization, tumor height, and elevated liver enzymes before treatment were not important factors in the development of metastasis.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-three patients with an arthrographic diagnosis of disk displacement with reduction were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: (I) onlays to maintain disk repositioning, (II) flat occlusal splint, or (III) untreated controls. Guidance for construction of the disk-repositioning onlays was established during arthrography to obtain a recaptured disk position relative to the condyle. The onlays were cemented to the teeth and maintained the new intercuspal position anteriorly and inferiorly. The flat occlusal splint was used at night only and was adjusted to maintain a maximal occlusal contact in centric relation and centric occlusion. Clinical examinations were performed before and after 6 months of treatment. The disk-repositioning onlays improved joint function and reduced joint and muscle pain when compared with the flat occlusal splint and with nontreatment. The signs and symptoms in the flat occlusal splint group were no different from those in the control group. It is concluded that disk-repositioning onlays are effective in reducing pain and dysfunction associated with disk displacement with reduction in patients in whom the disk can be maintained in a normal relationship to the condyle with the aid of such onlays. The symptoms, however, returned when the onlays were removed after 6 months; this raises the question of whether a permanent change in the intercuspal position is necessary for long-term success.\r"

These findings were also correlated with the clinical behavior of 25 cases of CGCG for which follow-up information was available. There was a female predilection for both lesions. The mean ages of patients with CGCG and GCT were 21 and 25 years, respectively. In contrast to CGCG, GCT rarely occurred in persons below the age of 10 years. The only statistically significant quantitative difference between the lesions at the histologic level was the greater number of nuclei in the giant cells of the GCT. There were four significant histologic differences between the two lesions, but 26% of the GCTs were histologically similar to most of the CGCGs and 10% of the CGCGs were histologically similar to most of the GCTs. Five of the 25 patients with CGCG for whom follow-up information was available had recurrences. The average age of those five patients was 11 years, compared to 29 years for those patients without recurrence. All five patients with recurrence were under 17 years of age, and they constituted 45% of the patients in this age group with follow-up. There were no quantitative or histologic differences between the recurrent and nonrecurrent CGCGs that were useful in predicting the likelihood of recurrence. Our findings suggest that the GCT and the CGCG represent a spectrum of a single disease process modified by the age of the patient and the site of occurrence.\r"

Implants could be identified as firm subcutaneous nodules, but after 3 weeks began regressing. At 13 weeks, almost total regression had occurred. Histologically, grafts were well vascularized and there was no evidence of necrosis. Typical multinucleated giant cells disappeared at an early stage. The ultrastructural features of the grafts showed giant cells lying in close association with uninuclear cells, features suggestive of a fusion process. Many cells containing microfilaments at their periphery were identified in the original lesional tissue as well as in the xenografts. These cells strongly resembled myofibroblasts. Collagen bundles were seen within the cytoplasm of stromal cells. The observations suggest that the multinucleated giant cells represent a stimulus-dependent, differentiated end-stage cell population.\r"

Therapy commenced with occlusal adjustment, but this was followed 20 months later by endodontic therapy, which was undertaken because of the suspicion of partial pulpal necrosis with condensing osteitis. A painful condition developed and led first to apicoectomy and then to extraction 2 1/2 years after the start of the endodontic therapy. Light microscopic examination of adjacent hard tissue revealed signs of chronic inflammation on both occasions, and a diagnosis of diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis was made. The pain was not relieved but remained at a tolerable level for 18 months. Then a reexamination of the first radiographs led to a strong suspicion of a benign cementoblastoma. A thorough third operation revealed a small piece of hard tissue in a lacuna of the lingual part of the mandible covered buccally by granulation tissue and inflammatory affected bone. The final histopathologic diagnosis was benign cementoblastoma combined with chronic inflammation.\r"

The arthrographic examination after treatment showed that the disk remained in the superior position in twelve but was again displaced in six patients. Three of the patients with disk displacement manifested no clinical signs, such as clicking or locking; two showed signs of locking; and one had reciprocal clicking. The patients with clicking or locking had more symptoms than the other patients. A retrospective analysis of the pretreatment arthrograms suggested that there could have been a medial component to the disk displacement in four of the six patients in whom the disk became displaced again during treatment. Medial disk displacement were not seen in the patients with a successful treatment outcome. This study suggests that recurrence of symptoms during treatment with disk-repositioning onlays is frequently associated with recurrent disk displacement. The study further suggests that medial displacement of the disk is more difficult to treat.\r"

Standard bacteriologic culturing techniques were employed to assess sterility of the electrode tip following activation. Total time of application of the current and the energy used were recorded on audiotape and later tabulated. The data indicate that the time of energizing and the energy units used are critical in the sterilization of the electrode tip. These results confirm that self-sterilization of the electrosurgery electrode tip occurs, but full confidence is not realized with the time intervals commonly employed in clinical practice. The electrode tip must be considered a potential source of bacterial contamination of electrosurgically managed dental procedures.\r"

Two days after the treatment was stopped the numbers of alpha-hemolytic streptococci had returned to pretreatment levels. Local prophylaxis with vancomycin as a complement to systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis may therefore be useful in the prevention of infective endocarditis.\r"

In addition, the reporting pathologist may make an erroneous diagnosis of a subepithelial vesiculating disorder such as mucous membrane pemphigoid, especially when the clinical history is vague. Eight cases are described that illustrate some of the pitfalls in clinical and microscopical diagnosis of superficial mucoceles.\r"

The same x-ray machine, operated at 70 kVp and 15 mA, was used as the source of radiation for all images. Film/cassette-to-jaw relationship and focal-spot-to-film/cassette distance were standardized. Transmission optical density of the resulting images was determined. The results showed that radiographs with transmission optical densities comparable to those of xeroradiographs could be produced with exposure times approximately 3 times those used for xeroradiographs in the lower part of the range observed. This factor decreased to approximately 1.3 as optical density increased.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 93 cases comprising 132 teeth with signs and symptoms or radiographic evidence of periapical pathoses were treated endodontically and were followed up for a period of 2 years. Nonsurgical management was successful in 84.4% of the cases. Histopathologic examination of tissue specimens from cases in which treatment failed revealed that only 35.7% of the cases involved apical cysts, while the remaining 64.3% involved chronic inflammatory tissue. Interestingly, 50% of the failures were observed at or 1 year after completion of treatment, which stresses the need for long-term follow-up of treated endodontic cases. In this study, a successful outcome did not seem to be dependent on either the nature or the size of the lesion, even though it is true that treatment of larger lesions failed more frequently. There seems to be some individual immunologic response variation, which may influence the final outcome of the treatment. Gyromatic instruments were used in 44 of the 93 cases treated and were evaluated and compared with hand instruments in clinical situations. Gyromatic instruments were found to be more convenient and safer to use, since their use improved visibility and eliminated the risk of the instruments' falling into the throat and being aspirated. They exhibited good flexibility and could easily negotiate curved canals without breaking. Used judiciously, these would be efficient tools in the endodontist's armamentarium.\r"

Sessions were at least 5 days apart. Correlations were sought between analgesic effect and plasma concentrations of either morphine or morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine produced significant reduction in both peak pain intensity and area under the pain intensity curve compared with placebo; the threshold time was significantly increased by morphine compared with placebo. Ibuprofen was statistically indistinguishable from placebo on all three measures of analgesia. Analgesic effect and plasma concentrations of morphine showed significant correlation (P = 0.053).

There were 18 females and 2 males with an average age of 52 years, range 22-76 years. There was no difference found between the 2 solutions in the resultant analgesia measured by the visual analogue scale for pain, pain relief or the pain word score during the 3 h period of the study. No difference was found in the patient's mood which was also measured with the visual analogue scale. Two patients had no analgesia from either injection, 2 patients did not obtain any relief from clonidine and another 2 obtained no relief from morphine. Six patients reported that clonidine was better than morphine, 5 reported that morphine and clonidine were the same and 3 reported that morphine was better than clonidine. The duration of analgesia from the clonidine varied from 6 h to 1 month; the duration of analgesia from morphine varied from 6 to 24 h. Clonidine was associated with sedation and a fall in blood pressure of greater than 20 mm Hg in all patients, 1 patient required ephedrine to treat hypotension. Twelve patients had pruritus, 7 nausea and 2 vomiting following the morphine. Statistically there was no difference found between morphine and clonidine for short-term (3 h) analgesia in these patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The dorsal horn of the thoracic spinal cord of the affected side was atrophic from T4 to T8, with loss of both myelin and axons. Despite this, only the T8 ganglion was affected by fibrosis and cell loss and only the nerve roots at that level appeared affected. Markers of unmyelinated afferents (substance P), substantia gelatinosa neurons (opiate receptors), glial cells (glial fibrillary acidic protein), and descending spinal projections (dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and serotonin) were not different at affected versus non-affected spinal cord levels. The pain of PHN may result from the uninhibited activity of unmyelinated primary afferents as a result of the loss of myelinated afferent fibers and the possible presence of hypersensitive neurons in the dorsal horn.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this paper is to identify potential risk factors for the temporomandibular pain and dysfunction syndrome (TMPDS). The investigation focuses on the relations of TMPDS to personal, social and recent experiential factors, especially health behaviors and physical illnesses and injuries, that contribute to life stress. The data come from a retrospective case-control study of 151 TMPDS patients and 139 healthy controls. Results show that cases and controls are similar on most measures of personality characteristics although cases are somewhat more external in locus of control expectancy and appear far more distressed than do controls. There are no case/control differences in reports of desirable and undesirable life events that do not involve physical illness and injury. The social situations of cases and controls differ in that cases have fewer sources of emotional support than controls. No differences were found in the proportion of cases and controls who reported that they ever ground or clenched their teeth, although cases were told they do so more frequently by dentists than were controls. Excluding never married women, cases were less likely than controls to have children. This could not be explained on the basis of birth control and may provide a clue to a biologic base for the much higher rates of women than men who are treated for TMPDS. Cases reported more past pain-related illnesses, more life-threatening physical problems and more recent events involving injury and non-pain-related physical illnesses. There was no difference between cases and controls in reports of physical problems prior to age 13. TMPDS patients appear to be unusually distressed individuals who are beleaguered by physical illnesses and injuries as well as by pain, who tend to attribute their fate to external factors, and who have fewer sources of emotional support.\r"

In the present study, 40 chronic low back pain patients and 40 matched non-patient controls were compared on lumbar paravertebral EMG during mechanically stabilized static and dynamic postures. Differences between groups in lumbar curvature and spinal range of motion were determined using a dual goniometer technique. Although the two groups did not differ on absolute levels of EMG during quiet standing, significant differences were found for EMG patterns during dynamic postures. In addition, most patients did not show the flexion-relaxation response or the expected pattern of EMG responses during trunk rotation, most likely because of restricted range of motion and/or compensatory posturing. These findings provide support for the biomechanical model of chronic pain and indicate the need for further research pertaining to pain behavior and movement-related lumbar muscle activity.\r"

Thirty-nine women reporting either PMS and premenstrual severe low back pain (group 1), PMS with premenstrual moderate low back pain (group 2), or those reporting neither condition (group 3) participated. During each of 3 menstrual phase-specific assessment sessions, participants were exposed to a neutral stimulus, an experimentally induced stressor, and 2 personally relevant stressors in a randomized order. Concomitant monitoring of low back EMG activity and heart interbeat interval was undertaken. Results indicated that participants in group 1 evidenced greater EMG changes in response to personal stressors compared to the neutral stimulus and experimentally induced stress during the premenstrual phase. EMG activity in response to personal stress was also significantly higher during the premenstrual phase than during the menstrual and intermenstrual phases for group 1, and higher than EMG changes evidenced by groups 2 and 3 during the same phase. Group 2, while not reporting as severe premenstrual back pain as did group 1, reported moderate levels of back pain and evidenced greater physiological reactivity to a personal stressor than did group 3. The findings highlight the link between personally relevant stressors and concomitant physiologic responsivity and the role that this arousal may play in the maintenance and exacerbation of premenstrual low back pain.\r"

This paper examines the types of coping strategies used by two groups of persistent pain sufferers: one from a family practice clinic and the other from a specialty pain clinic. The relationship between the use of different types of coping strategies and adjustment was determined. The two study groups of persistent pain sufferers differed significantly from each other on many of the indices developed to tap adjustment but did not differ on any of the Billings and Moos original categories of coping strategies. When a factor analysis of coping items was performed, 5 valid clusters relevant to the chronic pain patient samples were determined. The factor the authors entitled 'adversarialness' with the qualities of dysphoric withdrawal, avoidant behavior and catastrophizing was found to explain adjustment defined by several indices. The authors conclude that it may be important to help persistent pain sufferers to alter their attitudes and behavior that tend toward catastrophizing, avoidance and withdrawal, rather than simply concentrate on trying to teach them techniques for 'coping with stress.'\r"

We confirmed the finding that patients with fibrositis, despite having significantly less demonstrable pathology, report more pain on a significant number of measures. In patients with arthritis, we observed large positive correlations between scores on different pain measures, supporting the hypothesis that these scores validly measure pain secondary to tissue injury. In the fibrositis group, however, significantly lower correlations, and one even strongly negative, were found between scores on different measures. We suggest that commonly used pain measures which have been shown to be valid to study patients with demonstrable pathology may be less valid for measurement of pain in patients with syndrome such as fibrositis, whose pain may be different or more complex than that of patients with explicable organic basis.\r"

The sample consisted of 54 patients and 31 dentists. Key pain descriptors from each cultural context were selected for construction of pain assessment instruments which allowed multidimensional statistical techniques to translate these data into cross-cultural quantitative indices. Results revealed dimensions of pain which were universal in all cultures examined. These included time, intensity, location, quality, cause and curability. More culture-specific dimensions included the Chinese concept suantong, a multidimensional concept of bone, muscle, joint, tooth and gingival pain. 'Real' and 'imagined' pains were contrasts described by Western subjects, especially dentists; 'imagined pain' being the conversion of fear or anxiety into perceived pain. These data indicate that the data gathering and data analytic methods were reliable and sensitive to cultural variables and that ethnicity played a stronger role in determining perceptions of pain description than professional socialization for this population sample of Chinese and Western subjects.\r"

In behavioural experiments conscious rats were exposed to the same experimental procedure. After ischaemia the threshold tail temperature required to elicit both a neuronal response and aversive behaviour in conscious rats, to thermal stimulation, was decreased significantly (P less than 0.01 paired t tests). Threshold temperatures for the neuronal response and the behavioural response were not significantly different, either before or after ischaemia. The time course of recovery to pre-ischaemic threshold temperatures was the same for both the behavioural and neuronal responses. Most thalamic neurones responding to noxious thermal stimulation of the tail also increased firing rate during ischaemia. The latency of response of the thalamic neurones to ischaemia was 12.1 +/- 1.8 min and the latency of the behavioural response to the same stimulus was 11.9 +/- 2.1 min. Ventrobasal thalamic neurones, therefore, which responded to noxious thermal stimulation of the tail also responded to noxious ischaemia, and exhibited a neuronal correlate of post-ischaemic hyperalgesia which paralleled behavioural responses closely.\r"

  ".W": "Morbidity and mortality of asthma has been on the upswing since the 1960s, as marked by increased hospitalizations with asthma since the early 1980s. This has not been explained adequately. The possibility of change in the natural history or increased exposure to environmental irritant chemicals or allergens has been suggested by some. There probably has been better recognition and diagnosis of asthma by distinguishing it from bronchitis, recurrent croup, and bronchiolitis in children. Despite evidence to suggest that this is the case, there are still some missing factors. The increase in asthma mortality is more understandable when one considers the fact the management of asthma has changed greatly in the past two decades. The use of corticosteroids orally, parenterally, and by inhalation has been a double-edged sword. There is no doubt that many asthmatics have a much improved sense of well-being and have lived more normal lives due to the use of corticosteroids. The inability of some patients, parents, or physicians to perceive impending respiratory difficulty, however, may result in underuse of drugs, including corticosteroids, leading to increased mortality. Other factors have led to increased mortality from asthma in recent years, and they include arrhythmias with combinations of theophylline, beta-agonists, and hypoxia. The psychological factors attendant to adolescence and psychological problems are probably quite important in the recent upsurge in asthma deaths in the 15- to 25-year age group. Many deaths are occurring outside of the hospital environment and may be largely preventable. There must be increased awareness by the patient, the family, and the physician. In view of the increased hospitalizations, the total number of deaths is not increasing at an alarming rate, yet it is necessary to make all of us who care for asthmatics aware and take corrective action as soon as we are aware of an asthmatic with respiratory problems.\r"

Transmission of U. urealyticum to the low birth weight infant may contribute to neonatal respiratory disease. We studied prospectively 111 infants with birth weights of 2 kg or less who were consecutively admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit during a 7-month period. The infants had eye, throat, vagina and/or rectum cultured for U. urealyticum on days 1, 3 and 7 and weekly thereafter until the time of discharge. Forty-six infants (41%) had at least one culture site positive for U. urealyticum (eye, 9%; throat, 35%; vagina, 34%; and rectum, 13%). Respiratory distress at birth was not associated with U. urealyticum colonization. However, colonization with U. urealyticum was significantly associated with the development of chronic lung disease. Of the infants colonized with U. urealyticum 30% developed chronic lung disease, whereas 8% of those not colonized developed chronic lung disease (P less than 0.05). Duration of positive pressure ventilation and oxygen therapy could not account for the higher incidence of chronic lung disease in the infants colonized with U. urealyticum. Stepwise logistic regression analysis using the profiles of birth weight, need for intubation and status of colonization with U. urealyticum correctly identified 79% of the infants who developed chronic lung disease. Additional studies serologic techniques are needed to confirm the association of U. urealyticum colonization and chronic lung disease in low birth weight infants.\r"

Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated significantly more frequently from gastric aspirates and nasopharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates from 43 infants developing CLD than from 56 who did not (51% vs. 16%; P less than 0.005). Infants developing CLD, defined by radiographic and blood gas abnormalities, were significantly younger (26 vs. 29 weeks; P less than 0.0001), weighed significantly less (830 vs. 1050 g; P less than 0.0001) and required more ventilatory support (37 vs. 10 were being ventilated and 42 vs. 26 received oxygen supplementation on Day 7) compared with those who did not develop CLD. Viruses were isolated in association with U. urealyticum in two infants developing CLD and in one infant who did not develop CLD. Mycoplasma hominis was isolated from three infants who were colonized with U. urealyticum and developed CLD. Chlamydia trachomatis was not recovered from any patients. From a discriminant analysis it was found that U. urealyticum contributed to the development of CLD along with the effect of ventilatory support, gestational age and severity of initial respiratory disease. The effect of interventions directed against U. urealyticum on the development of CLD deserves further study.\r"

The overall duration of the catheter courses was 30,533 days (median, 171; range, 2 to 647). Sixty-five percent of the catheter courses (102 of 157) were complicated by at least 1 febrile episode, for a total of 157 episodes. According to European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer criteria, 79 febrile episodes (50%) were classified as microbiologically documented infections, 57 (36%) with and 22 (14%) without septicemia; 31 (20%) as clinically documented infections; and 47 (30%) as possible infections. Of the 79 microbiologically documented infections 21 were catheter-related infections (CRI), 32 were catheter-unrelated infections and 26 were infections of unknown source. Only 48% of CRI occurred during neutropenia (less than 1000 neutrophils/mm3), compared with 88% of catheter-unrelated infections and 96% of infections of unknown origin (P = 0.00007). Gram-positive microorganisms (56% staphylococci) accounted for 78% of all isolates in CRI, 47% in catheter-unrelated infections and 43% in infections of unknown origins (P = 0.03). Fungi represented 12% of all isolates. Clinical and microbiologic resolution without removal of the catheter was achieved in 12 of 21 CRI (57%) and no patient died from a CRI. This study indicates that over 3 of 4 of CRI are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, occur in neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients (approximately 50%) and can be successfully treated without removing the catheter.\r"

Repeated fecal specimens were obtained from these patients and examined for the presence of rotavirus by means of immunoassay, electron microscopy and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Asymptomatic rotavirus shedding was observed in each of the 16 patients, and more than 1 episode of virus excretion was detected in 15 of these. Electropherotype analysis indicated that some of these episodes were probably the result of reinfection with different strains of rotavirus. Asymptomatic shedding may be important in transmission of rotaviruses. Its role should be taken into consideration in future investigations of the epidemiology and control of this nosocomial pathogen.\r"

During the years 1981 to 1985, 100 children younger than 13 years old with community-acquired bacterial meningitis were hospitalized. Seventy-one patients were younger than 12 months. The principal bacteria isolated were Haemophilus influenzae 42%; Streptococcus pneumoniae 29% and Neisseria meningitidis 20%. The case fatality rate was 12%. The chance of acquiring meningitis during the first 5 years of life was twice as common among Bedouins than among Jews (328/100,000 vs. 173/100,000, respectively; P less than 0.0001). The most common cause of meningitis during the first year of life was S. pneumoniae among Bedouins and H. influenzae among Jews. Meningitis caused by H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae was usually associated with respiratory morbidity during fall and winter among Jews, but with diarrheal morbidity during summer and fall among Bedouins. Since the most prevalent type of morbidity among Jews results from respiratory infections and among Bedouins from diarrhea, our findings suggest that community-acquired bacterial meningitis is associated with the type of morbidity most prevalent in the community at any given season rather than with a specific type of infection.\r"

A total of 119 infants were identified and the neonatal oxygen requirements of these infants were compared with those of 486 infants who had normal pulmonary function. A requirement for oxygen at 28 days of life had a positive predictive value for abnormal pulmonary findings at the time of follow-up of only 38%, whereas 31% of those with normal pulmonary findings at the time of follow-up were still receiving oxygen at this age. The need for oxygen at 28 days was a good predictor of abnormal findings in infants of greater than or equal to 30 weeks' gestational age at birth but became increasingly less useful as gestational age decreased. It was found that, irrespective of gestational age at birth, the requirement for additional oxygen at 36 weeks' corrected postnatal gestational age was a better predictor of abnormal outcome, increasing the positive predictive value to 63%. The prediction of a normal outcome remained 90% for infants not receiving oxygen at this corrected gestational age.\r"

The trial was controlled, the infants were randomized, and the investigators were unaware of the group assignments. Patients with minimal (grade I) or no periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage determined by prestudy echoencephalography were randomized within two birth weight subgroups (500 to 899 and 900 to 1300 g) to receive either prophylactic indomethacin (n = 99) or an equal volume of saline-vehicle placebo (n = 100). The first dose (0.2 mg/kg) was given within 12 hours of delivery and two subsequent doses (0.1 mg/kg) were administered at 12 hourly intervals. Prophylactic indomethacin significantly reduced the incidence of grades II to IV periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage was half as common in infants given prophylactic indomethacin as in control infants (23% v 46%, P less than .002). The reduction was manifested in both birth weight subgroups. Results of this study also confirmed a lower incidence of clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus in infants who received prophylactic indomethacin in contrast to those who received placebo (11% v 42%, P less than .001). No significant differences were found between treatment and control groups in the duration of oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, or hospitalization or in the incidence of pneumothorax, chronic lung disease, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, or death. Early prophylactic indomethacin initiated within 12 hours of delivery is effective in reducing the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage as well as clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus in very low birth weight premature infants.\r"

Mortality among infants during their first year of life decreased from 1 in 6 in 1900 to 1 in 100 in 1986. Between 1900 and 1984 the annual death rate for children 1 through 4 years of age decreased from 1 in 50 to 1 in 2,000, for children 5 through 14 years of age, from 1 in 250 to 1 in 4,000, and for persons 15 through 24 years of age, from 1 in 165 to 1 in 1,000. Public health measures, advances in medical science, legislative initiatives, and the organization and delivery of health care have all contributed to these improvements in varying degrees during different decades. For the decade 1975 through 1984, the overall death rate decreased by 20%, with declines for all causes except suicide, cardiovascular diseases, and renal diseases. All of the surgeon general's mortality reduction goals for 1990 for America's youth should be reached except those for infant mortality and suicide. Improvement in these death rates will require better access to health care by those in need and reductions in environmental stress.\r"

Fifty-seven were further evaluated at 11 years of age. Six categorical outcomes were defined a priori, based on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised IQ and discrepancies between Verbal and Performance scores and Bender Gestalt Test score. Proportions at 8 years of age were: 4.6% very low IQ (below 70), 13.9% low IQ (70 to 84), and, for those with IQ greater than 84, 12.0% language disability, 12.0% performance disability, 21.4% visual-motor disability, and 36.1% normal. Learning disabilities, determined by discrepancies between IQ and Wide Range Achievement Test scores, included 16.7% of all children. Outcome proportions at 11 years of age were essentially comparable to those at 8 years of age; outcome constancy was present in 52.6%. Ratings of neonatal illness and parent education level strongly influenced the likelihood of outcome at 8 years of age. When ratings were dichotomized (ie, low v high neonatal illness and low v high parent education), the level of neonatal illness primarily influenced the likelihood of normal outcome, whereas the level of parent education influenced the degree of severity of the disability.\r"

Cellular DNAs extracted from exfoliated cervical cells were examined for human papillomavirus genomic sequences by Southern transfer hybridization using 32P-labeled human papillomavirus DNA probes. Human papillomavirus sequences were detected in 12 (13%) young women, abnormal cytologic specimens in 21 (24%), and vulvar condylomas in 12 (13%). The human papillomavirus types identified included HPV-6/11 (four instances), which is known to be associated with benign lesions, and HPV-16, -18, and -31 (eight instances) which are considered to have oncogenic potential. Two young women were infected with both HPV-16 and -31. Human papillomavirus sequences were found in 48% of the young women with abnormal cytologic findings and in 3% of patients with normal cytologic findings (P less than .0001). Condylomatous changes in the cervical smear were associated with the presence of HPV-6/11 and mild dysplasia with the presence of HPV-16, -18, and -31. The presence of vulvar condylomas correlated with condylomatous changes in the cervical smear and with the recovery of HPV-6/11 from the cervical epithelium. The results indicate that the prevalence of human papillomavirus infections in this population is high and that a majority of the infections are with viruses associated with lower genital tract malignancies.\r"

Determination of hypoxanthine level was done with either a PO2 electrode method or high-performance liquid chromatography. The results obtained by both methods were significantly correlated; therefore they were pooled. The median hypoxanthine level in victims of SIDS (380 mumol/L) was significantly higher (P less than .001) than in the children who died violently (118 mumol/L). Moreover, the levels from the SIDS victims were significantly higher (P less than .001) than those from the neonates who died without long-standing hypoxia (53 mumol/L). It is concluded that SIDS is probably not a sudden event but may be preceded by a relatively long period of respiratory failure and hypoxia.\r"

By 2 years of age, developmental delays in speech and language often became evident, and speech therapy was often necessitated in the preschool years. Early school problems included speech and language deficiencies, lack of coordination, poor academic performance, and immature behavior; these persisted throughout the school years. By high school age, a 47,XXX girl was generally tall and often subject to somatic complaints. Sexual development was generally normal. Seven of the 11 propositae had a diagnosed psychiatric disorder or disturbance at some time during adolescence.

Although the predicted relationships between overactive behavior, decreased concentration, and injury rate were not found, the hypothesis of an increased risk of injury for boys and for children with discipline problems was confirmed. Also, the association between male sex and injury remained after controlling for the behavior variables related to injury. In general, some support was found for the suggestion of increased risk of injury among children who have specific behavior problems, although, contrary to widespread belief, this relationship accounts for only a small percentage of the injuries found in the cohort. Moreover, the relationship is modified by maternal characteristics and by the sex of the child. Unexpectedly, encopresis and marked fears were found to be risk factors for injury, although these effects were relatively small.\r"

Adoption of this procedure not only increases the comprehensiveness and quality of care but is economically justifiable in the current reimbursement environment and reinforces the primary care physician's function as a cost-effective manager of the patient's health. Rhinolaryngoscopic examination using a flexible fiberoptic ENT endoscope is simple to learn, and the diagnostic yield is far superior to that obtained with traditional rigid right-angle telescopic laryngoscopes. Rhinolaryngoscopy is an ideal area in which primary care physicians can extend their clinical expertise with maximum benefit to both their patients and themselves.\r"

  ".W": "Urinary incontinence in women is common and can be a significant social problem. The most common type is stress incontinence, caused by displacement of the bladder neck and urethra and experienced during activities that increase intraabdominal pressure. Other types are urge, overflow, and mixed incontinence. Diagnosis of the type and cause can usually be made using simple, cost-effective office procedures. Nonsurgical treatment is often successful and may consist of pharmacologic management, intermittent self-catheterization, Kegel exercises, and use of a mechanical device.\r"

Patients often use this ability to attract attention to themselves. Since the dislocations are painless and are performed at will, surgical intervention is not required. Proper treatment involves preventing repetition of the dislocations and providing emotional support for the patient.\r"
