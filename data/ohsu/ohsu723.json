  ".W": "Cryptosporidium causes a disease in infant macaques that is clinically, histologically, and microbiologically indistinguishable from that seen in young children. A reproducible experimental model of cryptosporidiosis has been developed in pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) and used to studied the infectious dose of oocysts and the effect of inoculum size on severity of disease. Inoculation with either 2 x 10(5) or 10 oocysts via nasogastric tube resulted in clinical enteritis and the fecal passage of large numbers of cryptosporidial oocysts in all four primates studied. The size of the inoculum had no apparent effect on the severity or duration of disease. Rechallenge 2 weeks after resolution of the primary infection demonstrated partial acquired immunity. The small inoculum size coupled with the passage of large numbers of oocysts contributes to the highly contagious nature of cryptosporidiosis among captive primates and may be relevant to the epidemiology and control of cryptosporidiosis in humans.\r"

Furthermore, pretherapy isolates were sensitive to a range of zidovudine concentrations when 100% inhibition was used as the end point. The loss of zidovudine susceptibility did not correlate with any clinical or virologic consequences in this small group of patients.\r"

Fifteen infected infants were asymptomatic; 3 had diarrhea. Neutralization antibody (NA) was assayed in two asymptomatic infants who had a serotype 1 isolate identified. Seven asymptomatic infants had sera available for analysis; none had IgG, 1 had IgM, but 4 had IgA antibody responses. Neither tested infant had a serotype 1 NA rise. In the 3 symptomatic infants, 1 had IgG, 2 had IgM, and all had IgA serum antibody responses detected. Eleven (73%) of 15 asymptomatic and all symptomatic infants had a rotavirus-specific fecal antibody response. These findings identify IgA as an important antibody in primary rotavirus infection in very young infants. The predominance of this antibody in asymptomatic infants suggests that their responses (and protection on subsequent reexposure) may be primarily mucosal.\r"

Patients with systemic fungal diseases treated with itraconazole served as controls. Serum erythropoietin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay and amphotericin B by high-performance liquid chromatography. Despite anemia in all amphotericin B-treated patients, erythropoietin levels declined or remained relatively constant during therapy while erythropoietin levels in controls were appropriate for the degree of anemia. Within 2 weeks of completion of amphotericin B treatment, two patients had increasing erythropoietin levels in response to anemia. Amphotericin B appears to suppress but not abolish the erythropoietin response to anemia; this effect disappears quickly after discontinuation of the drug.\r"

In addition, the clinical outcome of the patients in each protocol was examined. After 3 days of culture in basal medium, fresh medium with or without androstenedione (A) (10(-7) M) was added for 24 hr, at which time medium was obtained for measurement of progesterone (P) and estradiol (E) content. Follicular fluid (FF) P, E, and A were measured in each follicle and compared among protocols. FF from individual follicles in patients stimulated with FSH contained higher levels of P compared to FF from patients stimulated with hMG or CC/hMG, while E was higher in patients stimulated with CC/hMG compared to FSH or hMG. FF levels of A were not significantly different among the protocols. In vitro steroid secretion revealed a progressive increase in P secretion in contrast to decreasing E secretion when one compares CC/hMG, hMG, and FSH. Patients undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation with FSH had significantly more atretic oocytes identified at the time of oocyte harvest compared to patients undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation with CC/hMG or hMG. The hMG protocol yielded significantly fewer fertilized oocytes, cleaved embryos, and transferred embryos, compared to the CC/hMG and FSH protocol, however, there was no significant difference in pregnancy rate among the three protocols. These data demonstrate that individual follicles contain G-L cells with markedly different abilities to luteinize in vitro as assessed by steroid secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The TESTY-treated spermatozoa penetrated the oocytes much more successfully than the spermatozoa treated by the standard technique. Although the penetration levels achieved by the two methods were significantly correlated, the correlation coefficient was too low to predict the penetration outcome from one technique to the other. More consistent results were obtained when different ejaculates from the same donor were treated by TESTY than by the standard technique. Spermatozoan penetrating ability was more strongly correlated with sperm concentration, motility, and morphology after treatment by the standard technique than after TESTY treatment. Much larger differences in penetration were present between normal and abnormal ejaculates when the standard technique was used than TESTY.\r"

This study proves the efficacy of low-dosage variable-length estrogen replacement therapy for preparing the endometrium for embryo implantation in patients suffering premature ovarian failure. These studies confirm earlier observations that sequentially increasing doses of estrogen during the follicular phase are unnecessary for implantation and that the length of the follicular phase within certain undefined limits is not critical. A second important observation arising from this study concerns the relative effectiveness of the route of administration of progesterone. Five of seven patients became pregnant after receiving vaginal pessaries, compared to none of seven following intramuscular injections.\r"

Heart rate decreased significantly from 135 +/- 5 to 120 +/- 5 beats/min (p less than 0.001) with R76, to 127 +/- 7 beats/min (p less than 0.01) with H76, and to 130 +/- 6 beats/min (p less than 0.05) with ISO in left coronary angiographies; more profound decrease was observed in right coronary angiographies from 134 +/- 4 to 87 +/- 18 beats/min (p less than 0.001) with R76, to 99 +/- 14 beats/min (p less than 0.001) with H76, and to 125 +/- 7 beats/min (p less than 0.01) with ISO. In 12 left coronary angiographies bradyarrhythmia was observed in five cases with R76, two with H76, and none with ISO. In seven right coronary angiographies it occurred in six with R76, three with H76, and none with ISO. The differences in the incidence of bradyarrhythmia between R76 and ISO were significant during left and right coronary angiographies (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively). Thus ionic contrast media produced more marked bradyarrhythmias than nonionic contrast media in coronary angiography, especially R76. Right coronary angiography resulted in more profound bradyarrhythmias than left coronary angiographies. This study suggested that nonionic contrast media (ISO) might be preferable to ionic contrast media (R76 or H76) for coronary arteriography.\r"

Recent evidence has suggested that renal function is also compromised in the stenosed kidney of patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis. The long-term consequence of this reduction in renal function is not known. We have studied the effect of chronic ACE inhibition with enalapril on renal structure and function in rats with the two-kidney one-clip model of renovascular hypertension. Four weeks after placement of a clip on the left renal artery, hypertensive rats were randomized to treatment with enalapril, minoxidil, or to a no treatment group. Twelve months later split kidney function was determined by chromium 51-labeled ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid clearance in surviving rats. Clearance of the clipped kidney was 0.0 ml/min (enalapril group), 0.26 +/- 0.23 ml/min (minoxidil group), and 0.74 +/- 0.13 ml/min (untreated group). The clipped kidney from the enalapril treated rats weighed much less than the minoxidil group or the untreated group (0.46 +/- 0.1 gm, 1.2 +/- 0.07 gm, and 1.14 +/- 0.10 gm, respectively). Enalapril treatment was stopped for 2 weeks in five rats. The clipped kidney remained small and nonfunctional. Histologic examination revealed marked interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy of the clipped kidneys from the enalapril treated group in contrast to minor changes in the minoxidil treated and untreated groups. After 12 months of treatment, survival in the enalapril group was 84%, 48% in the minoxidil group, and 15% in the untreated group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To study limitations of the erythropoietic response in AB donors we have conducted a prospective analysis of 72 consecutive adult AB donors scheduled for orthopedic surgery. The data in this report indicate that endogenous erythropoietin response is inadequate in at least 58% of AB donors who are successful in predonating the requested amount of AB and that AB donors with lower initial body iron reserves relative to the amount of blood requested have a greater risk of deferral; 15 of 45 female patients (33%) were unable to predonate the requested amount of AB. Lower circulating red cell volumes (reflecting anemia at first blood donation, smaller body size, or both) and/or lower storage iron pools are contributing factors in this population. This report also indicates that a significant number of AB units have red cell volumes below minimum standards for blood donation, which has important implications in a risk/benefit analysis of whether nontransfused AB units should be \"crossed-over\" for HB transfusion, and that future studies designed to maximize AB procurement should include an evaluation of recombinant erythropoietin therapy in AB programs and therapeutic alternatives to ferrous sulfate as iron supplementation in AB donors.\r"

We compared the spontaneous release of TNF by alveolar macrophages (AMs) from patients with symptomatic pulmonary sarcoidosis, some of whom were receiving corticosteroid therapy, with AMs from control smokers. TNF was released from AMs of sarcoidosis patients at significantly higher levels than was released by control AM subjects (sarcoids, 15 U/ml [0 to 1140 U (median [range]]); controls, all less than 5 U/ml, p less than 0.01). By using a specific polyclonal antibody, the detected TNF was found to be TNF-alpha. Among the sarcoidosis patients, the amount of TNF released was significantly lower for those patients given treatment with corticosteroids (5 U/ml [0 to 15 U/ml]) compared with untreated persons (50 U/ml [0 to 1140 U/ml], p less than 0.05). In vitro studies demonstrated that incubation of peripheral blood monocytes or AMs with dexamethasone for 42 hours suppressed subsequent release of TNF. We conclude that AMs from sarcoidosis patients often spontaneously release TNF and this release is suppressed by prolonged corticosteroid therapy.\r"

Anticoagulant activities were evaluated as the ability of the compounds to catalyze the inhibition of thrombin in the presence of heparin cofactor II in a purified system and to prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time or the thrombin clotting time of human and rabbit plasmas. On the basis of weight, low molecular weight dermatan sulfate was two times less potent than unfractionated dermatan sulfate. After bolus intravenous injection into rabbits, the volume of distribution of low molecular weight dermatan sulfate was 10 times larger than that of unfractionated compound, and the half-life of disappearance was two to four times longer despite a 1.4 to 2.3 times higher total clearance. The bioavailability of low molecular weight dermatan sulfate from its subcutaneous depot was 100%; it was absorbed faster from that depot than unfractionated dermatan sulfate. The antithrombotic activities of unfractionated and of low molecular weight dermatan sulfate were also examined with a Wessler-type model with tissue factor as the thrombogenic stimulus. When evaluated 3 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection, unfractionated dermatan sulfate was twice as active as low molecular weight dermatan sulfate on the basis of weight. With subcutaneous injection, 10 mg/kg of low molecular weight dermatan sulfate generated an activity in plasma equivalent to 5.6 micrograms/ml 1 hour later. This concentration was associated with a significant antithrombotic effect that lasted for less than 6 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In order identify the uremic toxins responsible for the suppression of the calcitriol synthesis, we studied the effects of known uremic toxins: spermidine, spermine, methylguanidine (MG), and guanidinosuccinic acid (GSA) on calcitriol metabolism in the rats. Metabolic clearance rate (MCR) and production rate (PR) of calcitriol were measured in normal rats after they were infused for 24 hours with approximately 10 ml of normal saline containing one of the following substances: 0.8 mumoles spermidine, 0.3 mumoles spermine, 150 micrograms MG and 180 micrograms GSA. Control groups of rats were infused with 10 ml of normal saline for 24 hours. MCR of calcitriol was not altered by the infusion of each toxin; however, plasma concentration of calcitriol (controls, 105.3 +/- 6.7 pg/ml; versus GSA, 58.9 +/- 2.5 pg/ml, p less than 0.001) and PR of calcitriol (controls, 39.0 +/- 2.9 ng/kg/day, versus GSA, 22.5 +/- 1.62 ng/kg/day, p less than 0.001) were significantly suppressed by the infusion of GSA. The concentration (1.8 mg/dl) of GSA in the infusate was similar to that in the uremic plasma ultrafiltrate (2.32 +/- 1.41 mg/dl) used in the previous study, though the total amount of GSA infused to the rats was lower in the present study. GSA is, therefore, considered a uremic toxin that suppresses calcitriol synthesis.\r"

These proteins, designated ghilantens, were co-purified on DEAE-cellulose and heparin-agarose, and were purified by microbore C-18 reverse-phase HPLC. Each variant had a similar molecular weight (18,000), amino acid composition, and a blocked amino terminus. Ghilantens caused a dose-dependent prolongation of the prothrombin time of normal human plasma and blocked the factor Xa-mediated hydrolysis of methoxycarbonyl-D-cyclohexylglycyl-glycl-arginine-p-nitro anillide acetate. Ghilantens were quantitatively absorbed to bovine factor Xa-AffiGel-15 and were eluted with 0.1 mol/L benzamidine, an active-site reversible inhibitor of factor Xa. These findings show that ghilantens can form a reversible association with the enzyme. When administered intravenously to mice by tall vein injection, ghilantens potently suppressed lung metastases of B16-F10 melanoma cells. These findings suggest that ghilantens may have therapeutic value in the treatment of metastatic disease.\r"

To investigate whether these proteins might contribute to the modulation of the intraluminal airway inflammation associated with chronic bronchitis, lactoferrin and lysozyme were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from 22 subjects with chronic bronchitis and, for comparison, with 10 symptom-free smokers and 16 normal subjects. As a further control, transferrin, a protein structurally homologous to lactoferrin but not known to arise in airway epithelial cells, was also measured. BAL was performed by sequentially instilling and retrieving five 20 ml aliquots of normal saline solution into each of three sites. Analyzing the first aliquots separately from the later four provided fluid that was enriched for airway contents. The concentration of lactoferrin (11.83 +/- 2.86 micrograms/ml vs 0.68 +/- 0.18 micrograms/ml, p less than 0.00001), and lysozyme (6.75 +/- 1.51 micrograms/ml vs 0.52 +/- 0.09 microgram/ml, p less than 0.00001), but not transferrin (3.22 +/- 0.38 microgram/ml vs 2.68 +/- 0.24 micrograms/ml, p = 0.55) was higher in the bronchial sample lavage fluid, suggesting an airway origin for lactoferrin and lysozyme. In subjects with chronic bronchitis, bronchial sample lactoferrin (23.1 +/- 0.5 micrograms/ml) and lysozyme (12.6 +/- 3.5 micrograms/ml) were elevated compared with the normal subjects' lactoferrin (1.9 +/- 0.5 micrograms/ml, p less than 0.0001) and lysozyme (0.77 +/- 0.22 microgram/ml, p less than 0.0001) and the symptom-free smokers' lactoferrin (4.1 +/- 0.8 micrograms/ml, p = 0.005) and lysozyme (4.9 +/- 1.3 micrograms/ml, p = 0.02). Transferrin concentrations did not demonstrate the same relationships. Finally, when the content of bronchial sample lactoferrin and lysozyme were compared with the content of bronchial sample neutrophils, poor correlations were found, which may imply an airway epithelial origin for the two proteins. Thus lactoferrin and lysozyme appear to arise in the lower respiratory tract within the airways and their levels are elevated in association with chronic bronchitis. This suggests that lactoferrin and lysozyme may contribute to the modulation of airway inflammation in chronic bronchitis.\r"

When PMNs were treated with the membrane-perturbing agent butanol at concentrations up to 0.25%, chemotaxis of the fastest PMN population in response to 10(-7) mmol/L FMLP was increased to 140% of control, whereas the mean of all populations was increased to only 110% of control. These data show that the PMN population at the leading front has a different chemotactic sensitivity to FMLP. Furthermore, the susceptibility to butanol treatment of the PMN population suggests that an alteration in membrane properties may partly account for this difference.\r"

SHRs and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats as a control strain were given daily injections of subcutaneous AMNS (1 mg/100 gm body weight) and intravenous PS (two separated doses of 2.5 mg/100 mg body weight) for 4 days; they were killed on day 80 after three series of injections at 10-day intervals. The levels of urinary protein, serum creatinine, and urea nitrogen in SHRs given AMNS and PS were elevated throughout the experiment and were significantly higher than these levels in other control groups on day 80. Histology in SHRs given AMNS and PS showed advanced FGS associated with glomerular hypertrophy and widespread interstitial fibrosis. Most small arteries and arterioles showed \"onion peel\" thickening and fibrinoid necrosis of the intima, which is characteristic of malignant arteriosclerosis. We observed that the gradient of glomerulosclerosis increased from superficial to deep cortical zones; this phenomenon had often been reported in human FGS. However, these distinguished lesions were not found in control groups. Therefore, it is suggested that systemic hypertension is one of the deleterious factors enhancing histologic and functional deterioration in FGS.\r"

We investigated the anticoagulant effects and pharmacokinetic behavior of detergent-solubilized purified rabbit thrombomodulin labeled with iodine 125 when intravenously injected into rabbits. Thrombomodulin half-life (t1/2) was determined by tracking the 125I-radiolabeled protein and the biologic activity as determined by the prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and thrombin clotting time (TCT). When 200 micrograms/kg 125I-thrombomodulin was injected into rabbits, the APTT and TCT were immediately prolonged, whereas no effect on the prothrombin time was seen. In vitro calibration curves enabled us to convert the prolongations of the clotting times into micrograms per milliliter thrombomodulin equivalents. The best fit (r greater than 0.99) for the disappearance curves was provided by a two-compartment model with mean t1/2 alpha (distribution phase) of 18 minutes for 125I, 12 minutes for APTT, and 20 minutes for TCT, and mean t1/2 beta (elimination phase) of 385 minutes for 125I, 460 for APTT, and 179 for TCT. The administration of two doses of endotoxin (50 micrograms/kg) 24 hours apart did not accelerate the turnover rate of 125I-thrombomodulin as measured by the disappearance of 125I from the circulation. Thus, detergent-solubilized purified thrombomodulin administered intravenously circulates in a biologically active form for appreciable time periods.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment efficacy of various antimicrobial regimens against anaerobes was studied in semipermeable chambers simulating a closed-space, locally neutropenic infection site in rabbits. Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were inoculated (at a mean of 5.3 log10 CFU/ml in prereduced pooled rabbit serum) into the chambers (one isolate per chamber) in triplicate. Antimicrobial therapy consisted of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole (against the gram-negative anaerobes), or penicillin G (against the gram-positive anaerobes), beginning 4 hours after organism inoculation and continuing every 6 hours for 16 doses. With the use of anaerobic techniques for specimen acquisition, transport, and culture, quantitative bacterial findings were measured at the start of therapy and at various time points thereafter. Antibiotic concentrations were measured in blood and chamber fluid by liquid chromatography or bioassay methods. At the end of the study in vivo organisms were reduced by at least 3 log10 CFU/ml from drug-free growth control chambers by all the antimicrobial regimens tested except for cefoperazone against B. fragilis and ciprofloxacin against the three isolates tested. The addition of sulbactam to cefoperazone inhibited B. fragilis beta-lactamase activity and eradicated B. fragilis in vivo. In vivo results with this model confirmed in vitro susceptibilities of all tested antimicrobials except ciprofloxacin and should provide useful indications of the potential clinical efficacy of other new agents against anaerobes.\r"

  ".W": "Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) has been identified as an important determinant of glomerular permselectivity. We have previously reported that glomerular epithelial cells in culture synthesize HSPG, suggesting that in vivo these cells contribute to the HSPG present in the glomerular basement membrane. In this study we examined the effects of dexamethasone on the metabolism of HSPG core protein in cultured glomerular epithelial cells. Dexamethasone caused a dose-dependent and time-dependent increase in the HSPG core protein content of the cells. This effect was not seen with an equimolar concentration of aldosterone, indicating it was selective for dexamethasone. Dexamethasone caused a significant inhibition in 3H-leucine incorporation into de novo synthesized proteins at concentrations that caused maximum increment in the HSPG core protein content. These findings support the interpretation that HSPG core protein is a selective target for dexamethasone. Actinomycin-D completely abrogated the dexamethasone effect on HSPG core protein content, implying that enhanced transcription may be the major mechanism underlying the dexamethasone-induced increment in HSPG core protein content. Our findings suggest that glucocorticoids have important effects on the metabolism of the core protein moiety of heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Furthermore, these data imply that the glucocorticoid-induced amelioration of proteinuria could involve metabolic effects on the local determinants of glomerular permselectivity (e.g., HSPG) in addition to their well-known systemic anti-inflammatory effects.\r"

  ".W": "Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) accumulates in the heart during myocardial ischemia. This amphiphile accelerates Ca++ flux in cardiac myocytes and may mediate ischemic cell injury. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of LPC on the contractility of cultured neonatal rat heart cells. We also investigated the interactions between LPC and other prominent features of the ischemic milieu, acidosis, and superoxide radical. A photo-optical technique was used to measure the maximum velocities of shortening and relaxation (dS/dt and dR/dt) of cultured cells superfused with 0.1 to 100 mumol/L LPC. LPC, at all concentrations, initially increased dS/dt. After 1 minute, however, dS/dt decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in cells superfused with greater than 20 mumol/L LPC. The effect of LPC on relaxation was also dependent on LPC concentration. dR/dt increased at less than 40 mumol/L LPC but decreased at greater than or equal to 60 mumol/L LPC. Acidosis markedly potentiated LPC-mediated depression in dS/dt and dR/dt. In contrast, superoxide dismutase entirely prevented LPC-mediated depression of contractility. We conclude that whereas brief exposure to LPC stimulates contractility, prolonged exposure to greater than 40 mumol/L LPC depresses dS/dt and dR/dt in cultured myocytes. The depressant effects of LPC on contractility are potentiated by acidosis and superoxide radical. We postulate that LPC accumulation in the myocardium contributes to ischemia-mediated contractile dysfunction.\r"

We investigated binding of whole S. aureus organisms to preparations of isolated porcine cardiac valve proteins. Cultured endothelial and subendothelial cells were surface labeled with iodine 125. After preabsorption with Escherichia coli, an organism that only rarely causes infective endocarditis, binding of surface proteins to S. aureus was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent autoradiography. The results showed that cardiac valve endothelial cells expressed a major S. aureus-binding protein with an approximate apparent molecular weight of 120,000. In contrast, cardiac valve subendothelial cells expressed on their surface a single species of binding protein with an approximate apparent molecular weight of 220,000; immunoblot analysis suggested that this protein was fibronectin. We also used radiolabeled S. aureus to probe cellular proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. This technique identified a 125,000 molecular weight protein that bound S. aureus in endothelial cell extracts. We conclude that specific S. aureus binding to cardiac valve cells is mediated by different receptors for endothelial and subendothelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were undertaken to evaluate the in vitro properties of recombinant human secretory leukocyte-protease inhibitor (rSLPI) that had been made in Escherichia coli in an inactive form and refolded, and to determine whether emphysema and bronchial secretory cell metaplasia, induced in hamsters by intratracheal treatment with human neutrophil elastase (HNE), could be amelio-rated by prior intratracheal instillation of rSLPI. Chromatographic studies indicated that 3H-rSLPI formed a 1:1 complex with HNE. Blockage of the active site of HNE by a covalently bound tetrapeptide chloromethyl ketone reduced complex formation with 3H-rSLPI by more than 98%. Incubation of 3H-rSLPI-HNE complex with alpha 1-protease inhibitor for 3 hours at 37 degrees C decreased the amount of complex compared with incubation in the presence of bovine serum albumin (70% vs 27% dissociated). The calculated dissociation rate constant was 1.1 x 10(-4) sec-1, indicating a 1.8 hour dissociation half-life. Dissociated 3H-rSLPI retained its ability to recombine with HNE. rSLPI was as effective at inhibiting HNE released from stimulated neutrophils as 3H-rSLPI was at inhibiting purified HNE. Intratracheal pretreatment of hamsters with 3000 micrograms of rSLPI as long as 8 hours before the intratracheal instillation of 250 micrograms of HNE, resulted in significant protection against induction of emphysema and secretory cell metaplasia. One and 4 hours after instillation of rSLPI, 59% and 44%, respectively, of the initial functional activity was recovered in lung lavage supernatant, indicating a half-life of approximately 2 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined production of inositol phosphates by platelets from these hypercholesterolemic rats to determine whether the enhanced responsiveness to thrombin is associated with increased production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3). The opportunity to study rats with hypercholesterolemia determined genetically or induced by diet makes it possible to determine whether any differences in inositol phosphate production are caused by hypercholesterolemia alone rather than to any other effect of the diet used to induce hypercholesterolemia. Platelets were prelabeled with [3H]inositol so that increases in inositol phosphates (IP, IP2, and IP3) upon stimulation with thrombin could be assessed by measuring the amount of label in these compounds. Platelets were preincubated with CP/CPK, to inhibit effects of released ADP, and aspirin, to inhibit formation of thromboxane A2/endoperoxides. In platelets from rats with either form of hypercholesterolemia, the percentage increase in labeling of IP3 was significantly greater 30 seconds after stimulation with low concentrations of thrombin than in platelets from control rats. Increased IP3 formation in platelets from hypercholesterolemic rats indicates that there is increased activity of a pathway(s) leading to IP3 formation and that this may be a mechanism responsible for the thrombin-induced hypersensitivity of these platelets.\r"

These methods were used to revisit the primary calcification front of the fetal otic capsule between 16 and 23 weeks gestational age. Ultramicroscopic evaluation demonstrates similar fetal bone formation to that found in other bones of the human fetus. The formation of the endosteal and periosteal layers is a typical example of early intra-membranous ossification. The enchondral layer is made up of fibrillar bone, laid down around the calcified cartilage remnants. Microchemical analysis indicates a significantly higher Ca/P ratio in the endochondral layer with respect to the endosteum and periosteum. The consequences of a lower Ca/P ratio in the endosteal layer are discussed in view of calcium homeostasis and inner ear function.\r"

Guinea pigs were exposed to a 3.85 kHz pure tone at an intensity of 120 dB for 22.5 minutes. The first detectable change was a disarrangement of the cilia with a loosening of the interconnections. The ciliary plasma membrane presented with an abnormally smooth appearance. The tip links connecting the tips of the stereocilia to their taller neighbours were also affected showing elongation or even disappearance. The fine granules which cover the tips of the tallest stereocilia of the outer hair cells were decreased. These findings suggest that acoustic overstimulation may affect the carbohydrate metabolism exceeding to degeneration of ciliary interconnections resulting in a disarrangement and detachment of cilia. The tip links, which may participate in sensory cell transduction, seem also to be affected by acoustic overstimulation.\r"

The test uses auditory brain-stem response (ABR) techniques to estimate the basilar membrane travelling wave velocity (TWV). The underlying hypothesis is that raised pressure in the scala media will lead to an increase in the stiffness of the basilar membrane and that this will give rise to a travelling wave velocity that is greater than normal. It was considered that verification of the technique could be obtained by carrying out the new test before and during a glycerol dehydration procedure. Patients who required this procedure for verification of the diagnosis or as a prognostic indicator for sacculotomy, underwent the following tests. Prior to dehydration an audiogram, the ABR TWV test and a blood sample (for plasma osmolality) were taken. The patient was then given the appropriate amount of glycerol mixed with lemon juice and laid on a bed in a test room. The audiogram and a blood sample were repeated every hour and the ABR TWV test was repeatedly carried out every twenty minutes between the other tests. Six of these procedures have been carried out. In five of them the 0.5 and 1 kHz average threshold improved by at least 10dB and in all those cases the ABR TWV test showed an abnormal pre-dehydration result which moved towards the normal value following dehydration. One patient gave ABR TWV results that were within normal limits before and during the procedure and gave an audiometric change of only 5dB.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All perforations were small and limited exclusively to the pars tensa. In 85 per cent of the patients, the perforation was located in the anterior-inferior quadrant. It had smooth margins enabling free drainage of pus-and was associated with a favourable clinical course. In the remaining 15 per cent of the cases, the perforation was located in the posterior-superior quadrant. It had a nipple-like shape with a tiny opening that did not allow pus to drain sufficiently from the middle ear. The perforation closed in 94 per cent of the patients within one month. The healing process was gradual and following perforation closure, there was evidence of middle ear effusion for some time before normal aeration was regained.\r"

Patients suffering from chronic otitis externa and those receiving radiotherapy to the head and neck also have an increased susceptibility to such infections. Many advocate the use of waterproof ear protectors in such patients when swimming. The choice of a suitable ear protector is complicated as many are now available commercially. This study was therefore designed to evaluate the degree of protection afforded by seven different ear protectors in a group of six swimmers. A very sensitive, original method of water detection was devised incorporating a pH indicator strip. The results showed conclusively that cotton wool coated in paraffin jelly BPC was the most effective method of ear protection and was found to be comfortable and easy to use. Other methods, including custom-made silicone rubber plugs, were not adequate in sealing the external auditory canal and are considerably more expensive.\r"

'Classical' mastoiditis was often seen before the antibiotic era, had serious complications and was cured by mastoidectomy. After the introduction of antibiotics, the number of cases of 'classical' mastoiditis decreased and was replaced by a more prolonged condition called 'latent' mastoiditis. Lately in Oslo, we have seen an increase in numbers of 'classical' mastoiditis and at the same time a decrease in the incidence of 'latent' mastoiditis. A four year study of patients with 'classical' mastoiditis is described.\r"

  ".W": "It is almost impossible to establish the natural history of Meniere's disease and, by the same token, it is difficult to confirm the efficacy of endolymphatic sac surgery. The authors doubt the logic of sac operations. Only two controlled trials of sac surgery have been found and both cast doubt upon its value. There do not appear to be any controlled trials indicating that it works. In 14 cases of incapacitating Meniere's disease, where vestibular nerve section was indicated, cortical mastoidectomy was offered and accepted in the expectation that two-thirds might be spared the more major procedure. In the event, the vertigo was controlled in eight out of 14 (57 per cent), the remaining six (43 per cent) requiring more major surgery. A surgical model illustrates that, of themselves, these results are essentially meaningless in assessing the efficacy of cortical mastoidectomy in Meniere's disease. Until all cases in a community are considered and followed-up, we shall be in doubt about the value of sac surgery and most other treatments of Meniere's disease.\r"

Only one diploid myoepithelioma had a high S-phase fraction. Both flow-cytometric parameters are good predictors of an aggressive biological behaviour. Recurrences, however, were all the outcome of incomplete primary removal of the myoepitheliomas. Four of the twelve (33 per cent) diploid myoepitheliomas recurred and one, with high S-phase fraction, led to the death of the patient. Two of the three (67 per cent) aneuploid myoepitheliomas recurred. Extensive loco-regional invasion by one killed the patient. The other has clinical evidence of distant metastasis.\r"

We started the external rhinoplasty approach with some reservations, however in a series of over seventy cases, no significant problem has been encountered, with the columellar scar. Accurate approximation of the columellar wound is probably a more important factor in wound healing than the skin colour. Our experience of external rhinoplasty is presented.\r"

The haemorrhage could only be stopped with the aid of an ear insert and a nasopharyngeal balloon catheter. The balloon catheter was removed the following day but the girl had to use an ear insert for a total of 76 days following myringotomy because of repeated haemorrhage from the ear. The subsequent investigation using CT and angiography revealed an aberrant internal carotid artery in the middle ear. It is concluded that the one most important factor in the handling of these cases is to be aware of the existence of aberrant internal carotid arteries and to have a high degree of suspicion when encountering any abnormal clinical or radiological findings which might point in the direction of vascular abnormalities. The failure to detect this condition before any surgical intervention on the affected ear can have disastrous consequences. The method of choice in handling these cases is one of avoidance of middle ear manipulation in order not to cause haemorrhage from the aberrant artery.\r"

The mean platelet volume was significantly greater than in the controls (11.26 +/- 1.29 fl vs. 8.93 +/- 0.93 fl, P less than 0.001), and normalization generally occurred on the forty-fifth day. The mean platelet count was significantly lower in the patients who died than in those who survived (P less than 0.025 and P less than 0.05 respectively on the first to second and fourth day after infarction). The reduction of platelet count and the increase of mean volume appear to be related to an increased platelet consumption in the infarction area, associated with an in vivo platelet activation, as larger platelets are more responsive to platelet activity and aggregability tests. The lower mean platelet count observed in the patients who died suggests that the platelet value might be considered as a prognostic index of cerebral infarction.\r"

This study was designed to prove or disprove the effectiveness of Dextran-haemodilution in intermittent claudication. Twenty claudicants with long, well-collateralized arterial occlusions were randomized into groups 1 and 2. Group 1 received isovolemic haemodilution with Dextran 40 (500 ml per session) during 3 weeks, which was followed by a wash-out period, followed by placebo treatments for 3 weeks. In group 2 this sequence was reversed. Pain-free and maximal walking distances were measured by standardized treadmill tests along with plethysmographic blood flow, Doppler pressures, haematocrit, blood and plasma viscosity as well as fibrinogen. Walking distances increased significantly by about 50% during haemodilution in both groups. This was paralleled by a fall in haematocrit and blood viscosity. All other variables remained constant. During placebo treatments there were no significant changes of any variable. The treatment was tolerated without complications. Thus Dextran-haemodilution seems safe and effective in selected peripheral occlusive arterial disease (POAD) patients. Potential responders might be identifiable before the start of therapy by angiographic investigations. The clinical effectiveness of Dextran 40 is comparable to that of hydroxyethyl starch 200 as reported in the literature.\r"

In the present project this hypothesis was tested using four repeated observations every third month in a group of 44 men working in six widely different occupations. On each occasion scores of self-reported demands and decision latitude were calculated for every participant. An earlier report has shown that systolic blood pressure during work hours--an indicator of mobilization of energy--increased with increasing job strain (ratio between demands and decision latitude). Blood samples were drawn in the morning at the work site. For each man the plasma testosterone levels--representing the general level of anabolic activity--on the two occasions with the worst strain (ratio between demands and decision latitude) were compared with the plasma testosterone levels on the two occasions with the least strain. The results indicated that total plasma testosterone (but not free testosterone) levels increased when strain diminished in sedentary but not in physically demanding work. Subjects with a family history of hypertension showed a greater decrease in testosterone levels than others when job strain increased.\r"

Two patients (one refractory, one relapsing) showed a partial response, defined as a 50% reduction of the serum M-component. Three further patients had a minor, significant but short-lived response. Subjective side-effects grade 1-2 were noted during rh-IFN therapy in all patients. In three cases thrombocytopenia necessitating platelet transfusions occurred.

In Klaksvik the prevalence of hand handicap was about 40%, which is due to the high incidence of osteoarthrosis. The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis was 1.1%. The high functional capacity and the lower occurrence of rheumatic nodules and erosions found in the patients with rheumatoid arthritis as compared with previous studies suggest that the disease takes a milder course in Klaksvik. This should support the hypothesis that RA patients benefit from a diet rich in fish.\r"

On admission and over the next 3 days the concentration of CK-BB was significantly increased in patients with brain death and other neurological sequelae compared with those with favourable outcome. There was a variation in time in concentrations of CK-BB between diseases causing neurological sequelae. Thus, cerebrovascular haemorrhages caused highest concentrations on admission, but cerebral ischaemia due to cardiac arrest caused highest concentrations 3 days after admission. On admission the CK-BB measurements were highly specific with high predictive value of positive result when distinguishing patients with brain death and other neurological sequelae from those without complications at discharge. However, when distinguishing patients with brain death from those with other neurological sequelae, the test was most specific and had highest predictive value of a positive result 3 days after admission.\r"

In general the best effect of CyA was seen in patients with minimal change disease and in those who had normal kidney function before CyA was initiated. CyA-induced nephrotoxicity was observed in four patients. There was no correlation with the duration of CyA therapy. Hypertension was accentuated and required multidrug treatment in five patients. This side-effect tended to be most pronounced among patients with reduced kidney function at onset of CyA therapy. In conclusion, CyA is effective in the treatment of severe steroid resistant adult nephrotic syndrome. For most patients in the present study, CyA reduced proteinuria by at least 70% to less than 3.5 g of protein per day in 8 of 10 patients; only two patients were unresponsive to CyA treatment.\r"

Smoking and non-smoking diabetic patients did not differ in attitudes towards the disease, psychological well-being, extent of tedium, frequency of self-controls of blood glucose or proportion of patients with any sick leave in the preceding 2 years. In a case referent study of 25 matched patients with good or poor metabolic control, exposure to smoking was significantly more common among those with poor control (odds ratio 6.0).

It should be determined whether a mild hypervolaemic haemodilution with hydroxyethyl starch or Ringer lactate can produce a further increase in walking distance. For this purpose, three groups of 25 patients each were formed. One group exercised three times weekly and the second group, in addition to exercise, underwent a mild hypervolaemic to isovolaemic dilution therapy with HES for a period of 6 weeks. In the final group the haematocrit was reduced to the same extent by venesections and volume substitution using Ringer lactate. The walking distance in the HES group increased from 216 m to 311 m (44%), in the Ringer lactate group from 214 m to 258 m (20%), and in the exercise group from 213 m to 242 m (14%). On comparison of the groups, the increase in pain-free walking distance in the HES group differs significantly (P less than 0.05) from that achieved in the other groups. It was demonstrated that haemodilution with HES in combination with exercise brings about a clinical effect three times that achieved by exercise alone. Venesection with subsequent administration of Ringer lactate and exercise is superior to exercise alone but markedly inferior to the combination therapy with HES.\r"

Secondly, the strength of association between asthma and low or subnormal plasma ACT concentration, in first and second degree relatives to heterozygotes, was assessed. The prevalence of asthma among first degree relatives of women with heterozygous alpha 1-antichymotrypsin deficiency was significantly higher [prevalence ratio 3.22 (1.06-9.83), P = 0.04]. Among heterozygotes, the prevalence of asthma in first and second degree relatives with low plasma alpha 1-antichymotrypsin concentration was higher than in relatives with normal plasma ACT concentration, but the difference in prevalence did not reach statistical significance [prevalence ratio 3.1 (0.96-9.83), P = 0.059].

Recurrence of the hiccups occurred several hours later, and again, they were terminated immediately with digital rectal massage. No other recurrences were observed.

  ".W": "To identify predictors of mortality, the records of 133 elderly patients with pneumonia admitted to a small rural midwestern hospital were examined using a retrospective cohort design. All recorded clinical information available to the patient's physician within the first hours of admission was reviewed. Twenty-one (15.8%) patients died during the hospitalization. Patients with preexisting coronary heart disease, dementia, urinary incontinence, and impaired mobility were more likely to die. Impaired mental status, absence of fever, rapid respiratory rate, hypotension, cyanosis, and diffuse abnormalities on chest examination were also associated with mortality. Logistic regression analysis revealed five predictive indicators of mortality: impaired level of consciousness (odds ratio [OR] = 11.3), tachypnea (OR = 10.8), temperature lower than normal (OR = 14.2), white cell count higher than 20 X 10(9)/L (20,000 mm-3) (OR = 12.2), and cyanosis (OR = 8.6). A risk score based on this regression model demonstrated that 1 of 95 patients with a score lower than 3 (1%), 7 of 22 with a score of 3 (32%), and 13 of 15 patients with a score higher than 3 (87%) died during their hospitalization. The validity of this risk-scoring system was confirmed in another sample of 40 patients. Studies such as this may be useful in identifying information of important prognostic value that enables physicians, patients, and family members to make more effective decisions.\r"

Each physician was presented with an identical set of five clinical scenarios and asked to make an HIV screening decision in each case. The physicians were also asked to choose from a list of 11 physician roles the one role that best described why they chose to recommend or not recommend an HIV screening test in each particular scenario. Marked variation was observed among the physicians' HIV screening recommendations. The degree of variation was similar between residents and clinical faculty. The physicians predominantly cited concern for the patient's well-being over concern for the public's well-being in making their HIV screening decisions. Three physician roles, (1) to protect the patient from mental suffering, (2) to protect the unborn from disease, and (3) to optimize the patient's future health care, were the roles most cited when an HIV screening test was recommended. Two physician roles, (1) to protect the patient from mental suffering, and (2) to allocate limited health resources properly, were the roles most cited when an HIV screening test was not recommended.\r"

These instruments may also be helpful in longitudinal evaluation of patients with known progressive dementias. The case for screening will be substantially stronger when an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease is found. To avoid inappropriate labeling of patients, abnormal results on a mental status questionnaire must be interpreted with caution. A thorough history is the most effective diagnostic strategy to differentiate progressive dementia from a delirium or a reversible chronic problem. An abnormal score on a mental status screening instrument should never be equated with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. To document the usefulness of mental status screening in office practice, more research is clearly needed. While the value of traditional secondary prevention maneuvers may decrease in the very old, routine, careful assessment of function may prove to assist the family physician in offering important benefits to elderly patients and their families.\r"

  ".W": "Although the long hours worked by resident physicians have raised concern in the public, legislators, and members of the medical profession, the consequences of sleep loss on the ability of residents to perform in clinical settings is unknown. The present study examined the effects of various amounts of reported sleep on cognitive performance measured by the American Board of Family Practice in-training examination. A total of 353 family practice residents in 21 programs who took the examination in Pennsylvania in 1988 were studied. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a statistically significant (P less than .05) decline in composite test score with decreasing sleep on the night before the examination for residents in each year of training. Loss of one night's sleep resulted in changes in test scores that were approximately equivalent in magnitude to the change that occurred in test scores between residents in the first and third year of training. The results suggest that prolonged testing over several hours may be necessary to detect the subtle but significant differences in cognitive performance that are present with relatively mild degrees of sleep loss.\r"

Preintake medical conditions, family conflict, and lack of family support predicted poorer treatment outcome. Moreover, patients' family conflict and confidant support at intake interacted with the amount of treatment to influence outcome. Patients who had a close confidant and less family conflict showed better outcome with brief therapy; patients who lacked a confidant and had more family conflict experienced better outcome with longer treatment. Posttreatment stressors and lack of social resources were associated with poorer treatment outcome. The findings imply that treatment can provide temporary support to compensate for a lack of social resources. More intensive treatment may be needed for patients who experience more family conflict and who have a poor relationship or no relationship with a confidant.\r"

Depression was assessed with a short form of the MMPI, the Brief Symptom Inventory, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. By Research Diagnostic Criteria, most suffered from major (59%) or minor (21%) depressions; some degree of cognitive impairment was seen in 80% of the patients, defining a population of \"vulnerable\" geriatric patients typical of referrals to a general medical hospital setting. Using both conventional score cutoff criteria and discriminant analyses, false-negative rates up to 53% for major depression and 100% for minor depression were found. Psychometric misrecognition of depression was not related to degree of dementia or education but on some measures was positively associated with verbal intelligence level and patient age. Contrary to previous suggestions that psychometric measures overestimate depression in the elderly, these findings suggest that there may be a subgroup of elderly in which treatable affective distress is not appreciated.\r"

Hypothesized psychosocial predictors included depression, mood disturbance, life happiness, affect, pessimism, self-esteem, knowledge of renal disease and its treatment, perceived control over important life domains, perceived intrusiveness of ESRD into important life domains, illness-related concerns, difficulties in daily activities, number of regular leisure activities, somatic symptoms of distress, social networks, recent negative life events, and defensive response styles. Methodological controls were incorporated to test the prognostic significance of these variables and included a) exclusion of deaths attributable to \"unnatural\" causes; b) multivariate statistical controls for physical and demographic determinants of survival; c) widely used standardized psychosocial instruments; and d) temporally aggregated psychosocial measurements to enhance reliability. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses identified four variables as significant and independent predictors of increased survival times in ESRD: a) comparatively fewer serious nonrenal comorbid illnesses; b) younger age; c) regular involvement in an increased number of leisure activities; and d) overall life happiness described as \"an even mixture of unhappiness and happiness\" (as compared with \"very happy\"). However, no evidence was obtained to support the hypothesis that increased depressive symptoms and/or moods contribute to compromised survival in ESRD.\r"

Low REM density was found in the diabetics with REM density correlating with measures of tumescence. These results suggest that central autonomic dysfunction may be a contributing factor in the impotence of diabetic men. A metabolic disturbance in the central nervous system of diabetics which might alter both sleep and autonomic nervous system activity is proposed to explain these results and may help in the understanding of other observed abnormalities in both the sleep and autonomic dysfunction of diabetics.\r"

Fifty schizophrenics (14 drug free), 50 depressives (20 drug free), and 50 normal controls receive four trial blocks involving the same sequence of 16 1000- or 2000-Hz tones delivered to either the right or left ear. A subsample of each group (N = 14) receives all blocks as a simple habituation series; others (N = 36) have to press a pedal for designated target signals (left ear or right ear, 1000 Hz or 2000 Hz), ignoring all nontarget tones. On each trial block, a new target signal is defined, and previous targets are discarded. Skin conductance and finger pulse amplitude analyses are presented. Both patient groups show enhanced ORs to newly relevant targets and ceased ORs to newly irrelevant former targets as well as normals. Both show OR decline with target repetition despite reminders and new targets.\r"

Clinical deterioration, or a new TIA or stroke was more likely (p = 0.01) during the 24 hours after heparin was stopped in patients not already on aspirin or warfarin (10/143, 7%) than in patients receiving aspirin or warfarin before heparin withdrawal (3/215, 1%). Stopping heparin in patients not receiving aspirin or warfarin appears to expose them to an increased risk for TIA, stroke, or clinical deterioration.\r"

The slices were subsequently embedded in paraffin-wax or celloidin and sections were cut in the same plane as the MRI slices. There was a good correlation between the extent and severity of the abnormal MRI signal and the pathological changes. Areas of diffuse MRI abnormality corresponded with areas of axonal and myelin loss with gliosis, and small \"lacune\"-like lesions corresponded with lacunar infarcts histologically. Sparing of the subcortical U-fibres was seen histologically and on MRI. The abnormal signal probably originates from increased tissue water attributable to gliosis and an expanded extracellular space.\r"

Serial MR scans of patients with a clinically definite diagnosis were performed on four defined occasions: before an episode, within three days after its onset, after 10 days of therapy as well as four weeks later. Thirteen patients agreed to cooperate in forming a MRI data base and to be rescanned immediately after the onset of an acute relapse. Within one year, six patients had such episodes, one of them had a second bout. Both T1 and T2 relaxation times within the apparently normal white matter were significantly prolonged in all cerebral lobes compared to a control group of healthy volunteers. During the acute attacks as well as during therapy the T1 values remained as before. The T2 values were elevated only in two out of six cases during the episode. After therapy a considerable clinical improvement was seen in all cases, but a significant T2 decrease as a possible effect of cortisone was noted in only one case. We conclude that the prolonged relaxation times T1 and T2 within the apparently normal cerebral white matter of MS patients are the result of a number of molecular events differing considerably among individual patients and that serial measurements of these relaxation times do not consistently change during an acute relapse and do not reflect clinical improvement after high dose prednisolone therapy.\r"

The present study was undertaken to assess the long term effect of such stimulation on the fast hind limb muscles of dystrophic mice. The relationship between the changes induced by stimulation and the initial condition of the dystrophic muscles, as well as other factors which might contribute to this relationship, were examined. The stimulation induced an increase in the force output of weak dystrophic muscles and a speeding of their time course of contraction and relaxation, as well as an increase in their fatigue resistance. In relatively strong dystrophic muscles, the stimulation induced similar changes in contractile speed and fatigue characteristics, but it led to a slight decrease in force output. Our results suggest that the stimulation promotes the growth and differentiation of the small regenerating fibres known to be present in the diseased muscles and, in addition, induces an increase in the mitochondrial content of the muscle fibres. Our results indicate that these effects are not permanent.\r"

The shortest latencies were observed after strong and fast-increase, moving or static stimuli. The responses to weak, gradual stimulation, appeared at a constant delay after the start of the displacement, equal to the minimum latency. An earlier phasic response was observed after fast-increase stimulations in two subjects. The long latency of the responses is probably due to a long central delay, similar to the late flexion reflex following electrical stimulation.\r"

Harding included patients with onset before 25 years. We studied nine patients with FD phenotype but with onset ranging from 21 to 29 years (mean 24.4). Statistical analysis of the distribution and intrafamilial variation of onset age suggests that late onset Friedreich's disease (LOFD) is a distinct genetic entity or results from modifying genes in some families. Scoliosis was less common in LOFD than FD patients but otherwise the clinical picture was similar.\r"

CT scan, performed at the same time, showed evident cerebral angioma in 10 but not in three. A marked hypoperfused area was found in all patients, ranging from -32% to -72% and of the same location as the CT signs. The hypoperfusion seems to result from post ictal phenomenon as well as from chronic ischaemia. SPECT imaging is therefore a sensitive method for visualising intracranial angioma in Sturge-Weber disease and it provides an aid for diagnosis when a CT scan is not reliable.\r"

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, splenocytes and perivascular inflammatory cells in frozen brain sections were examined immunocytochemically for the presence of Ia. Ia expression increased in the spleen, blood and brain during SV encephalitis. The majority of the cells in the central nervous system (CNS) expressing Ia were perivascular mononuclear cells but Ia was also found on stellate parenchymal cells. Using one micrometer cryopreserved serial sections we identified these parenchymal cells as macrophages and microglia but not astrocytes. We also identified rare Ia-positive cells resembling endothelial cells. Frozen brain sections of SV-infected T cell-deficient nu/nu mice were also examined for Ia expression. The number and percentage of Ia-positive cells in perivascular inflammatory cells were markedly decreased compared to normal mice and Ia-positive stellate parenchymal cells were less numerous. This suggests that immunocompetent T cells are necessary for \"normal\" infiltration of inflammatory cells and for Ia expression in the CNS during SV encephalitis.\r"

Infection with HSV-1 did not stimulate synthesis of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or alter the general organization of the intermediate (glial) filaments in astrocyte cultures. However, the dBcAMP-treated astrocytes produced 10- to 100-fold lower titers of cell-free progeny HSV-1 than the untreated astrocyte cultures. Radiolabeled amino acid or glucosamine incorporated into acid precipitable cellular or viral glycoproteins was decreased by 10-25% in dBcAMP-treated astrocytes. Distinctive cell-rounding or syncytial cytopathology was produced by HSV-1 strains infecting untreated astrocytes, but the infected dBcAMP-treated astrocytes displayed only cell-rounding cytopathology. The dBcAMP-related effects on HSV-1 infection were specific to primary astrocyte cultures; they were not observed in HSV-1-infected human fibroblast cultures treated with dBcAMP. Comparison of HSV-1 infection of untreated versus dBcAMP-treated astrocytes suggests that the dBcAMP-induced \"reactive\" or differentiated state of the astrocyte can affect expression of virus-induced cytopathology and virus-specific polypeptide synthesis. The dBcAMP-treated primary astrocyte culture may afford a non-neoplastic, differentiated in vitro system for studying HSV-neural cell interactions.\r"

In beta-protein amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, age-related cerebral amyloidosis, sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy and hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of Dutch origin, antibody to alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) stains senile plaques and vascular deposits. Immature plaques or preamyloid deposits, identified by their positive staining for beta-protein and negative staining for Congo red, which represents the earliest recognizable stages of amyloid deposition, are also labeled. We did not detect ACT in other chemically different forms of cerebral and systemic amyloid. None of the other inhibitors in this study, i.e. antithrombin III and alpha 2-macroglobulin, was detected in the amyloid deposits. Neurons and glial cells throughout the central nervous system in normal and amyloid-containing brains also bind ACT antibody. The results emphasize the close association of ACT with one type of cerebral amyloid (beta-amyloid diseases) as well as the failure to detect such an association in other chemically different forms of cerebral and systemic amyloids.\r"

All gradations from slight to moderate indentation of the cell membranes to complete incorporation of the capillaries in the neuronal perikarya were observed. The penetrating capillaries retained their basement membranes. Because of the chronic inflammation there was extensive fibrous gliosis in Ammon's horn. This apparently had an immobilizing effect on these neurons; it is postulated that proliferating capillaries of the active inflammatory process were unable to displace local neurons and instead grew against and through their perikarya.\r"

DNA indices, cell cycle parameters, and nuclear population densities were compared with patient survival. Selection criteria included the pathologic diagnosis of a cerebral glioblastoma multiforme, absence of therapy before surgery, and adequate tissue to measure each nuclear parameter studied. Nine cases accrued over a two year period. The amount of DNA per nucleus was quantified in fresh tissue specimens by nuclear-isolation flow cytometry in Vindelov's solution. One particular association was significant when tested by Cox models: The percentage of nuclei with S-phase amounts of nuclear DNA was a significant predictor of decreased survival (regression coefficient = 0.20, p = 0.04). The percentage of nuclei in the G0/G1 peak was marginally associated with longer survival. These data are evidence of an association between nuclei in certain phases of the DNA cell cycle and postoperative survival.\r"

Quantitative assessment of immunostaining density was made by histospectrophotometry on frozen sections. Although there was enhanced expression of NGF receptor within endoneurium in all patients with clinical neuropathies, expression was highest in nerves with axonal disease, consistent with the proposal that disruption of axon-Schwann cell interactions triggers the re-expression of the NGF receptor. These results with human nerves, together with previous studies with animal models, suggest that NGF and NGF receptor play important roles in the general response to neuronal injury.\r"

Orbital phlebography was performed in 6 of 12 patients; 3 with normal and 3 with abnormal CT findings. An occlusion of the superior ophthalmic vein was seen in 3 patients with abnormal CT, but not in 3 patients with normal CT. All 12 patients improved with administration of corticosteroids. The results suggest that the intraorbital abnormality revealed by CT may be due to an inflammatory process in the chronic stage and/or the oedematous and infiltrating processes in soft tissues which can be caused by the occlusion of the superior ophthalmic vein or cavernous sinus.\r"

Of the unrelated DMD patients, 63% have deletions for one or more intragenic and/or cDNA probes and 33% have deletions for genomic probes, mostly for pERT 87 (15%) and P 20 (15%). 48% of the DMD patients have deletions for one or more exon regions detected by Cf 56a and Cf 23a. The deletions were mapped. The genomic probe P 20 and the distal part of the cDNA probe Cf 23a detected the same part in the centre of the DMD gene. The deletions are heterogeneous in size and extent. In patients of the same family, identical deletions were detected in the DMD gene. The detection of deletions is useful for prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection.\r"

Long-term outcome seems to show a closer link to white matter changes, which are at present best investigated by magnetic resonance imaging.

We also attempted to have patients complete a questionnaire regarding any possible neurological problems. This was done in 14 patients. Metastasis to the CNS occurred significantly less often in patients who received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in a dose of 20 Gy in five equal fractions (two of 48), compared with patients who did not receive it (four of 10) (P less than .006). Delayed neurological complications occurred in nine of 48 (19%) patients who received PCI. However, in only two patients did PCI appear to be responsible for progressive dementia. In the other seven patients (one with weakness in the arms and legs, one with transient left hemiparesis, two with hearing loss, and three with various visual disturbances), chemotherapeutic agents (mainly cisplatin and vincristine) and underlying diseases probably contributed significantly to the occurrence of these complications. In addition, these neurological disturbances were transient or ran a stable course and did not adversely affect the daily life of these patients. In comparison, amongst the 10 patients who did not receive PCI one had progressive dementia and another had hemiparesis secondary to probable brain embolism. We conclude that the use of PCI in these doses was effective in reducing the frequency of CNS metastases and had an adverse effect on the daily life and well-being only in a minority of the patients. Until results of controlled randomized studies show otherwise, PCI should continue to be used as a part of the combined modality treatment of completely responding patients with limited SCLC.\r"

Patients whose condition deteriorated underwent an OLB on day 4. Eight of 12 patients (67%) having OLB survived versus 10 of 12 (83%) receiving ET (P = .64). Morbidity occurred in nine of 12 (75%) having OLB versus eight of 12 (67%) receiving ET (P = 1.0). Concurrently, there were 14 additional cancer patients with DIP who were not randomized (nine refused, three had a coagulopathy contraindicating surgery, two were excluded by primary care physicians) and who were comparable demographically to the randomized group. Two received OLB and 12 ET. Combining the randomized and nonrandomized groups, eight of 14 (57%) having an initial OLB survived versus 18 of 24 (75%) of ET-treated patients (P2 = .19). Results of the OLB were seven Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), five nonspecific pneumonitis (NSP), one cytomegalovirus, and one lymphoma. Results of OLB led to discontinuation of antibiotics in three patients. Of the 24 ET patients, eight failed to improve by day 4 and had an OLB. Results were two NSP, two PCP, two cancer, one blastomycosis, and one Candida pneumonia. Complications were seen in 10 of 14 (72%) initial OLB patients versus 14 of 24 (58%) patients on the ET arm (P = .65). When the complication rate between patients receiving only empiric antibiotics was compared with all patients having an OLB (initially or on day 4), the difference was greater in patients undergoing OLB (37% v 72%, respectively) (P2 = .14). ET with TMP-SMX plus erythromycin and broad spectrum antibiotics in granulocytopenic patients appeared to be as successful and potentially less toxic than an OLB in this study. Although the number of patients in this study was small, these data suggest that a trial of empiric antibiotic management may be reasonable in cancer patients presenting with DIP, especially if they are nonneutropenic.\r"

  ".W": "Both cisplatin and leucovorin (LV) interact with fluorouracil (5-FU) by increasing intracellular reduced folate levels and thereby the inhibition of thymidylate synthase. Therefore, the addition of LV to cisplatin and 5-FU (PFL) may increase the activity of that combination in head and neck cancer. We treated 31 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer with two cycles of neoadjuvant PFL consisting of 100 mg/m2 of cisplatin on day 1 followed by a 5-day continuous infusion of 5-FU at 1,000 mg/m2/day and oral LV at 100 mg administered every 4 hours during the entire duration of chemotherapy infusion. Two patients died during neoadjuvant chemotherapy of sudden death and sepsis, respectively, and were not evaluated for response. Of 29 evaluable patients, nine had a complete response (CR), 17 had a partial response (PR), and three had stable disease. Toxicities consisted of mild to moderate myelosuppression and moderate to severe mucositis, necessitating reduction of 5-FU on cycle 2 to less than or equal to 80% of the intended dose in 22 of 29 patients. Administration of LV by repeated oral dosing resulted in total reduced folate plasma concentrations of 5.3 (+/- 2.9) and 6.7 (+/- 3.4) mumol on days 2 and 4 of the 5-FU infusion. The sum of 1-LV and its metabolite 5-CH3-tetrahydrofolate exceeded the concentration of d-LV, consistent with selective absorption of the biologically active 1-stereoisomer from the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-seven previously untreated patients with intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were treated with four courses of a regimen that consisted of high-dose (120 mg/m2) Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), vincristine (2 mg), cytarabine (3 gm/m2), and dexamethasone (50 mg intravenously [IV] on day 1 and 20 mg/day orally on days 2 to 5) (AVAD), which was administered every 3 to 4 weeks. The median age of the patients was 58 years; 72% were Ann Arbor stage IV, 49% had \"B\" symptoms, 62% had masses larger than 7 cm, 40% had masses at least 10 cm in diameter, and 49% had serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) greater than 250 U/L. Overall, 72% of the patients (89% of diffuse large-cell lymphoma [DLCL] patients) attained complete (CR) or probable complete responses (PCR), and relapses occurred in 32%. There were no episodes of clinical congestive heart failure, but one patient developed recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. Fever during neutropenia occurred with 65% of treatment courses. Three deaths were attributed primarily to complications of therapy. The lymphoma-free survival of all entered patients is 51% (24 of 47), with a follow-up of 30 to 67 months (median, 58 months). These results confirm that high CR/PCR and long-term survival rates can be achieved in patients with aggressive histologies of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, even in groups with poor prognostic factors, using high-dose anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens delivered over a short period of time. However, the apparently higher relapse rate in comparison to our previous study leads us to speculate that consolidation with noncross-resistant agents may be helpful in increasing even further the cure rate in this group of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Staging laparotomy was performed as part of the routine recommended diagnostic evaluation following clinical staging (CS) in 692 patients presenting with supradiaphragmatic Hodgkin's disease (HD). Various clinical factors were analyzed by multivariate analysis for prediction of abdominal involvement. Factors that were statistically significant for predicting disease below the diaphragm included CS III-IV disease (P less than .001), B symptoms (P less than .001), mixed cellularity (MC) or lymphocytic depletion (LD) histology (P = .017), number of supradiaphragmatic sites greater than or equal to 2 (P = .001), male sex (P = 0.034) and age greater than or equal to 40 years (P = .004). Separate analyses were performed for various subgroups of CS IA-IIA, CS IB-IIB, CS IIIA-IVA, and CS IIIB-IVB patients. Upstaging was seen in 0% to 55% of CS I-II patients based on subgroup. Male sex, B symptoms, and number of sites above the diaphragm greater than or equal to 2 all independently predicted for positive surgical staging in CS I-II patients. Sixty-four percent of CS I-II patients who were upstaged had extensive abdominal disease by positive lower abdominal nodes or multiple splenic nodules (greater than or equal to 5). Downstaging (to pathological stage [PS] I-II) was seen in 9% to 68% of patients with CS III-IV disease based on subgrouping. Age greater than or equal to 40, MC or LD histology, and B symptoms all independently predicted for positive surgical staging in CS III-IV patients. Downstaging was more frequently seen in CS IIIA-IVA patients (55%) than in patients who were CS III-IVB (22%). Four subgroups of patients who had a low probability (less than 10%) of stage or treatment change following laparotomy were identified. These included CS IA female patients, CS IA male patients with lymphocyte predominance histology or high neck presentations, and patients with CS IIIB-IVB disease and account for 21% of the study population. Staging laparotomy altered the stage and treatment of a significant number of the remaining 79% patients and should continue to be recommended for this group of patients.\r"

In 20 patients, the diagnosis was established by endoscopic biopsy only; the other 14 had laparotomy and biopsy. No patient had a gastrectomy before treatment. Nineteen patients had stage IE disease and 15 had stage IIE. Lymphoma diagnoses were: diffuse large-cell, 26; immunoblastic, three; diffuse well-differentiated, three; nodular mixed, one; and unclassified, one. The treatment plan was to deliver an initial four cycles of chemotherapy, followed by radiotherapy, and finally, more chemotherapy. Thirty-three patients received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (CHOP-Bleo). Four patients with stage IIE disease received cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, etoposide, and dexamethasone (CMED). Twenty-three patients (68%) never had a relapse. Three patients had successful salvage therapy, one for local recurrence and two for tumor dissemination. Five patients died of recurrent abdominal disease, and one died of tumor dissemination. Two died of treatment-related complications, one of sepsis during treatment with CMED and one of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. No patient developed stomach perforation or bleeding as a result of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Twenty-four of the 26 surviving patients were able to retain their stomachs. One patient required a gastrectomy for progressive disease during chemotherapy, and another required a subtotal gastrectomy for relief of an obstruction caused by cicatrization. These data show that surgery is not a necessary procedure in gastric lymphoma. Favorable results can be achieved by combining effective chemotherapy and local radiation.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a randomized multicenter trial comparing low-dose cytarabine (LD ARA-C) (20 mg/m2 for 21 days) with an intensive chemotherapy (rubidazone [a daunorubicin-derived agent], 100 mg/m2 for 4 days, ARA-C 200 mg/m2 for 7 days) in 87 patients over 65 years of age with de novo acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Forty-one patients received LD ARA-C and 46 received intensive chemotherapy. The number of complete remissions (CRs) but also of early deaths was higher in the intensive chemotherapy group, while partial remissions (PRs) and failures were more frequent in the LD ARA-C group (P less than .001). Infectious complications during induction treatment were more numerous and more severe in the intensive chemotherapy group (P less than .01). Patients treated with LD ARA-C required fewer RBC transfusions (P less than .02), fewer platelet transfusions (P less than .01), and had a shorter hospital stay for induction treatment (P less than .01). Overall survival and CR duration were not significantly different in either group. In the LD ARA-C group, the survival of patients with PR and those of patients in CRs was identical. We conclude that in a selected group of elderly patients with de novo ANLL a higher number of CRs may be obtained with intensive chemotherapy, but that with LD ARA-C, the number of early deaths is lower, and long-lasting PRs are obtained, resulting in a similar overall survival.\r"

  ".U": "90132835\r", 
  ".W": "We evaluated the courses of 115 consecutive cases of pediatric acute leukemia treated with induction chemotherapy. Seventy-two patients developed fever associated with neutropenia; 15 developed systemic fungal infections. We reviewed multiple demographic and treatment characteristics of these patients in an attempt to identify potential risk factors for the development of invasive fungal disease (IFD). Risk factors identified in a univariate analysis included duration of neutropenia after first fever (P less than .0001), diagnosis of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) (P = .003), onset of fever and neutropenia within 5 days of starting induction chemotherapy (P = .009), and multiple (greater than one) surveillance culture sites positive for fungal organisms (P = .02). In a multiple logistic regression analysis, duration of neutropenia (P less than .001) remained a significant risk factor. The study group of patients had a significantly higher risk of fungal infections than a matched group of leukemia patients developing fever with neutropenia due to postremission consolidation chemotherapy (P = .003). In the first 48 patients, 14 (29%) developed IFD. In the subsequent patients (n = 24), intravenous miconazole (5 mg/kg every 8 hours) was begun at the time of the first fever. One of the 24 patients (4%) given miconazole developed IFD. The use of miconazole was a negative risk factor for the development of IFD in univariate (P = .01) and multivariate (P = .05) analysis. We conclude that pediatric leukemia patients who develop fever associated with neutropenia during induction chemotherapy are at high risk for developing IFD. The role of intravenous miconazole at the time of the first fever in this group deserves further study.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-seven consecutive children and young adults with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) were treated uniformly with induction chemotherapy based on daunorubicin and cytarabine (ara-C), with the addition of etoposide (VP-16) and azacytidine (5-Az) for refractory patients. Of the 65 patients who entered complete remission, 42 were eligible for assessment of response to intensive chemotherapy consisting of four pairs of drugs administered in sequential fashion. Nineteen others with available histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA)-compatible donors were assigned to receive allogeneic bone marrow transplants within 16 weeks from their dates of complete remission. Durations of continuous complete remission (CCR) in the two groups were not significantly different at a median follow-up time of 6 years (P = .30 by log-rank analysis). Kaplan-Meier estimates of CCR probabilities (+/- SE) at 6 years were 43% +/- 13% (transplantation) and 31% +/- 7% (sequential chemotherapy). Postremission failures in the sequential chemotherapy group resulted from bone marrow relapse in 23 of 29 patients (79%), whereas in the transplantation group, failures were equally divided between marrow relapse and transplantation-related complications of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or infection due to the immunosuppressive effects of ablative chemotherapy. Comparison of hematologic remission curves indicated a significant advantage for marrow transplantation in terms of systemic leukemia control (P = .06). Thus, in programs of intensive chemotherapy of the type described here, allogeneic marrow transplantation should be seriously considered as alternative therapy for patients in first remission who have an HLA-matched sibling donor, provided that effective methods for control of transplant-related complications are available.\r"

The model is based on radiation dose in Gray adjusted for location of therapy and attained stature (GALA); ideal adult stature (IAS), assuming the patient had not developed cancer, calculated by the Roche-Wainer-Thissen (RWT) method (which uses patient stature and weight before developing cancer, and parent stature data); a femur correction if both the acetabula or heads of both femurs were irradiated (FEMUR); and sex. The model was constructed using data from 49 patients with a mean time from completion of therapy to follow-up of 8.9 years (range, 3.3 to 15.4 years). Thirteen patients received no radiotherapy. All model coefficients were highly significant (P less than .001), and the model appears to be an excellent predictor of adult stature, with a multiple correlation coefficient of 0.84 (R2 = .74) between corrected adult stature (CAS) based on the most recent follow-up stature available for the patient projected to final adult stature, compared with the model's predicted adult stature (MPAS), based only on initial data at presentation and subsequent radiation treatment. Patients who did not receive radiotherapy did not have loss of stature, ie, there was no significant difference between IAS and CAS, (P less than .71; n = 13), but patients who received radiotherapy had shorter statures than would be expected from the healthy population model (P less than .0004; n = 36). The magnitude of the loss in stature appears to be well explained by the dose and location of radiation, the stature already achieved at the time of radiotherapy, along with IAS, FEMUR, and sex. We believe this model will help clinicians to predict the growth effects of radiotherapy in children with cancer not involving the CNS.\r"

Three patients (6%; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 2% to 17%) achieved a partial response, one of those after dose escalation. In addition, one patient had a minor response, then progressing disease, and again had a minor response after dose escalation. All four responders had nonassessable primary tumors (three had had prior nephrectomy and one a renal angioinfarction). The only major toxicity was renal (37 patients had minor to moderate elevations in serum creatinine level). Immunologic studies (hypersensitivity skin testing, lymphocyte blastogenesis response, number of lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, T helper and T suppressor subsets, and T helper: suppressor ratio), performed before and after therapy, showed a relative lymphopenia and decreased hypersensitivity skin-testing results at baseline, and a general decline over time in the number of T cells and T helper and T suppressor subsets. There was no enhancement in any of the immunologic parameters tested. The response rate was 6%, lower than previously reported; a general immunodeficiency was noted at baseline, and the lymphopenia worsened with progressing disease, unaffected by therapy.\r"

We conducted a phase I/II trial of the 5-HT3 antagonist BRL43694 (granisetron) in 24 chemotherapy-naive patients who were receiving any combination of doxorubicin and/or cisplatin. The first 12 patients received 40 micrograms/kg and the second 12 received 80 micrograms/kg of granisetron intravenously before beginning chemotherapy. Nausea was assessed by a patient-completed visual analogue scale and episodes of retching recorded by the patient and an independent observer. Fifty-two percent of the 22 evaluable patients had no retching or vomiting and 32% had no nausea during the first 24 hours after chemotherapy. Pharmacokinetic measurements were performed. The disposition of granisetron was best described using a two-compartment model. The area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) was 277 +/- 226 ng.h/mL and 359 +/- 282 ng.h/mL at 40 and 80 micrograms/kg, respectively. The total body clearance was 0.319 +/- 0.315 L/kg/hr and 0.483 +/- 0.504 L/kg/hr at the 40 and 80 micrograms/kg doses. Wide interpatient variation in model independent parameters was observed. There was no suggestion of dose-dependent efficacy at the two dose levels studied. We conclude that granisetron shows promise as a well-tolerated and effective antiemetic. Randomized trials comparing this drug with standard regimens are currently underway.\r"

  ".W": "In a retrospective study of 153 testis cancer survivors, we examined the sociodemographic and clinical determinants of attitudes and behaviors toward illness-induced infertility. Five fertility adjustment responses were identified: sperm-banking awareness (SBA); adoption awareness (AA); fertility testing (FT); trying to father children (TFC); and fertility distress (FD). Although responses to infertility are multidetermined, these data demonstrate there is a distinct sociodemographic and clinical profile for the subgroups of men who engage in different fertility-related behaviors. Multivariate analysis results show that men most likely to be concerned with banking sperm are those who at diagnosis are younger (less than 35 years), childless, college educated, and whose relationships have become strained. Men who sought fertility tests were childless, college graduates, and able to ejaculate. The only factor predicting adoption was childlessness. Those married men attempting to father children were also less than 35 years of age at diagnosis and without ejaculatory dysfunction. The men at greatest risk for continued distress about infertility were those who remained childless and had posttreatment ejaculatory dysfunction. Residual infertility distress also was significantly associated with treatments that included extensive retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) surgery, indicating that the latter is a \"risk factor\" in survivors' long-term distress. These data, while not definitive, show that the prerogative to have children is very important to men and that losing it sets into motion a range of both adverse emotions and adaptive responses. Adjustment to infertility is a complex process that begins at diagnosis and extends long after treatment is completed.\r"

On univariate analyses using the log-rank test, five variables were found to be significantly related to survival. These included compliance with allopurinol (probably acting as a surrogate for self-medication with other chemotherapeutic agents) (P = .007), control versus educational program cohort (P less than .001), disease severity (P = .009), Karnofsky at diagnosis (P = .011), sex (P = .084), and clinic appointments kept (P = .043). In hierarchical proportional hazards models, the following variables were associated with decreased risk of death: disease severity (P less than .025), keeping over 60% of appointments (P less than .05), allopurinol/oxipurinol compliance (P less than .01), and educational program cohort (P less than .05). After controlling for all other variables, three variables were associated with increased survival: high disease severity (relative risk [RR] = 2.48), high compliance with allopurinol (RR = .45), and educational program cohort (RR = .39). We conclude that compliance with oral medication has a significant effect on patient survival. In addition, the use of special educational and supportive programs designed to improve patient compliance are associated with significant prolongation of patient survival due to, as well as independent of their effects on compliance.\r"

For government to act in any area involving nutrient fortification of foods requires an acceptable database demonstrating a health hazard. The requirements of current law demand that new formulas be investigated by appropriate clinical studies but do not grant the FDA clear authority to establish maximum limits for nutrients in infant formulas. Except when an unquestionable hazard can be demonstrated, there are important barriers to governmental action in this area. Without a clearly defined, scientifically acceptable database, without consensus in the scientific and professional community, and without public support for action to be taken in this area, the establishment of maximum limits for many nutrients will be extremely difficult.\r"

  ".W": "Current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved levels of adequacy and of upper limits in infant formulas for vitamin A are 250 and 750 IU per 100 kcal, respectively. The level of adequacy is generous relative to need. Because vitamin A toxicity has been noted in infants at intakes of 2,100 IU per 100 kcal, an upper limit might well be selected in the range of 750-1,000 IU per 100 kcal for healthy infants. Some children and adults, however, are intolerant of relatively low intakes. The current FDA-approved adequacy level for vitamin K is 4 micrograms per 100 kcal, which also is generous relative to need. An upper limit has not previously been set. Neither single intramuscular doses of phylloquinone that are 100 times the RDA (RDI) for infants nor diets that contain 10-20 times the RDA (RDI) for adults show any adverse effects. Some allergic reactions to injected vitamin K have been reported, however, and menadione, even in low doses, shows significant toxicity in neonates. Thus, although toxicity to phylloquinone is unlikely, it has been suggested that the upper limit of phylloquinone in infant formulas be set at 20 micrograms per 100 kcal, primarily to discourage nutritionally unwarranted supplementation.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Seven general practices in the lower Hunter Region of Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Of 693 men and women 25 to 65 years old attending the general practices, 616 (89%) participated. Twelve pregnant women and four without blood samples were excluded, leaving 600 subjects (208 men, 392 women). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-two percent of subjects had blood cholesterol higher than 6.5 mmol/L (250 mg/dl). In women, high cholesterol was mainly found among those over 40 years of age, but in men high cholesterol was more evenly spread across the different age groups. Stepwise logistic regression identified age, history of hypertension, and a past history of heart attack as significant independent predictors of high cholesterol. A simple model developed from these variables identified 81% of men and women (95% CI = 72-90%) with high cholesterol while testing only 49% of the population (95% CI = 44-54%). This model was developed in a random subset of 331 of the 600 subjects, and when applied to the remaining 269 subjects, it identified 77% of those with high cholesterol (95% CI = 67-87%) after testing 48% (95% CI = 42-54%). CONCLUSIONS: Selective screening using this simple model can identify adults who are likely to have high blood cholesterol and could complement case-finding or provide an alternative high-risk strategy for communities that cannot afford to screen all individuals.\r"

The questionnaire was administered to three independent samples of adult primary care patients. Patients' satisfaction and their attitudes regarding their illnesses are evaluated after their medical visits. This instrument is designed to examine three relatively distinct factors: 1) doctor facilitation of patient involvement, 2) level of information exchange, and 3) patient participation in decision making. Of these factors, doctor facilitation and patient decision making were related significantly to patients' satisfaction with care. Doctor facilitation and information exchange related consistently to patients' perceptions of post-visit changes in their understanding, reassurance, perceived control over illness, and expectations for improvement in functioning. The role of physicians in enhancing patient involvement in care and the potential therapeutic benefits of physician facilitative behavior are addressed.\r"

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Survey questionnaires were sent to residency directors at all 434 internal medicine residency programs accredited in 1985-1986. Response rate for two mailings was 71%. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 78% OF RESIDENCY DIRECTORS and 70% of department chairpersons had high or moderately high levels of commitment to teaching humanistic/psychosocial aspects of care, but only 44% of responding programs offered mandatory training, and only 18% offered elective training in these areas. Obstacles to expanded teaching of the humanistic/psychosocial aspects rated high or moderately high by residency directors included insufficient curriculum time (51%), lack of trained faculty (44%), and pressures to reduce both training costs (40%) and patient-care costs (37%). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the training that does occur in the humanistic/psychosocial aspects of care probably happens informally via mentoring and role modeling. Appeals to expand teaching in these areas raise questions regarding what to include in medical training and the proper scope of internal medicine. Sustainable change will depend on the politics of resource distribution and the influence of general internal medicine and primary care on traditional training.\r"

Thirteen videotaped PGY-1 encounters constituted the preintervention group and 16 videotaped PGY-1 encounters constituted the postintervention group. The preintervention group performed a mean of 1.38 skills while the postintervention group performed a mean of 3.56 skills, a statistically significant improvement (p less than 0.05). The authors conclude that an educational approach that focuses on specific elements of interactions facilitates the incorporation of skills associated with humane medical care.\r"

Although the pattern of skeletal and dental changes during the first postsurgical year were quite different for the groups, stability, incisal opening, and clinical results were equivalent at 1 year following surgery. In the first 6 weeks postsurgery, the screw fixation group was more stable horizontally and vertically than the wire group, but between 6 weeks and 1 year, the wire group showed recovery, and the mean differences all but disappeared.\r"

The surgical groups studied were Le Fort I osteotomy (LEFORT; n = 13), sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO; n = 6), intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy (IVRO; n = 9), and isolated genioplasty (GENIO; n = 5). Neurosensory function was assessed by three different testing modalities which included static light touch (SLT), moving touch discrimination (MTD), and two-point discrimination (TPD). Cutaneous sensation of the lower lip and chin were examined for the mandibular procedures, whereas the infraorbital and upper lip regions were evaluated following maxillary surgery. Immediately following surgery, each group varied in both the incidence and magnitude of neurosensory deficits (NSD). The SSRO group had the highest percentage of sites with immediate postsurgical NSD to both SLT (72%) and MTD (67%), followed by the LEFORT (SLT = 50%, MDT = 58%), GENIO (SLT = 27%, MTD = 6%), and IVRO groups (SLT = 11%, MTD = 18%), respectively. Each group also varied in the severity of the initial postoperative deficit as measured by SLT, with the SSRO group showing the greatest deficit followed by the LEFORT, GENIO, and IVRO groups. During the 6-month recovery period each group approached preoperative levels of sensation at a different rate. The LEFORT group recovered most rapidly, with few anatomic sites showing NSD (SLT = 20%, MTD = 5%) at the 1-month postoperative examination, and the majority of the group (96%) returned to preoperative sensation by 3 months following surgery. The SSRO group recovered more slowly, with approximately half of the group demonstrating a deficit (SLT = 50%, MTD = 59%) at 1 month, which diminished to about one fourth of the sites (SLT = 25%, MTD = 5%) by 3 months. Most of the SSRO group (90%) exhibited no residual deficit 6 months following surgery. The IVRO group had few sites with immediate NSD (SLT = 11%, MTD = 15%). In none of the surgical groups was a statistically significant correlation found between the severity of the initial NSD and length of time to complete recovery.\r"

Data on the donors were also reviewed to define the characteristics of a successful cardiac donor. Patients had transplants between November 1985 and November 1988. Several primary cardiac diagnoses were indications for transplantation, including congestive cardiomyopathy, hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, and other types of native and postoperative complex congenital heart diseases. The ages ranged from birth to 7 months. Of 25 patients, 21 are still alive (84% survival rate) with follow-up from 4 to 40 months. No late deaths have occurred. Long-term immunosuppression was accomplished with cyclosporine and azathioprine. Rejection surveillance was performed noninvasively; only one child required an endomyocardial biopsy. Donors died from a variety of traumatic and metabolic causes, including sudden infant death syndrome. The majority (72%) of donors had a history of cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. One third were receiving inotropic support at the time of cardiac evaluation. We conclude that orthotopic cardiac transplantation is an effective therapy for infants with lethal heart disease. A larger donor pool is required, and many dying infants, despite cardiac arrest and resuscitation, would be suitable donors.\r"

Six patients had coronary atherosclerosis, and five of these patients died 6 months to 3 years after heart transplantation. The late deaths were sudden and unexpected. Coronary angiography demonstrated several types of lesions, including concentric narrowing, tubular segmental lesions, and abrupt obliteration of major coronary vessels. Risk factors assessed included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cytomegalovirus infection, type of immunosuppressive regimen, number of rejection episodes, and major histocompatibility antigen mismatches. Only the frequency and duration of rejection episodes seemed to be more prevalent in the patients in whom coronary atherosclerosis developed. Despite the benefits of heart transplantation in treating children with end-stage heart disease, coronary atherosclerosis may limit long-term survival. We suggest that these children should undergo serial coronary angiography to identify those at risk for subsequent events related to coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "To examine whether the live varicella vaccine virus is attenuated, we analyzed varicella vaccine-induced contact cases of clinical chickenpox in healthy siblings of immunized children with leukemia. A rash developed approximately 1 month later in 156 children with leukemia who had been vaccinated. Vaccine-type virus was isolated from 25 of these children. Of 88 known susceptible healthy siblings who were exposed to a vaccine with a rash and from whom follow-up information was available, there was evidence of infection in 15 (17%). Of 15 siblings with seroconversion, 11 (73%) also acquired a mild rash with an average of 38 lesions and no accompanying systemic symptoms. Vaccine-type virus was isolated from four of the contact siblings. Tertiary transmission was documented once. Contact siblings with seroconversion were protected during future household exposure to chickenpox, which occurred in four instances. There was a direct relationship between transmission from vaccinees to varicella-susceptible close contacts and the presence and number of skin lesions in children with leukemia after vaccination. We conclude that in the transmission of varicella, the virus probably originates from skin lesions of infected persons and reaches the respiratory tract of those with secondary cases by the airborne route. On the basis of the mildness of the contact illness, the higher-than-normal rate of subclinical primary infection with varicella-zoster virus in contacts, and the lower-than-normal rate of spread of the vaccine virus to susceptible children in the household, we further conclude that the vaccine virus is attenuated. There was no evidence of reversion of the vaccine virus to virulence.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to examine whether there is a correlation between parental information on the child's history of whooping cough and the presence or absence of serum antibodies against two antigens of Bordetella pertussis, pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin, in nonvaccinated Swedish children. The parents of 266 Swedish children aged 1 to 4 years answered a questionnaire regarding the child's history of whooping cough, and a serum sample was obtained from the child for determination of IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin. The study was performed from 1984 to 1986, five to seven years after the cessation of general vaccination against pertussis in Sweden; none of the children had received pertussis vaccine. Antibodies to both toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin increased with age. Of the children aged 4 years, 50% had antibodies to both antigens. Of all 266 children, 100 had antibodies to both antigens, 6 to toxin alone, and 49 to filamentous hemagglutinin alone. There was a good correlation between the presence of antibodies and a history of whooping cough. Of 91 children with a history of whooping cough, 77 had antibodies against both antigens and 13 against one antigen; only one child lacked detectable antibodies against both antigens. Of the 175 children with no history of whooping cough, 110 lacked detectable antibodies to both antigens, 23 had antibodies to both, 2 to toxin alone, and 40 to filamentous hemagglutinin alone. The data indicate that parental information on a previous history of whooping cough in their nonimmunized child is reliable, and that many infections with B. pertussis are subclinical or atypical. Exposure to other Bordetella species than B. pertussis, which is the only toxin-producing species, might be important for the development of FHA antibodies. A follow-up 2 to 4 years after the collection of serum samples of children without a history of whooping cough but with antibodies to one or both antigens indicated that serum antibodies to toxin, but not to filamentous hemagglutinin, may be protective against disease.\r"

Three adenoviruses, one parainfluenza virus type 2 and one type 3, one respiratory syncytial virus, one echovirus type 11, one herpes simplex virus type 2, and one influenza B virus were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. A simple febrile convulsion occurred in seven children with a positive cerebrospinal fluid viral isolation, and two had a complex febrile seizure. In a follow-up of 2 to 4 years (mean 3.3 years), 21 of the 107 children with simple seizures (19.6%) and 3 of the 32 children with complicated seizures (9.4%) had recurrent febrile seizures. The children with positive evidence for a viral infection, even with a virus isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid, had no more recurrences than those without any proven viral infection. We conclude that children with a proven viral infection have no worse prognosis than those without.\r"

The study included detailed, open-ended, structured interviews and observational accounts of the subjects before, during, and after camp. These interviews and observations in a sample of 50 children revealed that the children engaged in informal discussion about cancer and its treatment, and that information on a variety of topics, ranging from medical procedures to prognosis, was exchanged. Despite the lack of formal instruction, there was a significant increase in the children's knowledge about cancer and its treatment. Age, sex, diagnosis, years since diagnosis, treatment status and times at camp were not found to be significant determinants of gain in knowledge. No control group was studied, but we believe that the data support the conclusion that attending a camp for children with cancer improves their knowledge of the disease and its treatment.\r"

Eighty-six percent of patients learned normal defecation dynamics with up to six biofeedback sessions. At 7 months, 13% of conventionally treated and 77% of biofeedback-treated patients had normal defecation dynamics (p less than 0.01); one conventionally treated (5%) and 12 biofeedback-treated patients (55%) had recovered (p less than 0.01). Learning normal defecation dynamics was correlated with clinical recovery (p less than 0.01). At 7 months, 11% of patients with normal defecation dynamics after biofeedback treatment had abnormal defecation dynamics, and 71% of the biofeedback-treated patients with normal defecation dynamics recovered. At 12 months, 16% of conventionally treated and 50% of biofeedback-treated patients had recovered (p less than 0.05). Balloon defecation did not improve significantly in those who learned normal defecation dynamics. Therefore the ability to defecate balloons is apparently not dependent on the normal function of the external and sphincter and pelvic floor muscles alone. Biofeedback treatment is complementary to a good conventional therapeutic regimen in patients with abnormal defecation dynamics.\r"

Resources measured included length of stay and number and cost of laboratory and imaging studies. Pediatric intensive care unit and daily mortality risks (assessed by the Physiologic Stability Index and the Dynamic Risk Index) were stratified as very low risk (less than 1%), low risk (1% to 2.5%), moderate risk (2.5% to 5.0%), and high risk (greater than 5%). Increasing daily resource use was directly related to increasing gradations of severity of illness. For very low, low-, moderate-, and high-risk patient days, the daily numbers of diagnostic studies were (mean +/- SEM) 20.1 +/- 0.6, 31.4 +/- 1.1, 37.7 +/- 1.6, and 43.0 +/- 1.8, respectively. Total resource use, including diagnostic tests and length of stay, also increased with pediatric intensive care unit mortality risk. Diagnostic testing and corresponding costs were significantly higher for infants who died in the pediatric intensive care unit than for survivors on a day-by-day basis as well as for the entire stay in the care unit. We conclude that there is a direct, positive relationship between resource use, cost, and gradations of severity of illness that, if accounted for, would result in more equitable health care reimbursement.\r"

The three living infants had neonatal cholestasis as a major component of their clinical findings. Pathologic changes included giant cell transformation, ductal obstruction, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Liver involvement has been noted incidentally in children with neonatal lupus erythematosus, but it has generally been attributed to hemodynamic compromise as a result of congenital heart block or systemic toxic reactions. We speculate that neonatal hepatitis proceeding to hepatic fibrosis may occur in neonatal lupus erythematosus, analogous to the occurrence of \"idiopathic\" congenital heart block. The neonatal hepatitis associated with neonatal lupus erythematosus is a form distinguishable from the \"idiopathic\" group. Liver involvement may be more common than was previously recognized, and prospective studies to look for maternal autoantibodies in idiopathic neonatal liver disease should be undertaken.\r"

  ".U": "90133220\r", 
  ".W": "We examined the relative feasibility of using random urinary dipstick testing and urinary protein/creatinine ratios in the quantitation of proteinuria. Sixty-four children with relapsing nephrotic syndrome, ranging in age from 1 1/2 to 16 years, contributed 145 timed urine collections and 150 random specimens, which were analyzed by urinary protein dipstick, quantitation of protein and creatinine, or both. Total protein excretion was expressed as grams per surface area per day and the urinary protein/creatinine ratio as milligrams of protein per milligram of creatinine. Degrees of proteinuria were designated as physiologic (less than 0.1 gm/m2/day), intermediate (greater than 0.1 and less than 1.0 gm/m2/day), or nephrotic (greater than 1.0 gm/m2/day). The log regression analysis of the 24-hour urinary protein/creatinine ratio (y) and total protein excretion (x) was highly significant (r = 0.97; p less than 0.001). The upper and lower confidence limits of the urinary protein/creatinine ratio (1.0 and 0.1, respectively) closely approximated the designations for nephrotic and physiologic proteinuria, respectively. These values were therefore used to classify degrees of proteinuria by the urine protein/creatinine ratio. The validity of these tests was assessed by sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value, and compared with that of random testing by urinary dipstick. The urinary protein/creatinine ratio offered good reliability as a test for classifying degrees of proteinuria and accurately predicting nephrotic and physiologic proteinuria. The random dipstick testing was reliable only when results were distinctly positive and when sensitivity and specificity were low. The error in the total protein excretion value that was imposed by collection errors with high and low variations in the creatinine value (57% of samples) was largely corrected by normalization of the data by log transformation. When controlled for creatinine excretion, linear regression analysis allowed calculation of total protein excretion (TP) from the urinary protein/creatinine ratio (U P/Cr) by the following equation: TP (gm/m2/day) = 0.63 (U P/Cr) at all levels of proteinuria. The random urinary protein/creatinine ratio appeared to offer the most sensitive test for classification of proteinuria in children with nephrosis, with the advantages of ease and expediency not afforded by the 24-hour urine quantitation.\r"

All subjects had normal lung volumes, expiratory flow rates, and diffusing capacity except for two siblings with mild asthma whose values reverted to the normal range after administration of an inhaled bronchodilator. Liver function was normal in all subjects with the exception of one boy who had an isolated elevation of alkaline phosphatase activity. Smoking attitudes, as determined by questionnaire, did not differ from those of 130 control subjects, but smoking initiation rates were significantly lower (p = 0.02). We believe that the issue of neonatal screening for alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency should be reexamined because augmentation therapy for adults with emphysema is now available, and screening followed by family-based smoking intervention may lead to a nonsmoking life-style. The latter is especially important because the current weight of epidemiologic evidence strongly suggests that in nonsmokers with this condition, severe emphysema may never develop or, if it does, it will do so at a much later age than in smokers.\r"

Furthermore, an inverse relationship between total serum calcium and circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels was evident during treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. We examined this relationship with a 33-hour intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate in the absence of exogenous 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 therapy. The infusion was accompanied by a gradual increase of both total serum calcium and blood ionized calcium concentrations from hypocalcemic to normocalcemic ranges, and produced a 50% reduction in circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D values, with minimal changes in circulating phosphorus, magnesium, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D values. These results suggest that calcium-dependent, parathyroid hormone-independent regulation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production may exist in human beings.\r"

A group of 18 children (18%) with cardiac anomalies had an increased mortality rate in comparison with those children without cardiac defects (72% vs 38%). The frequency and severity of nonpulmonary abnormalities in children with congenital diaphragmatic defects suggest that examination of affected children should include cardiac evaluation, a karyotype when the defect is one feature of a broader pattern of altered development, and a careful evaluation for minor anomalies, which may provide clues to an overall diagnosis.\r"

The patient's mononuclear cells had defective class I (HLA-A, -B, -C) and absent class II (HLA-D) antigen expression on their surface, thus establishing the diagnosis of HLA-deficient severe combined immune deficiency (bare lymphocyte syndrome). Family HLA typing, in vitro stimulation of patient mononuclear cells, and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization allowed the patients HLA phenotype to be determined. An unrelated bone marrow donor whose phenotype matched at all but a single A locus was found. The patient was conditioned with busulfan and cyclophosphamide, followed by infusion of T-cell-depleted bone marrow cells. The patient has been infection free with a successful marrow graft documented by HLA typing and chromosomal analysis. Sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization allows determination of the HLA phenotype in patients with HLA-deficient severe combined immune deficiency which, in turn, makes marrow transplantation an option for the reconstitution of these patients' immune system.\r"

The substance P antagonist, [D-Arg1,D-Phe5,Trp7,9,Leu11]-substance P, reduced the response to neural stimulation and to exogenous substance P.

To examine this finding further and its possible role in development of tolerance to morphine, rats (150-175 g) were injected with 1 ml of a sustained-release morphine preparation (40 mg/ml). Control rats received 1 ml of the oily vehicle. Antinociception, decreased locomotor activity, respiratory depression and mydriasis were measured at various times from 0.5 through 96 hr of exposure to the drug. Particulate and soluble cGMP hydrolysis were measured for the same time periods from periaqueductal gray (PAG), striatum, medulla and oculomotor nucleus, the brain areas believed to mediate the respective behaviors. Each of the behaviors except mydriasis showed development of complete tolerance (no difference from control behaviors) during the 96 hr of continuous exposure. During development of tolerance, particulate cGMP hydrolysis decreased in PAG and increased in striatum and medulla. Particulate cGMP hydrolysis was not altered in oculomotor nucleus, the brain area mediating mydriasis to which tolerance development was partial or incomplete. Significant changes in soluble cGMP hydrolysis occurred only in PAG before decline in the behavioral effect and did not appear to be involved in tolerance phenomena. Modulation of cyclic nucleotide levels by changes in particulate cGMP hydrolysis may produce or allow for development of complete tolerance to various morphine-induced behaviors.\r"

The methylxanthines themselves did not cause hepatotoxicity in any induction state. In 3-methylcholanthrene-induced rats, each methylxanthine afforded protection (in varying degrees) against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity as reflected by serum alanine aminotransferase and liver histopathology determined 24 hr after acetaminophen administration. However, in phenobarbital-induced rats, caffeine and theophylline substantially potentiated the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen whereas theobromine had no effect. Hepatic glutathione (GSH) was determined in rats that received caffeine 4 hr after acetaminophen or vehicle. Acetaminophen alone substantially depleted hepatic GSH in each induction state, whereas caffeine depleted hepatic GSH in uninduced and phenobarbital-induced, but not in 3-methylcholanthrene-induced rats. In rats that received both caffeine and acetaminophen together, hepatic GSH depletion was greater than in rats that received acetaminophen only. The effect of caffeine on hepatic GSH is most likely due to a decrease in core body temperature. The most likely mechanisms for the effects observed are 1) inhibition of acetaminophen reactive metabolite formation in 3-methylcholanthrene-induced animals by each of the methylxanthines, and 2) activation of the phenobarbital-inducible forms of cytochrome(s) P-450 toward formation of acetaminophen reactive metabolites by caffeine and theophylline, but not theobromine.\r"

Known PNMT inhibitors used to lower blood pressure have invariably shown alpha adrenergic activity as a side effect. A search for new inhibitors disclosed that CGS 19281A (4,9-dihydro-7-methoxy-3H-pyrido[3,4b]indole) inhibits PNMT (IC50, 2.7 x 10(-6) M) without interacting with the alpha-1 or alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. CGS 19281A (20 mg/kg i.v.) reduced PNMT activity (60% decrease; P less than 0.001) and adrenaline concentration (38%; P less than .025) in the brainstem of normal rats. In conscious deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats, CGS 19281A (20 mg/kg i.v.) decreased blood pressure (50 mm Hg; P less than .001) and heart rate (26-36%; P less than .001) for 3 hr. Elevated brainstem adrenaline levels in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt rats were decreased by CGS 19281A (42%; P less than .005) whereas i.c.v. administration of CGS 19281A (845 nmol/rat) to conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats decreased blood pressure (20 mm Hg; P less than .010) and heart rate (84 beats/min; P less than .001) as well. Therefore, CGS 19281A may be useful for the study of the function of PNMT and adrenaline in the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "The tetradecapeptide somatostatin-14 (SS-14) has been found to alter electrogenic ion transport in the rat, guinea pig and rabbit intestinal mucosa in vitro. In this study, the actions of SS-14 and related peptides on mucosal ion transport were investigated in the intestinal tract of the pig, a species whose digestive physiology is similar to man. The contraluminal- but not luminal-side administration of SS-14 (1-1000 nmol/l) to sheets of mucosa-submucosa obtained from different regions of the porcine small intestine and colon produced rapid, sustained decreases in short-circuit current (lsc), a measure of active ion transport, that were localized to segments of the distal jejunum. The magnitude of this peptide action was greater in tissues manifesting a serosapositive basal potential difference greater than 0 mV than in those displaying a spontaneous potential difference less than 0 mV. Under basal conditions, SS-14 produced a maximum decrease in distal jejunal lsc which was nearly twice that produced by its synthetic analog SMS 201,995 (octreotide); the two peptides inhibited lsc with similar potencies. SS-14 (10 nmol/l) increased the lumen-to-serosa transepithelial Cl flux and eliminated net residual flux. Mucosal lsc responses to SS-14 were absent in tissues bathed in HCO3-free media. Peptide actions were generally resistant to inhibitors of epithelial anion exchange, Na-proton exchange and NaCl cotransport. The adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (1 mumol/l) and the cyclic AMP analog 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (0.3 mmol/l) evoked net Cl secretion which was associated with rapid and sustained elevations in lsc.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Neurons located in the myenteric plexus are generally believed responsible for motor control of intestinal circular muscle. The in vitro isometric responses of naive and myenterically denervated (MD) rat jejunal circular muscle to bethanechol and carbachol, alone and in the presence and absence of neuronal antagonists (hexamethonium bromide, tetrodotoxin and Botulinum toxin A) 15 and 30 days after myenteric plexus ablation, were determined. The responses to bethanechol indicated no differences in muscarinic sensitivity between naive and MD tissue. The relative potency of carbachol, which acts at both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, in MD tissue 15 days after denervation was significantly higher than that in naive tissue. However, 30 days after denervation, the relative potencies of carbachol in naive and MD circular muscle were comparable. The presence of neuronal antagonists had no effect on the relative potency of carbachol 15 days after myenteric denervation, but altered significantly the responses 30 days after denervation. The effects produced by the neuronal antagonists 30 days after myenteric denervation were qualitatively and quantitatively different than those produced in naive tissue, suggesting that the nature of the innervation in these tissues was different. These results demonstrate that circular muscle was denervated initially after myenteric plexus ablation but reinnervation occurred within 30 days. The reinnervation observed is likely due to neurons located in the submucosal plexus.\r"

Intraventricularly administered PTH 1-34 produced naloxone-insensitive antinociception in both the tail-flick and hot-plate tests. PTH 1-34 antinociceptive effects in the tail-flick test were blocked by i.c.v. salmon calcitonin (sCT, 2 micrograms) and i.c.v. calcium chloride (0.12 mumol). [tyrosine-34]b-PTH (7-34)NH2, the PTH antagonist, did not block PTH 1-34-induced antinociception. PTH 1-34 (2 micrograms) was additive with antinociceptive doses of sCT, but not morphine, in the hot-plate test. PTH 44-68 (0.3 micrograms/mouse, icv.) produced hyperalgesic effects 30 min after administration using the hot-plate test. PTH 44-68 (2 micrograms/mouse) attenuated sCT-induced but not morphine-induced antinociception in both the hot-plate and tail-flick tests. PTH 64-84 was inactive in all tests, alone or in combination with sCT or morphine. Due to the low efficacy of PTH 1-34 and 44-68 in antinociceptive tests, these PTH fragments may act as modulators of antinociception rather than directly producing antinociceptive or hyperalgesic effects. In addition, the results indicate that sCT and the PTH fragments 1-34 and 44-68 may interact in the modulation of nonopiate antinociception, possibly via opposing actions on calcium in the brain.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to re-evaluate the effects of cocaine on cardiac responses elicited by sympathetic nerve stimulation. Cats anesthetized with pentobarbital and subjected to spinal cord transection were used. Control heart rate increases were obtained to submaximal stimulation of postganglionic accelerator nerves, before and after i.v. bolus doses of cocaine ranging from 0.0625 to 2.0 mg/kg. Maximal potentiation of heart rate increases elicited by nerve stimulation were observed with 0.25 mg/kg. In precocaine controls, stimulation increased sinus rate by 31 +/- beats/min; 30 sec to 1 min after cocaine (0.25 mg/kg), stimulation increased sinus rate by 55 +/- beats/min. Maximal potentiation (80 +/- 10%) was observed at 30 sec to 1 min after cocaine administration, and was usually over by 45 to 60 min later. Cocaine was repeated twice (0.25 mg/kg i.v.) at hourly intervals and the magnitude of potentiation was only 19 +/- 6 and 24 +/- 4%, respectively, indicating that tachyphylaxis had developed toward cocaine's potentiating effect. Dose-response studies indicated that as little as 0.0625 mg/kg of cocaine can potentiate heart rate increases elicited by sympathetic nerve stimulation. Doubling the dose to 0.125 mg/kg, and again to 0.25 mg/kg, resulted in a linear dose-related increase in the magnitude of potentiation. However, doubling the dose again to 0.5 mg/kg and increasing this dose by 4-fold to 2 mg/kg did not result in additional potentiation. Indeed, there was a significant drop-off in the magnitude of potentiation to nerve stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of nicotine on prolactin release were studied in conscious, unrestrained rats in which an indwelling jugular cannula allowed multiple samplings of blood after i.v. administration of nicotine. Intravenous administration of nicotine bitartrate dihydrate increases plasma prolactin concentrations in a dose-dependent manner with an ED50 of approximately 100 micrograms/kg (200 nmol/kg) and this effect is blocked completely by pretreatment with mecamylamine, indicating that it is mediated by a nicotinic cholinergic receptor. Intracerebral ventricular injection of 1 microgram of nicotine also increases plasma prolactin levels, but i.v. injection of this same amount of nicotine has no effect, indicating that nicotine acts within the brain to release prolactin. A single i.v. injection of nicotine resulted in desensitization of the prolactin response to a subsequent injection of nicotine given 1 to 2 hr later, thus confirming a previous report by Sharp and Beyer (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 238: 486-491, 1986). The prolactin response to nicotine was restored within 24 hr after a single injection. The acute desensitization after a single injection of nicotine appears to be specific to release of prolactin by nicotine because the prolactin response to morphine was unaffected 1 hr after injection of nicotine. A single injection of nicotine appears to desensitize the prolactin response to a subsequent injection of nicotine with an ED50 of approximately 20 micrograms/kg (40 nmol/kg), indicating that nicotine is even more potent in stimulating desensitization of nicotinic cholinergic receptors than in stimulating prolactin release. These results support the concept that nicotine acts as a time-averaged antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tail arteries were perfused in vitro, and norepinephrine released during adrenergic nerve stimulation was collected and analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. There was no progressive change with age in norepinephrine content in the tail artery, although content at 6 months was significantly less than 12 months. The most significant finding was a decline with age in the effect of the alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist yohimbine to increase norepinephrine release, suggesting an age- related fall in the effectiveness of prejunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptor activation. In the absence of drugs there was an age-related increase in fractional norepinephrine release, and an age-related increase in the effect of deoxycorticosterone and cocaine was also seen. The increased effect of deoxycorticosterone and cocaine appears to be related to increased norepinephrine levels in the junctional cleft as opposed to an age-related increase in the activity of catecholamine metabolism and uptake. These results suggest that the age-related increase in fractional norepinephrine release may be due, in part, to a decline in negative feedback mediated by prejunctional alpha-2 adrenergic receptors.\r"

The first preparation was the rat mesenteric vascular bed which was constricted by phenylephrine (EC80) and perfused with CsA (8.32 x 10(-8) to 8.32 x 10(-6) M). Vasodilation responses to acetylcholine, bradykinin and the calcium ionophore, A23187, were impaired, as was the response to sodium nitroprusside at high CsA concentrations. Indomethacin had no effect suggesting that the CsA effect is unrelated to the synthesis of cyclooxygenase products. In the second preparation, thoracic aortic rings from rats treated with CsA (5-10 and 20-50 mg/kg/daily for 3 and 1 weeks, respectively) were used. Aorta rings precontracted by phenylephrine (EC80) also showed impaired responses to both endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside) vasodilators. Furthermore, a marked decrease of the guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) content in aortic preparations was found to accompany the in vivo effect of CsA on relaxation. In addition, exposure of aortic rings to CsA (8.32 x 10(-8) to 8.32 x 10(-6) M) in vitro, also inhibited markedly the cGMP response induced by acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside. This effect of CsA was not modified by isobutyl methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. We conclude that CsA acts directly on the vascular smooth muscle; and speculate that CsA may compromise the response to vasodilators by inhibiting cGMP formation.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to characterize 5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2) receptors in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFc) by single cell recording and microiontophoretic techniques. This was accomplished using 5-HT2 receptor agonists 1-[2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl]-2-aminopropane [(+/-)-DOI] and 1-[2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenyl]-2-aminopropane [(+/-)-DOB]. DOI ejected at a low current (0.5 nA) potentiates glutamate (GLU)-induced activation of mPFc neurons and this effect is blocked by spiperone. At higher currents. DOI invariably inhibits GLU-induced neuronal activity. The microiontophoretic ejection of both DOI and DOB predominantly inhibits spontaneously active mPFc cells. The inhibitory action of DOI on spontaneously active cells is dose-dependent and is blocked by putative 5-HT2 receptor antagonists, with a rank order of potency as follows: ritanserin greater than metergoline approximately LY-53857 greater than spiperone greater than mesulergine greater than mianserin approximately ketanserin. Interestingly, ketanserin and mianserin only weakly block the effect of DOI. The suppressant action of DOI is probably not related to its interaction with 5-HT10 sites as spiperone, which has low affinity for these sites, potently blocks the effect of DOI. The suppressant effect of DOI is not blocked by other receptor antagonists such as BRL-43694 (5-HT3), (+/-)-pindolol (5HT 1a,1b, beta adrenergic, beta), prazosin (adrenergic1, alpha-1), pyrilamine (histamine1, H1), l-sulpiride (dopamine2, D2) or SR 95103 (gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABAA). Overall our results indicate that DOI predominantly inhibits mPFc cells in a direct manner and this effect is mediated by 5-HT2 receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bolus injections of 2.5, 25 and 125 nmol of SP caused a dose-dependent bradycardia, with the largest dose decreasing heart rate by 53% of base line. Pretreatment with 1 microM atropine blocked the negative chronotropic response to 25 nmol of SP. Pretreatment with 0.5 microM neostigmine lowered base-line heart rate and potentiated the negative chronotropic response to 25 nmol of SP. A potent vasodilator response to SP was demonstrated after elevation of base-line perfusion pressure with 1 microM [Arg8]vasopressin or 40 mM KCl. The vasodilator effect of SP was dose-dependent and occurred at much lower doses than required to affect heart rate. The ED50 for vasodilation was less than 1 pmol in both preparations. In hearts with vascular tone increased by vasopressin, atropine (1 microM) decreased the maximum vasodilator response to SP by 23%, but neither atropine nor a combination of 10 microM cimetidine and 1 microM chlorpheniramine affected the ED50 for SP. These results suggest that SP causes bradycardia by stimulating cholinergic neurons and coronary vasodilation by some mechanism not involving either acetylcholine or histamine. Acetylcholine may, however, contribute to the maximum vasodilator response to SP.\r"

Previous investigations have focused on potential ventricular dysrhythmias and myocardial ischemic events from enhanced autonomic tone or seizure activity from central stimulation. However, cocaine is a local anesthetic and may impair cardiac conduction. To evaluate this, 16 conscious dogs received i.v. cocaine over 30 sec to mimic \"recreational\" use in doses of 3 mg/kg (n = 6), 5 mg/kg (n = 6) or 7 mg/kg (n = 4). Another group of anesthetized dogs (n = 6) received two infusions of cocaine (5 mg/kg) 1 hr apart. Plasma cocaine levels and His bundle electrograms were obtained at control and at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 10 and 15 min after cocaine administration. At 0.5 min, plasma cocaine reached peak levels of 30.0, 45.0 and 59.6 micrograms/ml with increasing dose. Cocaine rapidly produced severe prolongation of His to ventricle interval and widening of the R wave. Slowing of conduction was dose-dependent, with maximal increases in His to venticle interval of 37 to 56% (P = .0299) and R wave duration of 34 to 77% (P less than .025). Furthermore, significant conduction impairment developed at cocaine levels that did not produce seizures. Conduction effects were equally pronounced during repeated administration of cocaine. These data indicate that cocaine causes marked conduction slowing, which could play an important role in cocaine death.\r"

  ".W": "To exploit the well documented effect of 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (2,3-DPG) in enhancing oxygen delivery by human erythrocytes, we have investigated whether the DPG synthase/phosphatase enzyme system can be targeted to increase DPG levels in the cell. The hydrolytic activity (phosphatase) of the DPG metabolizing enzyme complex exhibits a marked dependence on a physiological effector, 2-phosphoglycolate. Little phosphatase activity is detected in the absence of this activator irrespective of the concentrations of the substrate. The phosphoglycolate-dependent phosphatase activity is competitively inhibited by a glycolytic intermediate, 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA). The 3-PGA inhibition persists when the 2,3-DPG concentration is raised to saturation level. In contrast, 3-PGA enhances the DPG synthase activity in a dose-dependent manner. In intact red cells, one-half of the cellular DPG content is depleted after 6 hr at 37 degrees C in glucose-free medium. The rate of 2,3-DPG degradation is accelerated when the cellular level of phosphoglycolate is increased by incubation with exogenous glycolate. Together, these results indicate that 2,3-DPG content in erythrocytes can be directly regulated through modulation of phosphatase/synthase activities. In support of this notion, a pyruvate kinase inhibitor, L-alanine, increases by 2-fold the cellular 3-PGA level. This is accompanied by a significant increase (30%) in 2,3-DPG content in human red blood cells. It is postulated that the DPG-promoting action of 3-PGA is mediated through simultaneous phosphatase inhibition and synthase activation. Furthermore, as a result of increased DPG accumulation, the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve in L-alanine-treated cells is rightward shifted by 2.5 torr.\r"

Under urethane-induced anesthesia, AA (6.6-66 mumol) was injected directly into the lumen of the isolated intestinal loop in situ and all mesenteric venous (portal) blood coming from the loop collected continuously for 60 min. Acetaminophen-glucuronide (AA-glucuronide) and acetaminophen-sulfate (AA-sulfate) were the only phase II metabolites of AA consistently detected. At low doses (less than or equal to 14 mumol), AA-glucuronide was the major intestinal metabolite of AA formed. Intestinal glucuronidation became saturated at higher doses of AA. The maximum concentration of AA-glucuronide attained in the portal blood was similar after administration of 14, 30 or 66 mumol of AA. In contrast, the extent of intestinal sulfation of AA increased with each increment in dose and, ultimately, exceeded intestinal glucuronidation at the highest dose studied (66 mumol). In an attempt to ameliorate saturation of intestinal glucuronidation, glucose (5 or 50 mM) was administered with 66 mumol of AA. Intestinal AA glucuronidation was unaffected by glucose coadministration. Unexpectedly, the intestinal absorption of AA was increased and sulfation of AA decreased by co-administration of glucose. These data indicate that intestinal phase II biotransformation of AA is dose-dependent, with glucuronidation predominating at low doses and sulfation increasing in importance at high doses. Furthermore, intestinal glucuronidation is capacity-limited at relatively low doses of AA. These observations demonstrate sharp contrasts between the ability of the intestine and liver to biotransform AA.\r"

Some authors have applied this technique without accounting for the variability in the data or without adjusting for multiple comparisons to the line of additivity. This paper develops a graphical procedure which takes into account the variability of the data and which maintains favorable statistical properties. The isobolographic procedure utilized is illustrated by using three classical pharmacological drug combinations in female ICR mice. An additive relationship is illustrated with the loss of righting reflex after combinations of doses of sodium hexobarbital with itself. An antagonistic relationship is illustrated with the protection by mecamylamine of nicotine-induced lethality. A synergistic relationship is illustrated with the loss of righting reflex after combinations of ethanol and chloral hydrate. The procedure's statistical properties (level of significance and power) were determined using a simulation study. The isobolographic procedures developed here are applicable for quantal, continuous and count data. These procedures are applicable for identifying beneficial drug combinations, or conversely, identifying hazards resulting from exposure to multiple toxicants.\r"

At each of these time points, the binding of [3H]acetylcholine in the hypothalamus from rats treated chronically with nicotine was significantly higher than in the hypothalamus from control rats. By 14 days after the last chronic injection of nicotine, the prolactin response to an acute injection of nicotine was restored. Coinciding with the return of the nicotine-induced prolactin response, the binding of [3H]acetylcholine had returned to control values. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that nicotine inactivates nicotinic cholinergic receptors in brain by an allosteric mechanism, and that prolonged inactivation of nicotinic cholinergic receptors leads to their increased number.\r"

ZG was hydrolyzed rapidly in vivo by both guinea pigs and rabbits, liberating Z. The effect of inhibition of tissue esterases was determined by administration of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) concurrently with i.v. doses of Z or ZG to anesthetized, bile duct ligated guinea pigs. Administration of PMSF decreased the apparent plasma clearance of ZG by 86% and elevated the apparent plasma clearance of Z by 300%. Exposure of the guinea pigs to ZG as measured by the area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC) was increased substantially by PMSF treatment. Covalent binding of Z to plasma proteins in the guinea pig correlated well with AUC of ZG, but not with AUC of Z. The correlation of Z covalent binding with AUC of ZG in the guinea pig is similar to that found in humans suggesting that the degree to which acyl glucuronides form covalent adducts with proteins in humans may be predictable from studies in animals.\r"

A single 2-mg dose of BW942C increased urine output 5-fold over control values in humans. In Long-Evans rats, BW942C produced a biphasic dose-response curve for urine output with lower doses increasing and higher doses suppressing output. Low doses of naltrexone antagonized the antidiuresis, and high doses antagonized the diuresis produced by BW942C. BW942C was less efficacious in producing diuresis than the full kappa agonists bremazocine and U50,488H (trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]- benzeneacetamide methanesulfonate, hydrate). Furthermore, BW942C antagonized the diuretic effects of bremazocine and U50,488H. Rats tolerant to U50,488H-induced diuresis were cross-tolerant to BW942C. In Brattleboro rats, which are unable to synthesize vasopressin, BW942C failed to produce a diuretic effect, demonstrating the necessity of vasopressin for its diuretic response. In the kappa-selective rabbit vas deferens bioassay, BW942C was less efficacious than a full agonist, it was antagonized by naloxone and BW942C in nondepressant doses antagonized a full agonist. In binding studies, BW942C had the highest affinity for mu and delta opioid receptors and an intermediate affinity for kappa opioid receptors. The data suggest that BW942C has the property of a partial kappa opioid agonist in addition to being a mu agonist.\r"

Despite temporal declines in Mp and cycling during continued activation, stress is maintained at high levels. This observation led to several different hypotheses describing the regulation of steady-state stress. One proposal is that protein kinase C regulates stress maintenance, whereas another invokes a steady-state dependence on Ca+(+)-calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of stress-maintenance by analyzing the inhibitory efficacy of a protein kinase C inhibitor, H-7 [1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperizine], on steady-state values of stress, Mp and crossbridge cycling in rabbit renal and femoral arteries. H-7 effectively inhibited steady-state stress produced by KCl (IC50 = 3.7-4.4 microM) and phenylephrine (PhE) (IC50 = 10.6-15.2 microM). Likewise, increases in the level of Mp and the rate of crossbridge cycling induced by both KCl and PhE were significantly reduced by 10 microM H-7. H-7 did not reduce inositol phosphate production stimulated by PhE, but did reduce early stress development thought to be mediated by inositol phosphate-induced mobilization of intracellular calcium. Calcium-induced increases in stress and Mp produced in saponin-skinned artery strips were reduced by less than 50% by 320 microM H-7.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, the effects of in vitro exposure to a low concentration (20 mM) of ethanol have been examined in neurons obtained from both groups of animals. No differences were observed in the passive or synaptic membrane properties of dentate granule neurons obtained from control and chronically ethanol-exposed rats. Dentate granule neurons obtained from the two groups of animals also showed similar responses to in vitro exposure to 20 mM ethanol. Hippocampal CA1 neurons were also similar, except for the post-spike train afterhyperpolarization which was significantly prolonged in neurons from chronically ethanol-exposed animals. Exposure to 20 mM ethanol in vitro resulted in a significant increase in the amplitude and duration of the afterhyperpolarization in CA1 neurons obtained from control animals, but a significant decrease in CA1 neurons obtained from chronically ethanol-exposed rats. These results suggest that behavioral tolerance to ethanol is accompanied by adaptive changes in the electrophysiological responses of hippocampal CA1 neurons when tested with an acute exposure to ethanol. Chronic treatment with ethanol did not cause such adaptive changes in dentate gyrus granule neurons suggesting that they may be less sensitive to the effects of long-term exposure to ethanol than CA1 neurons.\r"

The concentrations of PL enantiomers in plasma (Cp) and tissues (e.g., lung, heart, brain, kidney, muscle and gastrointestinal tract) were determined at 5, 10, 30, 60 and 120 min after administration by chiral stationary-phase liquid chromatography. Plasma protein binding of PL enantiomers was evaluated by ultrafiltration. Values of tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient and tissue-to-plasma-free fraction were obtained. Cp for (+)-PL was consistently higher than that of (-)-PL in plasma. In contrast, (-)-PL showed a significantly higher distribution than (+)-PL in all tissues observed (P less than .05) at 60 min after administration of the racemate. As a result, the tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient-Cp curve was markedly different for the two enantiomers. However, because the plasma-free fraction of (+)-PL was less than that of (-)-PL, no remarkable difference was found between the concentration-dependent tissue-to-plasma-free concentration curves for the two enantiomers. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the uptake or binding of PL enantiomers to tissues is saturable and not stereoselective. Therefore, the apparent stereoselective tissue distribution of PL seems to be caused mainly by the difference in plasma protein binding of its enantiomers.\r"

  ".W": "The aminoergolines SDZ 208-911 [N-[(8-alpha)-2,6-dimethylergoline-8-yl]-2,2- dimethylpropanamide] and SDZ 208-912 [N-[8-alpha)-2-chloro-6-methylergoline-8-yl]- 2,2-dimethylpropanamide] exhibit nonclassical, neuroleptic-like properties in rodents. Thus, they are equipotent to haloperidol as inhibitors of apomorphine-induced gnawing behavior and conditioned avoidance responding, but are essentially devoid of cataleptogenic activity. In addition, they show high affinity for central D-2 receptors in vitro and elevate striatal homovanillic acid levels. In contrast to haloperidol, however, SDZ 208-911 and 208-912 strongly inhibit prolactin secretion and induce contralateral circling behavior in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned animals. These profiles are consistent with the drugs exhibiting varying degrees of partial agonistic activity at dopamine D-2 receptors, with SDZ 208-911 being considerably more agonistic than SDZ 208-912. Support for this contention stems from the ability of SDZ 208-911 to reduce the elevation of striatal L-dopa formation induced by gamma-butyrolactone, and SDZ 208-912's partial reversal of apomorphine's inhibitory action on gamma-butyrolactone activity. SDZ 208-911's effects are reduced after the partial alkylation of D-2 receptors with N-ethoxy-carbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline, confirming its partial agonistic properties. SDZ 208-911 and SDZ 208-912 could be effective against both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, while exhibiting a reduced incidence of dystonic and parkinsonian side-effects. In addition, their clinical testing might throw more light on the central dopaminergic status of schizophrenic subjects.\r"

Two min NMN or TEA unidirectional transepithelial flux and simultaneous cellular uptake were measured. Transport of NMN and TEA from basolateral to apical side was temperature-dependent, saturable and competitively inhibited by each other or by mepiperphenidol. NMN and TEA transport from the apical to the basolateral side was very slow, only slightly faster than that of mannitol. Apparent kinetic parameters of basolateral to apical transcellular flux were measured. For NMN apparent Km = 133.6 +/- 35.4 microM, Vmax = 48.3 +/- 5.6 pmol/cm2.2 min. For TEA apparent Km = 11.4 +/- 2.2 microM, Vmax = 42.1 +/- 1.8 pmol/cm2.2 min. Kinetic parameters of cellular uptake were also estimated. For NMN apparent Km = 436.9 +/- 139.8 microM, Vmax = 143.7 +/- 30.5 pmol/micrograms DNA. For TEA apparent Km = 50.3 +/- 7.2 microM, Vmax = 26.5 +/- 2.5 pmol/micrograms DNA. It is concluded that LLC-PK1 cells transport NMN and TEA from the basolateral to the apical side; this flux corresponds to the secretory transport of the renal proximal tubule. NMN and TEA share the same transport system, but NMN has a lower affinity.\r"

The density of [3H]idazoxan binding sites was 12-fold higher in purified basolateral membranes than in brush-border membranes (maximal binding activity, 566 +/- 118 vs. 46 +/- 2 fmol/mg of protein). In basolateral membranes, [3H]idazoxan binding was inhibited not only by imidazoline compounds but also by guanidinium analogs such as guanabenz, amiloride, 5-(M-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride and phenamylamiloride. Amiloride had no effect on the dissociation rate of [3H]idazoxan, suggesting a direct interaction of this molecule with the ligand binding site. [3H]Idazoxan binding was 80% inhibited by 150 mM K+ or Rb+. The effect of K+ appeared to occur through the interaction with an allosteric site in as much as both the apparent dissociation constant and the dissociation rate of [3H]idazoxan were increased in the presence of 75 mM K+. CDS inhibited [3H]idazoxan binding with a half-maximal effective concentration of 2 U/250 microliters. The competitive nature of CDS effect was indicated by the increase in the apparent dissociation constant of [3H]idazoxan (Kd from 3 +/- 0.3 to 8.5 +/- 0.2 nM, P less than .01) in the presence of CDS. In conclusion, our findings showed that the imidazoline-guanidinium receptive site is located mainly in the basolateral side of the tubular cell, recognizes CDS and is regulated by K+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacology of the alpha-2 adrenoceptor of the human adipocyte was improved by using some new alpha-2 antagonists from different chemical families (imidazolines, benzazepines and benzofuroquinolizines) in biological and binding assays. Moreover, investigations were also carried out to define the binding properties of a new imidazolinic antagonist, RX821002 [2-(2-methoxy-1,4-benzodioxan-2yl)-2-imidazoline], which could be a potential radioligand. [3H]RX821002 binding was very rapid and reversible. Saturation isotherms indicated that [3H]RX821002 labeled, with high affinity, a homogeneous population of noninteracting binding sites with a mean Kd of 0.98 +/- 0.05 nM (n = 6). The binding of [3H]RX821002 on the human fat cell alpha-2 adrenoceptor displayed a specificity which is strictly similar to that obtained with [3H]rauwolscine and which is classical for an alpha-2 A adrenoceptor. The binding parameters of [3H]RX821002 were compared with those obtained with the classical alpha-2 antagonist [3H]yohimbine. Analysis of the data indicate: 1) that [3H]RX821002 exhibited higher affinity; 2) that the nonspecific binding of [3H]RX821002 was very low; 3) that the total number of sites (maximum binding values) defined with [3H]RX821002 was significantly higher than that defined with [3H]yohimbine. This difference was not due to a specific preferential labeling of one of the two affinity states of the receptor, but suggested that [3H]yohimbine does not label the whole receptor population; 4) that [3H]RX821002 specific binding was less sensitive to magnesium chloride and GTP than [3H]yohimbine binding; and 5) that [3H]RX821002 can be used suitably for identification of alpha-2 adrenoceptors on the intact adipocyte.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The uptake was concentration proportional between 10(-8) and 10(-6) mol/l for all drugs investigated; the erythrocyte/medium ratio (E/M) was constant after 20 min in all experiments. In rat aortas and left atria drug uptake was measured in a 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffered medium (pH 7.2, 32 degrees C). Equilibrium was reached after 360 min and the tissue/medium ratio (T/M) was concentration proportional between 10(-8) and 10(-6) mol/l for all drugs. E/M or T/M ratios, respectively, increased in the order: erythrocytes less than aortas less than left atria. However, the particular drug/phospholipid ratios were relatively constant for the drugs investigated, indicating that the membranes were a major distribution phase for these drugs. For the catamphiphilic drugs, the E/M or T/M ratios correlated linearly with the EC50 for 45Ca displacement from phosphatidylserine monolayers, but were poorly correlated with the octanol-water coefficient of the unchanged molecules. The EC50 for 45Ca displacement from phosphatidylserine monolayers is a measure for the uptake of the protonated species of catamphiphilic drugs into erythrocytes or tissue and may be a good estimate of tissue uptake of these drugs in general.\r"

Bombesin (3 x 10(-10) to 3 X 10(-7) M) induced contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. The contractions induced by bombesin at concentrations of 10(-9) M and less were tetrodotoxin- and scopolamine-sensitive, and those induced at concentrations of 10(-8) M and greater were tetrodotoxin-sensitive, and partially scopolamine-sensitive. In association with the mechanical response to bombesin, the peptide induced Ca(++)-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive release of acetylcholine from the LM-MP preparation. Bicuculine inhibited partly both the cholinergic contraction and the release of acetylcholine induced by bombesin, suggesting the involvement of a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic mechanism. Bombesin also induced Ca(++)-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive release of endogenous and [3H]GABA from the LM-MP preparation. These results indicate that bombesin induces contraction mainly mediated mediated by cholinergic and partially mediated by noncholinergic excitatory neurons. GABAergic neurons may be involved in a part of the response to bombesin mediated by the cholinergic neuron.\r"

With the present study we took advantage from such a rat model of chronic uremia and decided to identify the component(s) of the conjugated estrogen mixture responsible for shortening the bleeding time. Moreover, we wanted to clarify whether estrogen effect on primary hemostasis is due to a receptor mechanism and can be neutralized by specific estrogen receptor antagonists such as tamoxifen or clomiphene. Both estrone sulfate and 17 beta-estradiol, but not equilin, were effective in shortening the prolonged bleeding time of uremic rats. 17 beta-Estradiol was the most active component of the mixture, reproducing the time course of bleeding time shortening of the entire mixture (effect lasting 48 hr). The effect of estrone sulfate injection lasted only 24 hr. Tamoxifen and clomiphene pretreatment prevented the shortening of bleeding time induced by conjugated estrogen mixture and its active components. These findings indicate that 17 beta-estradiol is the key compound of the conjugated estrogen mixture effective on bleeding time shortening and that the effect of estrogens on primary hemostasis is mediated by a receptor mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of acidified sodium nitrite (NaNO2) which releases nitric oxide, a substance which is thought to be indistinguishable from endothelium-derived relaxing factor, were investigated in a 6-h model of myocardial ischemia (MI) with reperfusion in open-chest, anesthetized cats. Acidified NaNO2 (12.5-50 mmol/kg/hr) was infused i.v., starting 30 min postocclusion followed by reperfusion 1 hr later, in cats subjected to MI by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Acidified NaNO2 infusion (25 and 50 mmol/kg/hr) resulted in significantly lower plasma creatine kinase activities at every time beyond 1 hr for the MI + vehicle group, and was not significantly different when compared to sham MI + NaNO2 controls. The areas at risk expressed as percentage of the total left ventricular weights were not significantly different between the MI + vehicle and MI + acidified NaNO2 groups. However, the necrotic area expressed as a percentage of the myocardial area at risk was significantly lower in the 25 and 50 mmol/kg/hr NaNO2-treated cats. Cardiac myeloperoxidase activities indicated that significantly fewer neutrophils were attracted to the ischemic zone of the NaNO2-treated MI cats when compared to the vehicle-infused MI cats. Acidified NaNO2 significantly inhibited platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner in cat platelet-rich plasma. Thus, acidified NaNO2 exerts a significant protective action during ischemia and reperfusion injury, which suggests that endothelium-derived relaxing factor has a cardioprotective effect in MI.\r"

  ".W": "This study examines the effects of ketoconazole, R 75 251 and some other cytochrome P-450 inhibitors on the in vivo metabolism of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) in normal rats. Oral treatment with ketoconazole or R 75 251 (40 mg/kg, -1 hr) reduced the elimination rate of i.v. injected RA from plasma: the half-life of RA increased from 27 min in control-treated animals to 43 min and 76 min after dosing with ketoconazole and R 75 251, respectively. However, neither drug had an effect on the distribution volume of the retinoid. Two hours after i.v. injection of RA, residual plasma levels of the retinoid were 11.2 ng/ml in ketoconazole and 22.7 ng/ml in R 75 251-treated rats. The other P-450 inhibitors, aminoglutethimide, cimetidine, itraconazole, metyrapone and saperconazole, showed no sparing effect on RA elimination: plasma levels of the acid were below 1 ng/ml, as in control-treated animals. Administration of ketoconazole or R 75 251 (40 mg/kg, -2 hr) to rats also enhanced endogenous plasma concentrations of RA. Levels of the retinoid were raised from mostly undetectable values (less than 0.5 ng/ml) to 1.3 +/- 0.1 and 2.5 0.1 ng/ml after treatment with ketoconazole and R 75 251, respectively. These data are indicative of the important contribution of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system to the in vivo metabolic process of RA. In vivo inhibition of the P-450 pathway not only increased the biological half-life of exogenously administered RA, but also enhanced the endogenous plasma level of this vitamin A derivative.\r"

On the other hand, PGF2 alpha-induced contractions were not influenced by indomethacin and aspirin, but were suppressed by treatment with ONO3708 and OKY046. Treatment with indomethacin or aspirin potentiated the contractile response of monkey mesenteric arteries, whereas treatment with ONO3708 and removal of endothelium did not alter the response significantly. Saralasin abolished the response to ANG II in these arteries. These findings may indicate that ANG II contracts monkey and dog cerebral arteries by activation of ANG II receptors mainly in endothelium, releasing arachidonic acid and synthesizing vasoconstrictor PGs, such as PGF2 alpha, E2, A2 and D2. Involvement of thromboxane A2 is if any minimal. Vasoconstrictor and dilator PGs released by ANG II appear to modify differently the contraction caused by direct actions of the octapeptide on smooth muscle in monkey cerebral and mesenteric arteries.\r"

  ".W": "The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor mediating endothelium-dependent relaxation of pig coronary arteries was characterized using a variety of 5-HT receptor agonists and antagonists. Unrubbed (with endothelium preserved) rings precontracted by prostaglandin F2 alpha in the presence of ketanserin relaxed in an endothelium-dependent manner to 5-HT, 5-carboxamidotryptamine and 5-methoxytryptamine with about equal potency and efficacy. By comparison, bufotenine, 3-(dimethylamino)ethyl-N-methyl-1H-indole-5-methane sulfonamide, (-)-alpha-methyl-5-HT,N,N-dipropyl-5-carboxamidotryptamine and 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-1H indole were half-efficient and other drugs [in particular the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin] were inactive as agonists up to 0.1 mM. The effect of 5-carboxamidotryptamine was antagonized in an apparently competitive manner by 15 drugs. Among the most potent antagonists (mean pKB value) were the nonselective 5-HT receptor antagonists, methiothepin (7.30) and metergoline (6.86), the 5-HT1A/5-HT1D receptor ligand, 1-[2-(4-amino-phenyl)ethyl]-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-piperazine (7.02), the 5-HT1A/5-HT1B/5-HT1D receptor ligand, 7-trifluoromethyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-pyrrolo[1,2,-a]quinoxaline 1 (6.73) and yohimbine (6.37). Selective ligands for 5-HT1A receptors were either inactive [8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide] or poorly active (spiperone, 4.44). Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with affinity for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors weakly antagonized the effect of 5-carboxamidotryptamine (pKB values less than or equal to 5.32), as did the 5-HT1c/5-HT2 receptor antagonist, mesulergine (5.30) and the yohimbine isomer, corynanthine (4.85). Methysergide was clearly a noncompetitive antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Zaprinast (3-30 microM) potentiated relaxation induced by sodium nitroprusside but not by isoproterenol or VIP. A small potentiation of relaxation to EFS was induced by 30 microM zaprinast but not by lower concentrations. Tetrodotoxin attenuated relaxations induced by EFS suggesting that they are at least partly neurogenic in origin. SK&F 94120 and zaprinast had no effect of tetrodotoxin-resistant relaxation to EFS. The guanylate cyclase inhibitor had no effect on EFS-induced relaxation. These findings suggest that cyclic AMP may mediate relaxation of guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle in response to stimulation of i-NANC nerves, and are in agreement with the view that VIP may be the neurotransmitter released by i-NANC nerves in this tissue.\r"

In perfused mesenteric vascular beds, PNS (1-12 Hz, for 30 sec) caused a frequency-dependent increase in the perfusion pressure, which was prevented by 50 nM prazosin and abolished by 300 nM tetrodotoxin and 5 microM guanethidine. Bolus infusion of norepinephrine (NE, 0.5 and 1 nmol) also produced a pressor response which was blocked by 50 nM prazosin. In the preparation treated with 500 nM capsaicin for 20 min, pressor responses to PNS of 1 to 8 Hz were potentiated significantly. The pressor responses to NE infusion also were enhanced in both the preparations treated with and without capsaicin. In the capsaicin-untreated preparation contracted by 7 mM methoxamine in the presence of 5 microM guanethidine, PNS (1-12 Hz) caused a frequency-dependent vasodilation, which was abolished by 300 nM tetrodotoxin. However, no vasodilator response to PNS was observed in the preparation treated with capsaicin. In the contracted preparation, bolus infusion of rat CGRP (10 and 100 pmol) produced a marked long-lasting vasodilation which mimicked the PNS-evoked vasodilation, whereas neither bolus infusion of substance P (1 and 10 nmol), neurokinin A (1 and 10 nmol) nor neurokinin B (1 and 10 nmol) produced relaxation. In the preparation labeled with [3H]NE, the PNS (4 Hz)-evoked 3H release was not altered after capsaicin treatment, whereas the pressor response to PNS was potentiated significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Specific binding of [3H]paroxetine to coronal sections of diencephalon represented 85% of total binding and was saturable and of high affinity (KD, 0.36 +/- 0.07 nM) with a maximum number of binding sites of 276 +/- 41 fmol/mg protein. The autoradiograms showed a heterogenous distribution of [3H]paroxetine in brain with selective accumulation of label in brain regions known to contain serotonergic terminals, axons and cell bodies (amygdaloid and raphe nuclei, superior colliculus, substantia nigra and medial forebrain bundle). Binding was displaced selectively with other serotonin uptake inhibitors (clomipramine and fluoxetine) and almost abolished by lesioning the serotonergic neurons with p-chloroamphetamine. The desipramine-sensitive [3H]imipramine binding was more diffuse with relatively high density in cerebral cortex and hippocampus and was only decreased partially in animals treated with p-chloroamphetamine. The results indicate that [3H]paroxetine, but not [3H]imipramine, is a ligand of choice to selectively label serotonergic structures in brain.\r"

  ".W": "During lung development, beta adrenergic receptors undergo transient coupling to enzymes and physiological processes which govern respiratory function and trophic responses to neural stimulation. To determine the role of endogenous catecholamines in mediating these processes, we examined the gestational and postnatal effects of chronic propranolol infusion (10 mg/kg/day) throughout fetal development. The effectiveness of receptor blockade in dam and fetus were confirmed through measurements of heart rate and enzymatic stimulatory responses to acute challenge with beta agonists (terbutaline to isoproterenol). Propranolol antagonized the ability of terbutaline to stimulate fetal lung fluid resorption and phosphatidic acid phosphatase, a key enzyme in surfactant synthesis. After birth, basal lung compliance and the compliance response to beta adrenergic stimulation were compromised in the neonates that had been exposed to propranolol before birth, despite the fact that direct receptor antagonism had disappeared by that time. After weaning, animals exposed to prenatal propranolol showed interference with basal activity of ornithine decarboxylase (an enzyme involved in transduction of neuronal and hormonal trophic stimuli) and its response to acute beta adrenergic challenge. These results suggest that endogenous fetal catecholamines participate in perinatal respiratory adaptation to air-breathing and help to program future cellular responsiveness to neuronal input.\r"

Physical, biochemical and morphological evaluations revealed that the lung is viable for up to 5 hr. No significant alterations in the architecture of the bronchiolar epithelium were observed by light or electron microscopy, despite evidence of interstitial and peribronchial edema. Although increases in pulmonary arterial pressure were noted at 5 hr, lung wet/dry weight was elevated only minimally (11%). Glutathione levels remained stable for the first 3 hr but fell to 57 +/- 14% of control at 5 hr. Naphthalene monooxygenase activity was not altered significantly during 5 hr of perfusion. Perfusion of the lung with naphthalene resulted in swelling and vacuolation of Clara cells followed by concentration-dependent losses of this cell type from the bronchiolar epithelium. Clara cells comprised 63% of the epithelial cells in terminal airways of control mice; 10 mumol of naphthalene decreased this number to 30%. Perfusion with naphthalene resulted in concentration-dependent decreases in pulmonary glutathione. Reactive metabolites were bound covalently to protein in the lung and in the perfusate. This study is the first to provide unambiguous evidence that naphthalene-induced Clara cell necrosis can be mediated entirely by processes resident in the lung. In addition, this work validates the use of the isolated perfused mouse lung for studying the role of reactive metabolites produced in situ vs. those entering the lung via the circulation.\r"

  ".W": "Previous biochemical studies have suggested that tolbutamide and mephenytoin are metabolized by the same cytochrome P450 enzyme. Conversely, clinical studies indicate the involvement of different P450 forms in tolbutamide and mephenytoin metabolism. Our objective was to elucidate further those P450 enzymes responsible for hydroxylation of these two drugs. We studied both tolbutamide and (S)-mephenytoin hydroxylation in microsomes from 38 different normal adult human livers, and found large variability in the rates of metabolism for both reactions (1.75-47.4 nmol/mg/hr for hydroxytolbutamide formation and 0.1-7.2 nmol/mg/hr for 4-hydroxymephenytoin formation). No significant correlation was found between the two activities. However, both reactions shared common inhibitors in vitro, including inhibition by antikidney-liver-microsome autoantibodies (Meier and Meyer, Biochemistry 26: 8466-8474, 1987) and by teniposide. Two human liver cDNAs for P450s of the CYP2C subfamily designated IIC8 and IIC9 (S. Kimura, J. Pastewka, H. V. Gelboin and F. J. Gonzalez, Nucl. Acids Res. 15: 10053-10054, 1987), were functionally expressed in human HepG2 and TK- cells using a vaccinia virus vector. Interestingly, tolbutamide was hydroxylated by both expressed P450s. Only IIC9 catalyzed the 4-hydroxylation of (R)-mephenytoin and neither enzyme metabolized (S)-mephenytoin. We conclude that tolbutamide and (R)-mephenytoin are both metabolized by the same P450 enzyme, IIC9, and that tolbutamide is hydroxylated by an additional highly related enzyme, IIC8, contributing to the lack of correlation of the two hydroxylase activities among human liver microsomes and indicating the absence of a monogenically controlled polymorphism for tolbutamide.\r"

Contiguous segments were incubated in the presence of 86Rb and used for study of the effects of BRL-34915 on 86Rb efflux. BRL-34915 produced a dose-dependent relaxation of norepinephrine- or K(+)-induced active stress that was essentially complete (100%) in the aorta and mesenteric artery but only partial (30-40%) in the tail artery. The ED50 value of BRL-34915 for relaxation responses was about 0.1 to 0.3 microM. BRL-34915 had no significant sustained effect on 86Rb efflux from the tail artery or mesenteric artery branches but produced a dose-dependent sustained increase in efflux from thoracic aorta and portal vein. Responses reached a peak effect in 2 to 4 min after exposure but subsequently declined over a slower time course. Efflux responses to BRL-34915 had peak values that averaged 100 to 150% above basal levels with an ED50 value of about 1 to 3 microM. This suggests a dissociation of the effects of BRL-34915 in relaxation and efflux experiments. Treatment with 30 microM BRL-34915 decreased both the initial and sustained components of the subsequent 86Rb efflux response to 10 microM norepinephrine in both thoracic aorta and tail artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We therefore examined Na+,K(+)-pump activity in atrial tissue from two groups of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Fourteen patients received digoxin long-term until the time of surgery and 12 \"controls\" never received digoxin. The hyperpolarization produced by the electrogenic Na+,K(+)-pump in response to an increase in intracellular Na+ activity was utilized to evaluate Na+,K+)-pump activity. After excision from the patients, specimens of atrial tissue were Na(+)-loaded by cooling to 2-3 degrees C for 1 hr. They were then warmed to 30 degrees C in Tyrode's solution containing 20 mM K+. After warming the resting membrane potential of the tissues from both groups transiently hyperpolarized to levels more negative than the equilibrium potential for K+ (= approximately -50 mV in 20 mM K+) indicating that the hyperpolarization was the consequence of electrogenic Na(+(-pumping. The maximal hyperpolarization of the resting potential in tissue from patients receiving digoxin long-term (-58.4 +/- 1.9 mV, mean +/- S.D.) was significantly (P less than .01) less negative than that in tissue from patients in the control group (-69.9 +/- 2.2 mV). These data support the hypothesis that digoxin, administered therapeutically in the clinical setting, can inhibit the Na(+)-pump in human heart, and that during long-term administration of digoxin the inhibition can be sustained.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work in this laboratory has demonstrated a reduction by the nephrotoxic beta-lactam antibiotics cephaloridine, cephaloglycin and imipenem of renal mitochondrial uptake of and respiration with the anionic substrate succinate. The present studies were done to test further the hypothesis that reduced substrate uptake and decreased respiration are causally related. Using cephaloridine in the rabbit, we examined the specificity of this association in regard to the toxic cephalosporin insult, the involvement of renal mitochondria and the reduction of carrier-mediated anionic substrate transport. 1) Specificity of insult in renal cortical mitochondria: cephaloridine (300 mg/kg bwt. i.v., 1 hr before sacrifice) reduces both the uptake of and respiration with succinate, whereas the same dose of cephalexin, which is not nephrotoxic, has neither effect; 25 min of acute unilateral renal artery occlusion reduces both the uptake of and respiration with succinate, but, unlike cephaloridine, ischemia causes a large increase of substrate efflux; and the respiratory toxins cyanide (1 mM) and oligomycin (2 micrograms/g of protein) reduce respiration by a direct effect on the mitochondrial respiratory chain and therefore have no effect on substrate uptake. 2) Specificity of target organ: cephaloridine has no significant effect on either the uptake of or respiration with succinate in hepatic mitochondria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The influence of the epithelium on antagonism by ICI 204,219 of contractile responses to peptide leukotriene (LT) agonists was examined in guinea pig tracheal and human bronchial rings. The -log molar KB values for ICI 204,219 were found to be independent of the epithelium in both tissues. Even though uninfluenced by the epithelium, the -log molar KB values for ICI 204,219 were about 10-fold smaller in human airways than in guinea pig trachea. Removal of the epithelium from guinea pig trachea resulted in small leftward shifts of the concentration-response curves to LTC4 and LTD4 and rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves to LTE4 when examined in the presence of indomethacin. The potentiation of LTC4 and LTD4 by epithelium removal was not seen in the presence of inhibitors of the transformation of LTC4 to LTD4 and LTD4 to LTE4. The influence of the epithelium on responses to LTE4 remained in the presence of these metabolic inhibitors. The lipoxygenase inhibitors nordihydroguaiaretic acid, B755C, Rev 5901 and AA861 antagonized responses to LTE4 in the presence, but not in the absence of epithelium. In human airways, epithelium removal resulted in a small leftward shift of the concentration-response curve to LTD4 whereas responses to LTC4 and LTE4 were unaltered. This effect was not observed in the presence of indomethacin, relating it to reduced release of cyclooxygenase products. These data suggest that contractile responses of guinea pig trachea to LTE4 are modulated by LTE4-induced release of 5-lipoxygenase product(s) only when the epithelium is present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
