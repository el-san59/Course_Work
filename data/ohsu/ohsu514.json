SETTING--Outpatient department of a general hospital. SUBJECTS--All non-attenders (n = 277) for first outpatient appointments in six specialties during a three month period were included. Controls (n = 135) were the attenders who followed every second non-attender; thus they attended the same consultant on the same day that the non-attenders were expected. INTERVENTIONS--None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Information on the clinical problem, difficulties in attending the hospital, and reasons for non-attendance from the questionnaire were coded and classified. Non-attenders had received shorter notice of their appointment than attenders (14% v 1% had received three days' notice or less). There were small differences in the seriousness of patients' clinical condition. CONCLUSIONS--Client factors are less important than aspects of the service in explaining non-attendance at outpatient appointments.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare the presentation and natural course of first myocardial infarctions in immigrant Asians and the indigenous white population in Britain and the subsequent risk states of the two groups. DESIGN--Prospective ethnic comparison of consecutive patients with first myocardial infarctions. SETTING--Secondary referrals to a coronary care unit of a district general hospital. PATIENTS--128 Men (77 white, 54 Asian) presenting consecutively with a first myocardial infarction diagnosed on the basis of clinical, biochemical, and electrocardiographic findings. END POINT--Identification of mechanisms accounting for the increased rate of ischaemic heart disease in Asians. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Infarct size was assessed by measuring the release of creatine phosphokinase (all patients), radionuclide ventriculography (50), and contrast ventriculography (103). Risk states after infarction were assessed from the degree of ventricular dysfunction as determined by exercise electrocardiography (82 patients) and from the extent of coronary atheroma as determined by coronary arteriography (103). Glucose state was measured in fasting venous blood samples. Overall the relative rate of infarction was 4.9 times higher in Asians (95% confidence interval 3.4 to 6.9) than in the white population. Moreover, the relative rate of infarction was higher in Asians in all 10 year age groups, the greatest difference being in 30-39 year olds. The mean age of the Asian denominator population was 47.1 years compared with 49.5 years in the white population. Age at infarction was less in Asians (50.2 years) than in white patients (55.5 years; mean difference 5.5 years (95% confidence interval 2.5 to 7.1]. In Asians the mean creatine phosphokinase activity was 777 (95% confidence interval 155 to 1399) U/1 higher, radionuclide ejection fraction 8.9% (1.0% to 16.9%) lower, and left ventricular fractional shortening 4.8% (1.4% to 8.2%) lower than in white patients. The extent of coronary atheroma was significantly greater in Asians. The mean numbers of plaques in vessels not associated with infarction were 3.66 (median 3.0, range 0-10) in Asians compared with 1.97 (median 2.0, range 0-6) in white patients (p less than 0.001), and a higher proportion of Asians had three vessel coronary artery disease (p less than 0.001). Asians with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance did not differ from those with normal blood glucose values. CONCLUSIONS--Atherogenesis arises earlier in Asians, contributing to premature first myocardial infarctions. The increased incidence of diabetes in Asians may not in itself be relevant in the greater propensity to coronary atheroma in Asians.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess oesophageal Doppler ultrasonography as a convenient means of optimising positive end expiratory pressure for maximal delivery of oxygen to tissues. DESIGN--Measurements of blood flow, arterial oxygen saturation, and cardiac output by thermodilution (when available) at baseline and at 20-30 minutes after each incremental increase (2.5-5.0 cm H2O) in positive and expiratory pressure to a maximum of 20.0 cm H2O. If the cardiac output fell by more than 15% measurements were repeated after stepwise decreases in positive end expiratory pressure. No other manoeuvre such as endotracheal suction or changing ventilator settings, drug or fluid dosage, or the patient's position was performed for at least one hour before the start of the study or during it. SETTING--Intensive care unit. PARTICIPANTS--10 Patients being mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure who had stable haemodynamic and blood gas values and required a fractional inspired oxygen concentration of greater than or equal to 0.45. They were assessed on a total of 11 occasions. INTERVENTIONS--Incremental increases in positive end expiratory pressure followed when indicated by stepwise decreases. END POINT--The positive end expiratory pressure providing maximal delivery of oxygen to tissues. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS--Arterial oxygen saturation increased with positive end expiratory pressure in all patients by an average of 6.1%. In nine of the 11 studies, however, cardiac output fell by 15% to 30% after the second increment. On the two other occasions cardiac output and oxygen delivery rose by up to 54%. Positive end expiratory pressure was decreased on seven occasions; there was considerable individual variation in the time taken for cardiac output to rise and arterial oxygen saturation to fall. In six patients good agreement was seen between the results from Doppler ultrasonography and thermodilution, the mean of the differences being -0.3% with narrow limits of agreement (-14.4% to 13.9%). CONCLUSIONS--Oesophageal Doppler ultrasonography is a rapid, safe, and reliable technique for optimising positive end expiratory pressure to obtain maximal delivery of oxygen to tissues. The results show the need to consider haemodynamic consequences when altering positive end expiratory pressure.\r"

DESIGN--Randomised double blind controlled trial of oral rehydration solution containing L-alanine and glucose. SETTING--Inpatient service of a hospital treating diarrhoea. PATIENTS--97 Male patients aged 6-59 years admitted to the hospital with acute and severe dehydration due to diarrhoea associated with Vibrio cholerae or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. Forty nine received the standard glucose based oral rehydration solution (control group) and 48 this solution with alanine added (study group). INTERVENTIONS--All of the patients received rapid intravenous acetate solution for the initial four hours after admission, which fully corrected the signs of dehydration. They were then admitted to the study and randomised. Immediately after the intravenous treatment oral rehydration treatment was started. All of the patients received oral tetracycline for 48 hours, starting 24 hours after start of the study. If signs of dehydration reappeared during oral treatment patients were given rapid intravenous acetate solution until they were fully corrected and then continued to take the assigned oral rehydration solution. END POINT--Passage of the last watery stool. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS--The median stool output/kg body weight during the initial 24 hours of oral rehydration treatment and until diarrhoea stopped was reduced in the study group compared with the control group from 309 ml to 196 ml and from 393 ml to 236 ml respectively. Intake of oral rehydration solution and intravenous acetate solution was reduced from 455 ml to 308 ml and from 616 ml to 425 ml respectively. Two patients in the study group compared with 18 patients in the control group required unscheduled rapid intravenous acetate solution to correct signs of dehydration during oral rehydration treatment. CONCLUSION--Oral rehydration solution containing L-alanine was considerably better than standard oral rehydration solution at reducing the severity of symptoms and the need for fluid of male patients with diarrhoea associated with V cholerae and enterotoxigenic E coli.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the extent of three year follow up of blood pressure, weight, and smoking habit in patients with raised blood pressure identified at health checks. DESIGN--Retrospective audit of medical and nursing records. SETTING--Three general practices in Oxfordshire. PATIENTS--386 of 448 patients with raised blood pressure (diastolic greater than or equal to 90 or systolic greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg) identified from 2935 patients aged 35-64 attending health checks in 1982-4. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS--All records of blood pressure, weight, and smoking habit in the medical record were abstracted for three years after the initial health check. All 42 patients with an initial diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 105 mm Hg and 316 of 344 patients with an initial pressure of 90-104 mm Hg had at least one further measurement of their blood pressure. Follow up of smoking habit and of weight was less complete with only half of the 100 smokers and 67 of the 87 obese patients (body mass index greater than or equal to 30) having any documented follow up of these risk factors. Annual follow up in the second and third years occurred in 228/297 (76.8%) and 232/320 (72.5%) in patients with blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg at the beginning of each year. For patients who smoked annual follow up in these years occurred in fewer than a third and for those who were obese in just over half. On the assumption that those not followed up had not changed, at the end of three years the proportion of patients with diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg had fallen from 61 patients (15.8%) to 31 (8.1%); the proportion of smokers had fallen from 103 (26.7%) to 94 (24.4%); and the proportion of obese patients had fallen from 87 (22.5%) to 79 (20.5%). CONCLUSIONS--These changes were modest and in the absence of a control group cannot be attributed necessarily to health checks. Although the standard of follow up was better than in previously reported studies of the management of hypertension, the results emphasise the need to develop formal protocols for dietary and antismoking interventions and to evaluate formally the effectiveness (and cost effectiveness) of health checks.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the value of antenatal diagnosis of abnormalities of the urinary tract on ultrasonography. DESIGN--Retrospective study. SETTING--Two obstetric units in Glasgow. SUBJECTS--62 Fetuses in which renal abnormalities were diagnosed on antenatal ultrasonography. INTERVENTIONS--Six fetuses had their bladders aspirated to determine renal function. Fifteen pregnancies were terminated on the basis of the findings on antenatal ultrasonography, and if possible necropsy was performed on the fetuses. In babies who were born alive the final diagnosis was made by postnatal ultrasonography, intravenous urography, radionuclide scanning, cystography, and, in those who died in the early neonatal period, necropsy. Neonates who were referred with a known obstructed kidney had nephrostomy or pyeloplasty. END POINT--Assessment of the value of antenatal diagnosis of renal abnormalities on ultrasonography for babies who had no clinical evidence of disease postnatally. MAIN RESULTS--Eighteen fetuses did not survive birth; the antenatal diagnosis was accurate in all 18. Of the 44 babies born alive, five had normal urinary tracts, in two of whom antenatal ultrasonography had probably indicated a false positive diagnosis. Fourteen babies died during the early neonatal period. Twenty five babies with renal abnormalities were followed up; the antenatal diagnosis was inaccurate for 10 of them, the commonest misdiagnosis being hydronephrosis for multicystic kidney and vice versa, and there was one false positive diagnosis. The initial clinical findings in 14 babies would have led to the early detection of a urological abnormality. In the 30 babies with no clinical evidence of disease the antenatal diagnosis was of definite value in eight, probable value in 15, and marginal value in seven. Overall, an accurate antenatal diagnosis was made in 46 of the 62 cases (74%); in 12 cases renal disease was detected but its specific nature was not determined; and in four cases the diagnosis was misleading. CONCLUSIONS--The overall value of antenatal diagnosis is that it indicates early termination of fetuses with fatal renal disease, prepares parents and medical staff for the likelihood of serious neonatal problems, and shows abnormalities of the urinary tract that may not be detected postnatally.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the morbidity and mortality associated with a prenatal diagnosis of bilateral fetal uropathy. DESIGN--Retrospective study. SETTING--Departments of radiology, paediatric surgery, obstetrics, and pathology in two teaching hospitals that serve as referral centres for the Yorkshire region. PATIENTS--126 Cases of fetal uropathy were referred either prenatally or postnatally from hospitals in Yorkshire between August 1982 and December 1987. The disease was bilateral in 54 cases and unilateral in 72 cases. In 14 cases bilateral fetal uropathy was associated with coexistent disease. INTERVENTIONS--All cases were managed individually by an obstetrician after discussion with the radiologists and paediatric surgeons. Babies who survived were treated prophylactically with antibiotics after delivery and were operated on if appropriate. END POINT--Assessment of prognosis for long term renal function for each baby referred between August 1982 and December 1987: follow up ranged from six months to five years. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Of the 54 fetuses with bilateral fetal uropathy, 13 were terminated as the prenatal findings of ultrasonography were considered to be incompatible with long term survival. Ten of the liveborn babies died, five of renal or pulmonary insufficiency, or both, and five of associated congenital anomalies. Thirty one infants survived to follow up; four of these had serious coexistent disease and two had impaired renal function. Thus the overall mortality was 43% and the morbidity rate 19%. The renal anomaly was associated with other serious disease in 14 cases (26%) compared with two (3%) of the 72 cases of unilateral fetal uropathy. All but two of the 27 infants with isolated bilateral urinary tract disease had excellent prospects for survival. CONCLUSION--Although bilateral fetal uropathy is associated with a high morbidity rate and mortality, careful prenatal assessment can help to identify fetuses with a poor prognosis. The outlook for a fetus with isolated renal disease if treated promptly after delivery is excellent and compares favourably with that reported after prenatal surgical intervention.\r"

DESIGN--A 12 month prospective population study. Follow up of infants to between 9 and 18 months. SETTING--A district general hospital. PARTICIPANTS--6292 Pregnant women reaching 28 weeks' gestation within the study period. INTERVENTIONS--Antenatal ultrasound scanning was offered to all of the women. Babies in whom an abnormality of the renal tract had been detected antenatally underwent ultrasound scanning at the end of the first week. If the abnormality was confirmed contrast radiography was performed. END POINT--Confirmation of suspected renal abnormality by postnatal investigations. Detection of abnormality in children thought to be normal antenatally. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Of the 92 babies who had abnormal antenatal scans, 42 had abnormalities confirmed postnatally. Four of them died and 21 had had or were awaiting an operation at 18 months' follow up. Seven children had renal abnormalities that were missed antenatally. The incidence of abnormalities detected by screening antenatally was 0.65%, and the overall incidence at 18 months' follow up was 0.76%. CONCLUSIONS--The incidence of structural renal abnormalities in babies is higher than reported previously. Antenatal ultrasonography is an effective way of detecting such abnormalities.\r"

SETTING--Outpatient and general medicine departments in secondary referral centre. PATIENTS--Of 15 patients aged 17-57 with severe atopic eczema, all with acute exacerbations of disease, 13 were admitted to hospital and two treated as outpatients until the skin lesions had resolved or greatly improved. Nineteen controls gave single blood samples. INTERVENTIONS--Daily skin dressing with betamethasone valerate (0.025%) and ichthammol paste and tubular dressings. END POINT--Resolution of or considerable improvement in skin lesions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to measure serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor concentrations in blood samples taken on admission, at intervals subsequently, and on discharge. Clinical scores of disease activity were also made. Median concentrations on admission were significantly higher (770 U/ml) in the patients than the controls (300 U/ml). Concentrations fell significantly during treatment. In 25 assessments made at different times in 13 patients serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor concentration correlated significantly (R = 0.73) with clinical disease activity. CONCLUSIONS--Cellular immunopathogenic mechanisms contribute to atopic eczema. Immune activation can be measured in atopic eczema by measurements of soluble interleukin 2 receptor, and this should facilitate assessment of response to treatment.\r"

Trainees stated that they received no informal teaching in nearly one third of posts. The orientation of teaching towards general practice was reported as greatest in the posts that were not part of a vocational training scheme. Study leave was applied for by doctors in only 163 (37%) posts, usually to prepare for or to sit an examination. There seem to be serious educational deficiencies in hospital posts that are used to train both general practitioners and other specialists. Improvements in both the quantity and quality of in service teaching are therefore needed urgently.\r"

Among the 175 who had had a post in paediatrics 108 (62%) had been given teaching sessions every week, and for half of these doctors the sessions lasted over one hour a week. Seventy five (54%) of the 139 principals reported that in their training in a general practice they had received no teaching about child health and a fifth said that they had not attended a clinic for children; 47 (34%) had received no training on procedures for dealing with cases of child abuse. The doctors who had held posts as senior house officers in paediatrics were more likely to report that they had adequate skills in paediatrics than those who had not, but overall only 62 (44%) reported that they could run a preschool child health surveillance programme. Extra paediatric posts in hospital are needed, but in the mean time improvements can be made to the teaching content in hospital and in the general practice attachment and postgraduate training in paediatrics provided for all general practitioners.\r"

The clinical findings in 845 survivors seen at or admitted to hospital were compatible with exposure to an asphyxiant gas. Rescuers noted cutaneous erythema and bullae on an unknown proportion of corpses and 161 (19%) survivors treated in hospital; though these lesions were initially believed to be burns from acidic gases, further investigation suggested that they were associated with coma states caused by exposure to carbon dioxide in air. The disaster at Lake Nyos and a similar event at Lake Monoun, Cameroon, two years previously provide new information on the possible medical effects of large scale emissions of carbon dioxide, though the presence of other toxic factors in these gas releases cannot be excluded.\r"

Results obtained with hyaluronic acid, although inconclusive, are similar to those given by chondroitin sulphate. Heparin sodium salt had a powerful inhibitory effect on both the nucleation rate and the suspension density, the effect increasing in proportion to the heparin concentration. SEM examination showed that the octahedral habit of calcium oxalate dihydrate was modified by the addition of heparin sodium salt and confirmed that the average crystal size in the presence of chondroitin sulphate and hyaluronic acid was significantly greater than the control or that found in the presence of heparin sodium salt.\r"

However, sensitivity to beta-adrenergic agonists with respect to maximum diastolic potential was identical at both ages, and delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity did occur in response to ouabain. Age-dependent lengthening of the action potential duration and plateau also were seen and were greater in the adult than the young. beta-Adrenergic receptor density and affinity and the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gs) were similar in adult and young tissues. In contrast, the inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gi) was 2.5-fold greater in adult (15 fmol/mg) than in young (6.0 fmol/mg) tissues. Basal- and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were greater in adult than young coronary sinus although the increment in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in young tissue was greater when compared either with basal levels or expressed as a percentage of maximal catalytic activity. Both the traditional effector pathway of beta-adrenergic action, involving the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity, and developmental changes in the action potential plateau may contribute to the developmental changes in delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity.\r"

We evaluated left ventricular regional wall motion by the centerline chord method in 332 patients treated with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in the multicenter Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) I trial. All patients had acute contrast ventriculograms of suitable quality for analysis, and 266 patients had paired acute and day 7 ventriculograms. Enhanced function of the noninfarct zone was present during acute catheterization (+0.3 SD/chord) and was associated with preservation of the acute ejection fraction (p = 0.0001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed the most powerful clinical factor associated with enhanced function of the noninfarct zone was the absence of multivessel disease (p = 0.0001). Clinical factors that were related weakly to noninfarct zone function included female gender (p = 0.08) and higher flow in the infarct artery (p = 0.03). Neither the degree of infarct zone dysfunction nor infarct location was associated with hyperkinesis of the noninfarct zone. In hospital, mortality was closely related to function in the noninfarct zone (p = 0.006), ejection fraction (p = 0.025), and the number of diseased vessels (p = 0.009) but was not related to infarct zone function (p = 0.128).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At rest, nitroglycerin decreased mitral regurgitant volume from 18 +/- 13 to 11 +/- 11 ml (p less than 0.05), while forward stroke volume, by both thermodilution and Doppler echocardiography, substantially increased. Similarly, during isometric exercise, nitroglycerin decreased mitral regurgitant volume from 31 +/- 17 to 20 +/- 14 ml (p less than 0.05), while significantly increasing forward stroke volume. At control rest, the median mitral regurgitant fraction was 24% for the 12 patients. Neither dobutamine nor nitroglycerin changed significantly forward stroke and mitral regurgitant volumes at rest and during isometric exercise in the six patients with resting mitral regurgitant fraction below the median. In contrast, dobutamine and nitroglycerin significantly decreased mitral regurgitant volume and increased forward stroke volume both at rest and during isometric exercise in the six patients with mitral regurgitant fraction greater than the median.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of ventricular fibrillation is poorly understood at the cellular level. We explored the role of intracellular free calcium in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of ventricular fibrillation in perfused ferret hearts loaded with the Ca2+ indicator 5F-BAPTA. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure [Ca2+]i, pH, and high-energy phosphates. During ventricular fibrillation induced by burst pacing, [Ca2+]i rose rapidly and dramatically, exceeding by four times the control within 5 minutes. [Ca2+]i remained markedly elevated throughout 20 minutes of fibrillation, but it returned to control values shortly after defibrillation. In a group of hearts kept isovolumic by a balloon in the left ventricle, acidosis and high-energy phosphate depletion developed despite the maintenance of normal coronary pressure. To distinguish the effects of superimposed ischemia from those of the arrhythmia itself, we lowered left ventricular volume during fibrillation in a second group of hearts. This maneuver decreased wall stress such that fibrillation had no significant adverse effect on intracellular pH, high-energy phosphates, or lactate efflux. [Ca2+]i still increased remarkably despite the absence of ischemic changes. Developed pressure did not recover to control levels after defibrillation in either group; the hearts appeared \"stunned.\" We conclude that intracellular calcium increases as a direct consequence of ventricular fibrillation. The increase in [Ca2+]i may cause the contractile dysfunction observed in postarrhythmic hearts. Its possible role in initiating or maintaining the arrhythmia is less clear.\r"

  ".U": "89324344\r", 
  ".W": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is characterized by stimulation of ventricular synthesis of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the increased ventricular ANP levels participate in the release of ANP into the circulation. Swimming was used as a physiologic model to induce ANP release from the heart, and atrial and ventricular levels of immunoreactive ANP (IR-ANP) and ANP messenger RNA (mRNA) were measured simultaneously in the spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats at rest and after swimming. IR-ANP concentration in the left ventricle of 1-year-old SHR with severe left ventricular hypertrophy was increased in association with the augmentation of ANP mRNA levels, whereas right ventricular levels of ANP were reduced in SHR compared with normotensive controls. A 30-minute exercise in hypertensive and in normotensive rats resulted in marked increases in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, plasma catecholamine levels, blood lactate levels, and plasma IR-ANP concentration. The increased ANP secretion was associated with a decrease in left (34-39%) and right (24%) ventricular concentration of IR-ANP; transmurally, this depletion of ventricular IR-ANP was greatest (28%) in the endocardial layer of the left ventricle of SHR. No significant differences were noted in total atrial and left or right auricular IR-ANP concentration between SHR and WKY rats or between the resting and swimming rats. When studied in vitro with an isolated, perfused heart preparation, the hypertrophic ventricular tissue after atrialectomy secreted more ANP into the perfusate than did control hearts; in SHR, ventricles contributed 28% of the total ANP release to perfusate, and in normotensive control rats, ventricles contributed 8%. These studies show that stimulated release of ANP is associated with depletion of endocardial left ventricular stores. The amount of ANP released in vitro and in vivo correlated with the degree of hypertrophy of the ventricle. Finally, the phorbol ester, known to increase ANP secretion from intact perfused hearts, had only a limited effect on ANP release after atrialectomy, suggesting that the secretion of ANP from ventricular cells may be mainly of the constitutive type.\r"

Virtually all organ systems can be involved, either directly or through neural or vascular influences. Children and adults may be affected; management may become difficult due to mental retardation, learning and behavior disorders, and seizures. Because the condition is inherited in autosomal-dominant fashion, one may have to deal with family members who also have these medical, neurologic, and psychologic problems. Benign or malignant tumors may be found in the brain, spinal cord, and somatic and autonomic peripheral nerves. Malignant tumors may involve the airway, the gastrointestinal tract, the genitourinary tract, and the blood vessels. Clinicians caring for these patients must be aware of these protean manifestations in addition to problems involving their own areas of expertise.\r"

An average of 3.9 units of intraoperative blood was salvaged, using a semicontinuous system; 6.5 units were salvaged in patients requiring segmental grafting of the acetabulum and femur. Patients not requiring segmental grafting had only 2.1 units salvaged. The use of homologous banked blood in patients without stored autologous units available was almost three times that of patients with autologous blood. Autotransfusion in the form of autologous transfusions and intraoperative blood salvage accounted for 72% of the total blood requirements. The cell saver is most cost-effective in patients with femur and acetabular bone loss requiring segmental grafting. An autologous transfusion program is important in all patients in whom blood transfusions are expected.\r"

This study reviewed the long-term results of treatment to determine if skeletal maturity could be considered the definitive end point of treatment or if the results deteriorate past skeletal maturity. In addition, the effect of neurofibromatosis on pseudarthrosis of the tibia is analyzed. Forty-one patients were reviewed. Only 25 had sufficient follow-up data to be included in this study. Eighteen of the 25 had neurofibromatosis. The results were classified according to criteria developed by Morrissy et al. At skeletal maturity, there were ten good results, three fair results, and three poor results, with nine patients having had amputation. At long-term follow-up evaluation (average 36 years; range five to 62 years), one patient with a fair result had elected amputation. About one half of the patients with neurofibromatosis required amputation. This study suggests that the results at skeletal maturity are reliable indicators of long-term results.\r"

The repair of a ruptured deltoid ligament was not necessary. An increased rigidity of the ankle mortise was found 18 months after injury.

Pathologic bone formation can be categorized into three groups based on the initiating stimulus: trauma, tumors, and idiopathic causes. In the trauma category, the formation of ectopic bone is concerned with major and minor traumatic incidents, surgery, burns, and other causes. In the tumor category, direct and reactive pathologic bone formation is discussed with an emphasis on the different neoplasms capable of ectopic bone formation. The category of idiopathic causes involves the formation of pathologic bone following neurologic injury and in systemic ossification disorders. The origin of the bone-forming cells in all forms of pathologic bone has not been unequivocally determined. However, there is evidence suggesting that these cells may arise from osteogenic stromal elements. Potent bone formation growth-regulating factors have been recently identified, and these molecules must also participate in the formation of pathologic bone. Increased understanding of the processes that control pathologic bone formation will lead to better methods of preventing and treating disorders of ossification.\r"

  ".W": "A study of 116 patients younger than 12 years of age conclusively diagnosed as having neurofibromatosis was undertaken to determine the incidence of significant orthopedic problems. Deformities of the spine comprised the most common skeletal problem. Seventy-four patients (64%) had spinal deformities. Forty-six patients were treated by posterior spinal fusion. Ten required exploration for pseudarthrosis; six were found to have pseudarthrotic defects in the fusion mass. Eight patients had more kyphosis than scoliosis. Only three patients with kyphoscoliosis obtained a solid posterior spinal fusion after multiple surgical procedures. Anteroposterior and lateral roentgenograms of the cervical spine are recommended at the time of initial evaluation of all spinal deformities. Four patients had severe cervical spine deformities, only one of whom was initially identified as having a cervical spine disorder while under treatment for scoliosis. Three of these patients were seen by other surgical services for neck masses. Following removal of posterior elements, the osseous structures were unstable. Only one patient developed spondylolisthesis. Because of the exceedingly high incidence of pseudarthrosis and spinal instability following attempts at spinal fusion, certain guidelines have evolved for the management of these deformities. High-volume computed tomographic myelography in the prone, lateral, and supine positions or magnetic resonance imaging should be performed on all patients prior to surgical treatment. Anterior disc excision and bone graft followed by posterior arthrodesis with instrumentation are indicated if the kyphotic angle is greater than 50 degrees or if scoliosis is greater than 80 degrees. Even combined anterior and posterior arthrodesis operations did not guarantee successful permanent spinal stability in young patients with neurofibromatosis.\r"

Three patients had some resorption of the HO, and one had nearly complete resorption. Five patients (3.3%) with HO had no other etiologic agent other than the neurologic insult, and their average age at time of injury was 13 and one-half years. The hip was involved in six of seven instances. The average time to diagnose this HO was 14 months after injury. Ten patients had late concurrent etiologic factors such as surgery, decubitus ulcers, late neurogenic hip dislocation, and late acute local trauma influencing HO formation. Pediatric patients who developed HO appeared to have a lower incidence, delayed onset, and fewer associated signs and symptoms compared with their adult counterparts with spinal cord injury. Patterns of ossification about the hip differ from adults. The HO lesion has the potential to resorb. HO may be initiated years after the spinal injury by an incidental insult.\r"

This study aimed to relate changes in coagulation, fibrinolysis, and kallikrein to shock and outcome. Of 53 patients with severe infection, 30 did not develop shock, 12 survived septic shock, and 11 died from organ failure after septic shock. No patient had overt disseminated intravascular coagulation. We measured 17 components of the coagulation/fibrinolysis/kallikrein pathways on admission and on the next 2 days. High values for fibrinogen, factor VIII:C, von Willebrand factor antigen, and D-dimer were seen in all patients; factor XII, prekallikrein, factor VII, antithrombin, protein C, and fibronectin were low. The patients thus appeared to be hypercoagulable. These disturbances were more pronounced in septic shock survivors, who also had low plasminogen and antiplasmin, indicating ongoing fibrinolysis. Nonsurvivors of sepsis were distinguished mainly by high plasminogen activator inhibitor values; this suggests an impaired functional fibrinolysis in fatal sepsis, with possible therapeutic implications. Cryoprecipitate infusion increased the fibronectin concentration, but did not influence the other factors studied.\r"

Clinicians often use visceral protein levels to assess efficacy of nutritional support. The purpose of this study was to test the validity of such practices. Visceral protein levels were determined in patients in a medical ICU, head injury unit, and burn unit. The serum albumin and thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA) levels correlated significantly with mortality in the medical ICU patients. Burn patients had depressed albumin and TBPA concentrations over the duration of hospitalization that related to the severity of thermal injury but not to adequacy of nutritional support. Head-injured patients had depressed admission albumin and TBPA levels, with neither protein level adequately related to caloric or protein supplementation. We conclude that visceral proteins may reflect severity of injury and prognosis in critically ill hospitalized patients, but they often do not accurately reflect nutritional status or adequacy of nutritional support.\r"

Proteolytic enzymes may be involved in this microvascular injury. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that pretreatment with methylprednisolone prevents activation of proteolytic systems after pulmonary trauma and that these systems are of etiological importance in the development of the pulmonary lesion. Central markers of proteolytic cascade systems were monitored in sheep subjected to local trauma to the lungs (lung lymph fistula preparation) with (n = 7) or without (n = 7) methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) pretreatment. In control animals, reduced levels of prothrombin, antithrombin, kallikrein inhibitors, antiplasmin, and increased level of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) indicated systemic activation of the coagulation, kallikrein-kinin, and fibrinolytic systems. These changes, except for PAI, were more pronounced in lung lymph. High levels of thromboxane A2 and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha were found in lymph. In steroid-pretreated animals, the prostanoid response was attenuated, but all other variables were similar to control animals; thus, steroids did not prevent either local or systemic proteolytic enzyme activation caused by local trauma to the lung. The etiological role of this activation in the development of lung lesion has not yet been evaluated.\r"

Adult male rats were given Silastic implants containing testosterone in lengths ranging from 0.5-20 cm, and their effects on daily sperm production (DSP); serum FSH, LH, and testosterone; and interstitial fluid testosterone were determined in intact and hypophysectomized rats over a 13-week period. In intact rats, DSP levels were suppressed to 4-30% of control values at lower testosterone doses (2- to 6-cm implants), while DSP levels were partially maintained (65-93%) at higher doses (greater than or equal to 8 cm implants). Under these conditions LH levels were suppressed while FSH levels were reduced to 30-60% of control values. A steep testosterone-induced change in DSP levels was observed in both intact (2- to 3-fold) and hypophysectomized (18-fold) animals over a narrow testosterone dose range (implant lengths, 6-8 cm). Interstitial fluid testosterone levels associated with this change in DSP levels range from 6-8% of control values, while serum testosterone levels were elevated 1- to 2-fold above control values. A comparison of the testosterone implant lengths that caused a 50% change in DSP levels after 7 weeks of treatment was similar in intact and hypophysectomized rats. At high testosterone doses (greater than or equal to 10-cm implants), maximal DSP levels decreased 10% by 7 weeks and 35% by 13 weeks. DSP and serum testosterone levels were highly correlated (r = 0.54-0.83), while DSP and interstitial fluid testosterone showed a less correlation (r = 0.36-0.70) under the various experimental conditions examined. In conclusion, the testosterone-induced maintenance of DSP in rats is associated with several dose-related responses or events that appear to be differentially regulated. At low testosterone concentrations, DSP levels are partially maintained in intact rats but are totally suppressed in hypophysectomised rats, suggesting that a pituitary factor, probably FSH, has a potentiating effect at these testosterone concentrations. At intermediate testosterone doses resulting in the testosterone-induced maintenance of DSP, the similarity of dose-response curves (ED50 and maximum response) in intact and hypophysectomised rats would suggest that pituitary hormones are not required for this aspect of the process. The observation that the maintenance of DSP by testosterone under some experimental conditions is poorly correlated with interstitial fluid testosterone levels raises questions as to the mechanisms by which testosterone acts to stimulate spermatogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to explore the effects of LHRH and its agonists on immune system function. As a first step, to identify a putative site of action, the very potent and stable LHRH agonist (LHRH-A), [D-Ser(TBU6)] des-Gly10-LHRH ethylamide (buserelin), was used as an iodinated ligand to characterize LHRH receptors in a membrane preparation of rat thymus, a key organ of the immune system. The effects of LHRH and LHRH-A were then investigated on the proliferative capacity of rat thymocytes exposed in vitro to a mitogen and on ornithine decarboxylase specific activity. In addition, to determine whether LHRH-A treatment in vivo might directly influence thymic function, we treated hypophysectomized (hypox) rats with a moderately high dose of LHRH-A for a period of 2 weeks, and thymocyte mitogenic capacity, thymus weight, and the histological and functional appearance of the thymus were then assessed. Specific binding of LHRH-A to rat thymic membrane preparations is a saturable process, depending on both time and temperature of incubation, but differs markedly from binding to the rat pituitary or ovarian LHRH receptor in its low binding affinity. Binding is optimal in the absence of chelating agents (EDTA) or divalent metal ions, and increases linearly with increasing protein concentration. Binding is specific for LHRH, LHRH-A, and antagonists. Both the C-terminal amide and N-terminal regions of the LHRH molecule were required for binding, and amino acid substitutions at position 6 markedly enhanced and at position 8 markedly reduced binding potencies in rat thymic tissue. A number of peptides, proteins, and other agents had no effect on the specific binding of LHRH-A to thymic membrane preparations. The binding affinity (Ka) of the membrane receptor of the rat thymus for the LHRH superagonist buserelin was 8.4 x 10(8) M-1, while a higher binding affinity (Ka = 2.8 x 10(9) M-1) was calculated for the ovarian LHRH-binding site. Preincubation of rat thymocytes with LHRH-A for 20 h induced a significant dose-dependent increase in the proliferative response to the mitogen Concanavalin-A, monitored by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Using native LHRH, it was also possible to elicit stimulatory effects on the same parameter, although much higher concentrations were required than with LHRH-A. Furthermore, simultaneous addition of a LHRH antagonist, abolished the LHRH effect on thymocytes. Ornithine decarboxylase specific activity under lectin stimulation was also significantly increased by LHRH-A in cultures of rat thymocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The presence of specific LHRH-binding sites within the rat thymus gland and the ability of LHRH and its agonistic and antagonistic analogs to directly modulate thymus function prompted us to study the possible changes in the number of thymic LHRH-binding sites during aging-induced physiological immunosenescence. Moreover, the effects of chronic treatment of aging rats with a potent LHRH agonist (LHRH-A) on thymic LHRH receptors, thymus weight and histology, as well as thymocyte proliferative capacity were assessed. For comparison, the effects of castration on the same parameters was also investigated. The process of aging is accompanied by a sharp reduction in LHRH-A-binding sites within the thymus gland of both female and male rats. Starting at 7 months of age, a 50% decrease in thymic LHRH-A binding was followed, at 11-13 months of age, by a nearly 65% inhibition of receptor numbers. In 16- to 19-month-old rats, LHRH-A binding was almost completely lost. Thymus weight was 30% reduced in 7-month-old animals, while a 50% reduction in thymic size was reached at 11 months of age in males and 13 months in female rats. A further decrease in thymic mass was observed at 16 and 19 months. Chronic (45-day) treatment of aging (15-16 months old) female and male rates with the potent LHRH-A, [D-Trp6,Des-Gly10]LHRH-N-ethylamide, reversed the age-related decreases in both thymus weight and thymic LHRH-binding sites. Similarly, surgical removal of testicular hormones by castration restored thymus weight and increased LHRH-A binding in the thymus of aged rats. While thymus histology in 3-month-old rats was characterized by a clear demarcation of cortical and medullary regions, only thymic remnants were present in 16- to 17-month-old animals. Castration of old rats resulted in a partial restoration of thymic structure, while chronic treatment of aging rats with the LHRH-A produced a homogeneous organization of both cortical and medullary compartments accompanied by a marked increase in the width of the cortical layer, densely packed with lymphocytes. While the process of aging was accompanied by an almost complete loss of the proliferative response of thymocytes to optimal concentrations of the mitogen Concanavalin-A, thymocyte cultures from old rats treated with LHRH-A or from castrated animals, displayed significantly greater proliferative responses. Furthermore, the combination of both manipulations resulted in a further significant increase in thymocyte proliferative capacity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Here we examined the effects of PAF on the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in vivo and in vitro. PAF injected iv to rats (125, 250, and 500 ng/100 g BW) caused significant stimulation of pituitary ACTH and adrenal corticosterone secretion. The peak of PAF effect was recorded 10 min after the injection. Intraperitoneal injection of the PAF receptor antagonist BN 52021 prevented the ACTH-releasing effect of PAF. In explanted rat hypothalami maintained viable in vitro, PAF stimulated immunoreactive CRH secretion in a bell-shaped dose-response fashion. The maximal stimulatory effect occurred at the concentration of 10 nM. Higher concentrations appeared to cause desensitization. Alprazolam (1 microM) and BN 52021 (1 microM), two structurally different PAF receptor antagonists, inhibited this effect. The inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism, indomethacin, eicosatetraynoic acid, and the calcium channel blocker verapamil, inhibited PAF-stimulated CRH secretion, suggesting mediation by Ca2+ influx and phospholipase-A2 activation. In addition, we found that 1 nM PAF weakly stimulated ACTH secretion by dispersed rat pituicytes. This stimulatory effect of PAF was also inhibited by the receptor antagonists alprazolam and BN 52021. Our data suggest that PAF plays a role in the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and glucocorticoid secretion and can perhaps serve as a mediator in the interactions of the immune system with the central nervous system.\r"

In the female, the pulses are irregular and more frequent, with lower amplitudes, while basal secretion is higher. The present study was designed to exclude the indirect effects of sex steroids on the pituitary, enabling investigation of the direct effects of sex steroids on the pituitary. Rats were gonadectomized at 22 days of age, and 12 days later their anterior pituitaries were trypsinized for cell dispersion. Testosterone (T) or 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 5 nM, was added to the medium for 6 days, and subsequently, GRF or somatostatin was added for 4 h. In a perifusion system, the male-derived cell response to GRF was augmented after pretreatment with T, but not with E2. The female-derived cell response to GRF was augmented by E2, but not by T. T increased the sensitivity of the cells to GRF from 3.0-0.03 nM and increased the maximal potency of GH secretion 3-fold. E2 had no significant effect on the sensitivity, but lowered the potency. Somatostatin (1 nM) inhibited GH secretion by 44% in T-treated cells. In E2-treated cells, somatostatin was ineffective. GRF increased the total amount of GH (medium plus cells) in both T- and E2-treated cells, but not in control pituitary cells. It is suggested that T has direct effects on the male somatotroph. By increasing the pituitary cell responses to GRF and somatostatin, T contributes to the high amplitude peak/low baseline pattern of the male. By decreasing the pituitary cell responses to GRF and somatostatin, E2 contributes to the low amplitude peak/high baseline pattern of the female.\r"

In the present study we administered inhibin-rich charcoal-treated porcine follicular fluid (pff) as a bolus to eight chronically catheterized ovine fetuses between 116 and 128 days gestation. FSH levels decreased significantly to 81.3 +/- 4.0% of baseline values after 210 min and decreased further to 71.7 +/- 4.0% throughout the sampling period (5 h). LH levels were not affected by this treatment. An estimate of the secretion rate by integration of the response curve showed a significant decrease in the concentration of plasma ovine (o) FSH after pff compared with saline injection (-28.5 +/- 10.9 U after pff vs. +19.7 +/- 8.8 U after saline; P less than 0.01), while oLH secretion remained unaltered (116.6 +/- 102.1 U after pff vs. 174.5 +/- 99.4 U after saline; P = NS). These data show that in the late gestation ovine fetus pituitary secretion of oFSH, but not oLH, is selectively decreased by inhibin-rich pff, recognizing that the net FSH-suppressing activity of pff is the sum of the actions of FSH-stimulating (e.g. activin) and -suppressing (inhibin and follistatins) factors. Thus, the inhibin-FSH feedback mechanism is potentially functional at least by 0.8d gestational age, raising the possibility of a role for inhibin in the decline of circulating fetal FSH toward term.\r"

This decline in prostatic TRH levels with aging may be a significant factor in benign prostatic hypertrophy in man and other animals. Because prostatic TRH correlates positively with serum testosterone and negatively with serum thyroid hormone levels, we have examined the possibility that the age-related decline in prostatic TRH is hormonally regulated. TRH and a TRH precursor peptide, TRH-Gly (pGlu-His-Pro-Gly), were measured in ventral prostates from 2-, 5-, and 18-month-old Fisher 344 male rats using a combination of HPLC and specific RIAs for TRH and TRH-Gly. Similar measurements were made in a group of 2-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats which were castrated, sham castrated, or left untreated for 3 or 7 days before death. Aging and castration resulted in a significant decrease in the absolute TRH concentration as well as the TRH/TRH-Gly ratio, but no significant change was observed in TRH-Gly levels. The serum testosterone concentration did not change with aging, but serum T4 levels fell significantly. Because testosterone levels do not change during the first 18 months of life in most rat strains, and hypothyroidism in young animals is associated with a significant increase in prostate TRH and TRH-Gly levels, we conclude that the aging-related decline in prostate TRH biosynthesis is not the result of a hypogonadal state.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the role of Ca2+ and calmodulin in the stimulation of cGMP formation by mouse Leydig cells in response to rat atriopeptin-II (rAP-II). Removal of extracellular Ca2+ had no influence on the levels of cGMP accumulated by the cells stimulated with rAP-II. The amounts of testosterone produced by unstimulated and rAP-II-stimulated cells were, however, reduced by 50% in the absence of Ca2+ from the incubation medium. Addition of ionomycin to the Leydig cells led to a dose-related inhibition of rAP-II-stimulated cGMP formation, but the basal cGMP level was not affected. These experiments were carried out in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The inhibitory effect of ionomycin was absolutely dependent upon the presence of Ca2+ in the medium. The guanylate cyclase activity required the presence of a cation, and Mn2+, Mg2+, or Ca2+ could function as the required cation. There was no direct inhibition of the cyclase activity by Ca2+ up to as high a concentration as 8 mM. Furthermore, three structurally unrelated calmodulin antagonists, W7, trifluoperazine, and calmidazolium, but not W5, caused a dose-related inhibition of rAP-II-stimulated cGMP accumulation by the cells. The inhibitory effect of calmodulin antagonists was not exerted directly at the level of guanylate cyclase activity, since the particulate enzyme was not inhibited by any of these drugs. We conclude, therefore, that extracellular Ca2+ is not essential for rAP-II-mediated stimulation of cGMP formation by mouse Leydig cells, at least under the short term incubation conditions used. An excessive ionophoretic influx of Ca2+ into the cells impairs the ability of rAP-II to stimulate cGMP formation. Therefore, it appears that a finely regulated level of intracellular Ca2+ is required for optimal activation of atrial natriuretic peptide-responsive guanylate cyclase in mouse Leydig cells, and calmodulin plays an important role in this process.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the regulation of inhibin secretion by rat Sertoli cells grown on extracellular matrix-impregnated porous filters in a twin chamber assembly. Previous studies have established that rat Sertoli cells cultured under these conditions reproduce the morphological and functional polarization observed in the Sertoli cell in situ. Sertoli cells isolated from 18- to 22-day-old Wistar rats were cultured for up to 8 days with daily changes of fully defined supplemented Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (MEM). Rat inhibin was measured by RIA and pituitary cell bioassay, and transferrin by RIA. Inhibin measured by immunoassay or bioassay was always readily detectable in the upper, but not the lower, chamber. Inhibin secretion into the upper chamber exhibited a dose-dependent stimulation of up to 3.7-fold by ovine FSH, with a medium effective dose of 2.2 micrograms/liter and a constant bio- to immunoreactive ratio (3.6 +/- 0.4). Apically directed secretion accounted for over 80% of inhibit output under basal conditions and over 94% with FSH stimulation. Insulin also stimulated upper chamber inhibin secretion at a high dose (5 mg/liter) but not at lower doses or in conjunction with FSH exposure of Sertoli cells. Testosterone augmented FSH-induced stimulation of inhibin secretion, but was ineffective without FSH exposure. In contrast to inhibin secretion, for which FSH is the principal regulator, transferrin secretion by Sertoli cells is more evenly bidirectional (overall mean upper to lower chamber ratio of 1.5) and requires exposure to other stimuli (insulin, retinoic acid, and testosterone) in addition to FSH to achieve maximal secretion. Both submaximal and maximal FSH stimulation of inhibin output were augmented by a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, isobutylmethylxanthine, and these effects were fully reproduced by forskolin, which suggests the involvement of cAMP in the vectorial secretion of inhibin. The marked polarization of Sertoli cell inhibin secretion in vitro could not be explained by restricted transmembrane passage of inhibin. It is, therefore, suggested that the bulk of inhibin secretion by the immature rat Sertoli cell in vivo may be directed primarily into the seminiferous tubular lumen. Thus, in addition to its role in endocrine negative feedback signaling to the pituitary, inhibin may also have important functions in seminiferous tubular function and the support of spermatogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The posterior pituitary contains a PRL-releasing factor (PRF), a small (less than 5000 mol wt) peptide which is distinct from known PRL secretagogues. The objectives of this study were to determine if posterior pituitary extracts specifically stimulate PRL release in vivo and to assess the relative contributions of oxytocin (OT), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and beta-endorphin (beta END) to the PRF activity of the extract. Rat posterior pituitaries or cerebellar tissue were extracted with 1.0 N acetic acid, boiled, and ultrafiltered through 5000 mol wt cutoff membranes. The eluates were treated with performic acid (which oxidizes disulfide bonds and methionine residues), lyophilized, and reconstituted in saline. Jugular blood was collected from conscious ovariectomized rats before and after intracarotid injection of test substances and was analyzed for PRL, LH, and GH by RIA. Injection of 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0, posterior pituitary equivalents increased plasma PRL levels by 2-, 8-, and 22-fold, respectively. PRL levels peaked within 5 min after the injection and returned to basal levels by 30 min. Plasma LH levels decreased slightly, and GH was unchanged. Cerebellar extracts did not affect plasma hormone levels. Injection of OT induced a 4-fold rise in plasma PRL levels. Oxidation of OT was well as AVP with performic acid abolished any PRL-releasing activity. Injection of beta END increased plasma PRL levels by 7-fold. Treatment of beta END with performic acid caused a 60% loss in its ability to release PRL. Pretreatment of rats with naloxone abolished the PRL-releasing effect of beta END, but did not alter the PRF activity of posterior pituitary extracts. We conclude that posterior pituitary extracts stimulate PRL release in vivo in the presence of an intact dopaminergic inhibition. This stimulation is rapid, dose dependent, and hormone specific. OT, AVP, and beta END do not contribute significantly to the PRF activity in the posterior pituitary extract.\r"

In the pituitary, using double immunofluorescent staining, GRH-IR was found in some, but not all, somatotrophs, gonadotrophs, thyrotrophs, and mammotrophs. GRH-IR was found in both pancreatic exocrine cells and endocrine islets. Within the islet, GRH-IR was colocalized in A and D cells with glucagon and somatostatin, respectively. Immunopositive cells in other tissues were localized in kidney proximal convoluted tubules, duodenal submucosal glands of Brunner, the smooth muscles of pulmonary arterioles, testicular Leydig cells, oocytes, adrenal medullary chromaffin cells, and cardiac atria. In the brain, GRH-IR was seen in the external layer of the median eminence and in perikarya and fibers of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, the parvocellular region of the paraventricular nucleus, the supraoptic nucleus, and the amygdala. Somatostatin-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers in transgenic and control mouse hypothalamus were not appreciably different. In summary, hGRH expression in transgenic mice occurs in a cell-specific manner in the hypothalamus as well as in numerous other tissues, many of which have secretory functions.\r"

Sham-operated control and ovariectomized (OVX) rats were treated intermittently with vehicle alone, estrogen, or the diphosphonate compounds etidronate disodium (EHDP) and NE-58095 [2-(3-pyridinyl)2-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate disodium] for 35 or 70 days after surgery. Their proximal tibiae were processed undecalcified for quantitative bone histomorphometry. Vehicle-treated OVX rats were characterized by decreased cancellous bone volume and 3- to 4-fold increases in osteoblast surface, osteoclast surface, bone formation rate, and bone resorption rate. Treatment of OVX rats with estrogen and NE-58095 provided complete protection against bone loss and significantly depressed all of the above indices of bone turnover. OVX rats treated with EHDP exhibited at least partial protection against bone loss and decreased bone turnover. EHDP induced a mild mineralization defect, as indicated by a prolonged mineralization lag time at the tibial endocortical surface. The new diphosphonate compound NE-58095 did not impair bone mineralization. Our results indicate that endocrine and pharmacological suppressors of bone turnover prevent the development of osteopenia during the early stages of estrogen deficiency. If confirmed by clinical trials in humans, diphosphonate compounds may prove to be an alternative to estrogen for the prevention of postmenopausal bone loss.\r"

  ".U": "89325182\r", 
  ".W": "In the female rat, plasma immunoreactive inhibin alpha (irl alpha) levels show marked changes during proestrus and estrus. We investigated the modulating effect of LH and FSH on these changes by injecting the GnRH antagonist DNal-DCpa-DPal-Dpr-(Ac)Dal-Leu-Arg-Pro-Asn-NH2, with or without exogenous LH replacement. Administration of the antagonist at noon on proestrus abolished the primary (proestrus) LH and FSH surge and markedly reduced the secondary (estrus) FSH surge. This treatment also reduced the release of irl alpha normally measured during proestrus afternoon, and partially prevented the decrease in irI alpha secretion on proestrus evening. Exogenous LH injected at 1545 h on proestrus had no measurable effect on irI alpha or FSH levels in control rats; however, in antagonist-treated animals, it restored the secondary FSH surge to control values while augmenting the late proestrus fall in irI alpha. This suggests that the decrease in inhibin secretion measured after exogenous LH treatment represents the mechanism through which LH induced the secondary FSH surge in antagonist-blocked rats. We also used in situ hybridization techniques to examine the changes in the expression of inhibin subunits in the ovary at 0200 h on estrus. The antagonist reduced expression of the alpha-, beta A-, and beta B-subunits in all follicle and tissue types, with the exception of the granulosa cells of large tertiary (possibly preovulatory) follicles where the signal appeared greatly enhanced. These changes were reversed by LH. The alteration in inhibin subunit messages caused by blockade of the primary gonadotropin surge suggests the presence of a cross-regulation between LH and inhibin/activin secretion, so that a decline in circulating LH levels might stimulate inhibin/activin secretion in the granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles, while reducing the production of these proteins in less mature follicles and in other ovarian cell types.\r"

Activity was monitored by using an in vitro granulosa cell bioassay, measuring the effect of the inhibitor on FSH-stimulated estradiol production. The purified polypeptide dose-dependently inhibited production of both estradiol (EC50 = 0.7 nM) and progesterone (EC50 = 1.3 nM) by rat granulosa cells cultured in the presence of 20 ng/ml FSH. N-Terminal sequence analysis revealed a high degree of homology with the 53,000 mol wt human GH-dependent insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGF-BP). Coincubation of stoichiometric amounts of IGF-I or -II and the inhibitor (IGF-BP) resulted in complete neutralization of the inhibitory effect. Since both IGFs are produced locally in the ovary and exert stimulatory effects on granulosa cells, local production of IGF-BP may provide an important means of regulating ovarian follicle growth.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothalamic decapeptide GnRH is known to regulate the synthesis and secretion of LH and FSH by pituitary gonadotrope cells. The frequency of pulsatile GnRH secretion changes and LH and FSH are differentially secreted in various physiological situations. To investigate the potential role of altered frequency of GnRH stimulation in regulating differential secretion of LH and FSH, we examined the effects of GnRH frequency on expression of the alpha, LH beta, and FSH beta genes. GnRH pulses (25 ng/pulse) were administered to castrate testosterone-replaced rats at intervals of 8-480 min to cover the range of physiological pulsatile GnRH secretion. Fast frequency GnRH pulses (8-min pulse intervals) increased alpha-subunit mRNA concentrations 3-fold above those in saline-pulsed controls (controls, 1.01 fmol cDNA bound/100 micrograms pituitary DNA) and LH beta mRNA by 50% (controls, 0.18 fmol cDNA bound), but FSH beta mRNA was unchanged (controls, 0.38 fmol cDNA bound). GnRH pulses given every 30 min increased all three subunit mRNAs (alpha, 3-fold, LHbeta, 2-fold; FSH beta, 2-fold), and acute LH release and serum FSH concentrations were maximal after this frequency. Slower frequency GnRH stimuli (120- to 480-min pulse intervals) did not change alpha and LH beta mRNA levels, but increased FSH beta mRNA 2- to 2.5-fold, and FSH secretion was maintained. Equalization of the total dose of GnRH given at different intervals over 24 h confirmed the frequency dependence of subunit mRNA expression. Fast frequency GnRH stimuli (8 min) increased alpha mRNA 1.5- to 2.5-fold, while the same total GnRH doses were ineffective when given at slow frequency (480 min). Similarly, LH beta mRNA was only increased by GnRH pulses given at 8-min intervals. In contrast, FSH beta mRNA increased 2-fold after pulses given every 480 min, and the 8-min pulse interval was ineffective. The data show that the frequency of GnRH stimulation can differentially regulate gonadotropin subunit mRNA expression and may be a mechanism that enables a single GnRH peptide to selectively regulate gonadotropin subunit gene expression and hormone secretion.\r"

This was preceded by a rapid transient rise in c-myc and c-fos proto-oncogene mRNA levels. Alterations in the medium calcium concentration had no effect on the growth state of quiescent parathyroid cells. In addition, varying the medium calcium concentration did not influence either the time course or the degree of induction of proto-oncogene expression or the subsequent increase in [3H] thymidine uptake or proliferation of stimulated parathyroid cells. In contrast, when 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol was added with serum or serum substitute to quiescent parathyroid cells, no increase in c-myc mRNA levels was observed, and the expected increase in parathyroid cell number failed to occur. The augmentation in c-fos mRNA in response to serum was not, however, altered by 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. These results indicate that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, but not extracellular calcium, may directly modulate parathyroid cell proliferation by altering the expression of specific replication-associated oncogenes.\r"

  ".W": "Unilateral electrical stimulation for 15 min of the paraventricular area of anesthetized rats induced a 2- to 3- fold increase in plasma TSH levels and caused an increased release of TRH into hypophysial stalk blood from 217 +/- 25 to 530 +/- 90 pg/15 min (n = 6). This experimental model was then used to determine the in vivo hypothalamic release of TRH by push-pull perfusion of either the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) or anterior pituitary (AP). Before stimulation, TRH release per 15 min was 4.2 +/- 0.7 pg from the MBH (n = 18) and 3.5 +/- 0.3 pg from the AP (n = 13). Unilateral electrical stimulation of the paraventricular area led to higher plasma TSH levels in 27 of 31 rats, and levels during stimulation increased from 0.89 +/- 0.04 to 1.86 +/- 0.10 ng/ml (n = 31). No significant increase in TRH in the perfusates was observed when push-pull perfusion was done in the MBH contralateral to the site of stimulation (n = 6). However, TRH release increased 2- to 3-fold during the perfusion of the MBH ipsilateral to the site of stimulation (15.4 +/- 4.3 pg/15 min; n = 13). In conclusion, push-pull perfusion of the MBH or AP can be used to estimate hypothalamic TRH release. However, the output of TRH by push-pull perfusion is low and varies considerably between individual rats. Thus, the practical value of push-pull perfusion for measurement of in vivo TRH release seems limited.\r"

The pituitary PRL, LH, and FSH responses to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), and metoclopramide (MC) were also measured before and after CBZ treatment. The baseline serum hormone and SHBG levels were measured and the FAI values calculated in 16 healthy male control subjects of similar age. The mean E2 level was higher in patients before CBZ treatment than in control subjects, and untreated patients had greater variances for FAI values, PRL levels, and LH levels than control subjects. No other significant differences were found between untreated patients and control subjects. The FAI values and DHEAS levels of patients decreased during 2-month treatment with CBZ. The PRL response to MC was higher after CBZ treatment than before. The baseline levels of other hormones and SHBG, as well as the LH and FSH responses to LH-RH, remained unaltered. The results indicate that during the first 2 months of CBZ treatment the androgen balance in male epileptic patients changes: Serum DHEAS levels and FAI values decrease, although FT levels remain unchanged. The clinical relevance of these hormonal changes is obscure.\r"

We prospectively studied the consequences of CZP discontinuation in 40 consecutive children with difficult-to-treat epilepsies and multiple-drug therapy. The CZP was reduced stepwise in a variable daily reduction rate (0.003-0.16 mg/kg), while serum levels of the comedication were kept unchanged. In only three children (7.5%), CZP was believed to have had some antiepileptic effect; in 30 (75%) it had been ineffective, whereas in six (15%), a decrease in seizure frequency after CZP discontinuation even suggested a negative therapeutic effect. Discontinuation symptoms, mostly in the form of a transitory exacerbation of seizure frequency, occurred in 19 children (47.5%). These children had a significantly higher CZP dose and longer duration of treatment than did children without discontinuation symptoms, but there was no difference between the two groups related to the rate of CZP discontinuance.\r"

Ten women with PCOS and ten normal ovulatory controls were randomized to receive a single dose (2 ampules) of either hFSH or hMG. Serum LH decreased significantly following hFSH with responses occurring earlier in controls (24.5 +/- 10.9% after 30 minutes) than in PCOS patients (27.3 +/- 7.5% after 18 hours). After hMG, LH increased only in controls (33.8 +/- 16.3%). An FSH increment following hFSH was observed in both PCOS patients (54.7 +/- 24.8%) and controls (74.6 +/- 36.8%), with peak responses at 6 and 4 hours, respectively. However, after hMG, FSH increased only in controls. The LH/FSH ratio after hFSH decreased, with the nadir at 18 hours (1.438 +/- 0.183) being similar to baseline LH/FSH ratios of controls (1.433 +/- 0.341). Serum estradiol (E2) increased following hMG, with peak responses after 18 hours, in both PCOS patients (75.4 +/- 28.6%) and controls (88.5 +/- 32.5%). The peak E2 response to hFSH was observed to be earlier in PCOS patients (147 +/- 34%), occurring after 12 hours, compared with controls (58 +/- 29% after 18 hours).\r"

  ".W": "The role of estrogens on gonadotropin secretion was assessed in two siblings with incomplete virilization syndrome type I due to partial androgen insensitivity (Reinfenstein's syndrome). Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured before and after 100 micrograms LH-releasing hormone (RH) intravenous (IV) stimulation, as well as during long-term clomiphene citrate (CC) administration. Serum testosterone (T) and estrogens were determined before and during daily administration of human chronic gonadotropin (hCG) and also during the CC treatment. Basal levels of LH were elevated in both patients: 12.5 +/- 1.1 mIU in patient A and 19.8 +/- 1.8 mIU/ml in patient B. Conversely, FSH levels were within normal limits. Administration of LH-RH in both subjects induced a rise in LH levels, while FSH concentration showed no increase. The CC administration resulted in a significant (P less than 0.005) increment in serum LH levels without changes in FSH concentration. An important increase of serum T and estradiol (E2) levels was noted during CC administration; thus, in patient A those levels augmented from 20 to 48 ng/ml for T and from 78 to 220 pg/ml for E2; and patient B showed an increment from 20 to 35 ng/ml for T, and from 55 to 180 pg/ml for E2. The daily administration of hCG was followed by an increment in both T and E2 levels, which was of lesser degree for estrone concentration. These results suggest that endogenous estrogens, particularly E2, modulate LH secretion in patients with partial androgen insensitivity; however, it appears that estrogens had no physiologic effect on FSH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The penetration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a), Buserelin (Hoechst AG, Frankfurt, West Germany), into human follicular fluids (FF) was studied by means of a radioimmunoassay (RIA) and a bioassay. Acute nasal administration of a therapeutic dose of Buserelin (300 and 600 micrograms) before the ovum pickup for in vitro fertilization leads to significant concentrations of Buserelin in one-third of the FF. These concentrations ranged between 28 and 124 pg/ml, which represents 10% to 50% of the serum concentrations achieved in these patients. Follicular penetration of this agonist is time-dependent. Chronic administration during the follicular phase leads to low but significant concentrations of peptide 36 hours after the last inhalation. A very good correlation was observed between the RIA and the bioassay. This demonstrates the accuracy and the specificity of the RIA. In addition, it indicates that the Buserelin that reaches follicles is intact and is not the inactive product of degradation. Intranasal administration of Buserelin stopped 35 hours before ovum pickup appears to be an adequate way of minimizing the exposure of maturing oocytes to the GnRH-a.\r"

Patients treated with the short-Buserelin-gonadotropin regimen had a significantly higher likelihood of achieving pregnancy than patients treated with the standard clomiphene citrate (CC)/hMG regimen (respectively, 35.5% and 18% per treatment cycle). A significantly higher number of eggs were collected after short-Buserelin-gonadotropin treatment than CC/hMG, but the proportion of patients having a given number of embryos replaced was similar in the two groups. The short-Buserelin-gonadotropin-treated patients were distinguished from the CC/hMG-treated group by significantly lower levels of LH in the late follicular phase and a lower plasma level of estradiol. A detrimental relationship between elevated endogenous LH secretion and failure of implantation has been established. The nature of the short-Buserelin-gonadotropin regimen provokes high levels of endogenous gonadotropin secretion in the early follicular phase and induces a suppression of gonadotropin secretion in the late follicular phase. This may be the physiologic basis of the greater implantation rate after short-Buserelin-gonadotropin treatment than is seen with conventional CC/hMG treatment.\r"

Insulin secretion is stimulated by exposure of these cells to fetal bovine serum and a combination of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and glutamine but not by concentrations of glucose in the physiological range. Insulin processing appears to be intact. Neither class I nor class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens are routinely expressed at the cell surface; however, MHC class I--but not class II--encoded gene products are detected after treatment with recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) alone or in combination with tumor necrosis factor. Cytolysis of IgSV195 cells by SV40 T-antigen-specific H-2b-restricted lymphocytes is similarly dependent on IFN-gamma pretreatment. These results emphasize that SV40 T-antigen transgenic mice are likely sources of cell lines that retain their differentiated function in vitro. The IgSV195 cell line provides an accessible model in which to investigate the control of gene expression and function of pancreatic beta-cells.\r"

It is not clear whether sorbitol accumulation results from increases in substrate, activity of the aldose reductase (AR) protein molecule, or activity due to an increase in the amount of enzyme present. In this study, we have quantitated renal AR activity, immunoreactivity, and mRNA in rats 3 mo after induction of diabetes with streptozocin (STZ-D, 65 mg/kg body wt). Renal AR activity was significantly increased in diabetic rats compared with age-matched nondiabetic controls (0.95 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.51 +/- 0.03 U.mg-1.h-1, respectively, P less than .0005). Western blot analysis demonstrated that the antiserums recognized a single 40,000-Mr protein species in renal homogenates from both diabetic and nondiabetic rats. When quantitated in an immunodot assay, AR immunoreactivity was significantly increased in diabetic rats compared with nondiabetic controls (0.57 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.33 +/- 0.02 U, respectively, P less than .0005). Hybridization of Northern blots with a synthetic 36-nucleotide oligomer and an AR cDNA identified a 1.4-kilobase pair transcript; the abundance of the transcript was significantly increased in poly(A)+ RNA from the kidneys of diabetic compared with nondiabetic rats (P less than .005). This study demonstrates that renal AR activity is increased in the STZ-D rats and suggests that the increased AR activity can be in part explained by enhanced AR gene expression.\r"

After 1 mo of diabetes, GFR was elevated over control values in the STZ-D rats but was not affected by treatment with statil (an aldose reductase inhibitor). In another set of rats maintained for 7 mo, albuminuria was significantly increased in the diabetic rats from 2 mo on but was also not affected by statil treatment. Similarly, histological glomerular damage and diabetes-induced kidney hypertrophy were also greater in diabetic animals but were not altered by statil treatment. The frequency of diabetic cataracts was reduced by statil, and erythrocyte and kidney sorbitol levels were normalized, confirming the efficacy of ARI. Thus, inhibition of the aldose reductase pathway with statil does not ameliorate the hemodynamic, proteinuric, histological, or growth abnormalities in this model of diabetic nephropathy.\r"

  ".W": "Neuroblastoma cells were used to analyze the effect of galactose supplementation on myo-inositol metabolism, polyol accumulation, and Na+-K+ pump activity. Culturing cells in 30 mM galactose for a minimum of 1 wk led to a large accumulation of intracellular galactitol and a greater than 50% decrease in myo-inositol content. The effect of galactose on the intracellular content of galactitol and myo-inositol was concentration dependent. Extracellular myo-inositol accumulation and incorporation into phospholipid decreased by 20-30% in cells grown in 30 mM galactose. The decrease in myo-inositol accumulation is apparently due to a noncompetitive inhibition of high-affinity myo-inositol uptake. Treatment of the galactose-containing media with 0.4 mM sorbinil partially prevented the galactose-mediated decreases in myo-inositol metabolism and content. The galactitol content of the sorbinil-treated cells was significantly reduced compared with the galactitol levels in cells cultured in 30 mM galactose; however, galactitol levels remained significantly elevated over control cells. Exposing neuroblastoma cells to 30 mM galactose causes a decrease in the levels of phosphatidylinositol that is partially restored by the addition of sorbinil. The activity of the Na+-K+ pump was decreased by 20% in cells cultured in 30 mM galactose and was partially protected by sorbinil treatment. The effects of long-term galactose supplementation on myo-inositol metabolism, polyol accumulation, and Na+-K+-ATPase transport activity in cultured neuroblastoma cells are similar to the effects of high concentrations of glucose. These results provide additional evidence that the accumulation of polyol by neuroblastoma cells is partially responsible for alterations in myo-inositol metabolism and decreases in Na+-K+-ATPase transport activity.\r"

Although studies using neutropenic animals demonstrate the essential role of neutrophils in FMLP-induced mucosal injury, the neutrophil-derived chemical mediator of this injury process remains undefined. The objective of this study was to determine whether neutrophilic proteases mediate FMLP-induced increases in mucosal permeability. The blood-to-lumen clearance of 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetate was used to monitor mucosal permeability in the terminal ileum of Sprague-Dawley rats. In control (untreated) animals luminal perfusion with 10(-5) M FMLP resulted in twofold and fourfold increases in 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetate clearance after 1 and 2 h of FMLP exposure, respectively. Pretreatment with the nonspecific serine protease inhibitor, soybean trypsin inhibitor (15 mg/kg), significantly attenuated the clearance responses normally observed during luminal perfusion with FMLP. The specific elastase inhibitors MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-CH2Cl (10 mg/kg) and Eglin c (8 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the FMLP-induced increases in ethylenediaminetetraacetate clearance observed after both 1 and 2 h of exposure. The results of this study indicate that neutrophilic proteases mediate at least part of the increased mucosal permeability induced by luminal exposure to FMLP.\r"

To test this possibility we administered the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil by intravenous injection to 14 patients with hepatic encephalopathy complicating cirrhosis. Flumazenil administration induced variable and transient, but distinct, improvements of the mental status in 71% of the patients. The degree of encephalopathy improved from stage IV to stage II in 4 patients and from stage IV to stage III in 2 patients. The mental status of all patients with less advanced encephalopathy (3 with stage III, 1 with stage II) also improved, but these responses were clinically less impressive. The arousal effect occurred within minutes after the injection and lasted for 1 to 2 h. Furthermore, it was associated with a significant increase of the mean electroencephalographic frequency from 4.2 to 5.2 cycle/s. Of the 8 patients who were ultimately discharged from the hospital, 7 had responded to flumazenil. No patient who died within 48 h of receiving flumazenil had shown any arousal effect. These findings strongly favor a prominent pathogenetic role of increased GABAergic tone in hepatic encephalopathy in humans and suggest that a positive response to flumazenil might be of prognostic value in predicting short-term survival in encephalopathic patients with liver disease.\r"

This report evaluates chyle composition in a patient with chylothorax who was placed on a low-fat diet, medium-chain triglyceride diet, and total parenteral nutrition in sequence. Both triglyceride content and volume of chyle declined, but drainage persisted, ultimately requiring thoracic duct ligation. The chyle triglyceride while on total parenteral nutrition, which presumably originates from both the intestine and plasma, contained more long-chain unsaturated fatty acids than the circulating serum triglyceride. Of particular interest was the detection of an appreciable amount of medium-chain fatty acids in the chyle triglyceride, constituting 20% of the triglyceride fatty acids when an enteral formulation with medium-chain triglyceride as a sole fat source was administered. The finding of almost threefold more decanoic acid (C10:0) than octanoic acid (C8:0), despite the presence of considerably more octanoic acid in the original diet, suggests that trioctanoin may be a preferable medium-chain triglyceride substrate for the nonsurgical treatment of chylothorax.\r"

Neither superoxide dismutase nor catalase reduced the FMLP-induced increase in mucosal permeability. However, manganese-loaded desferrioxamine (a superoxide dismutase mimetic), PZ51 (a glutathione peroxidase analogue), desferrioxamine (an iron chelator), or dimethylsulfoxide (a hydroxyl radical scavenger) significantly attenuated FMLP-induced mucosal damage. The results of our experiments indicate that neutrophilic oxidants are responsible for a major portion of the mucosal permeability changes induced by FMLP.\r"

Continuous recordings, lasting 20 hours, were carried out in patients after correction of their nutritional status and significant improvement of the Crohn's disease activity index. In five of the seven patients, we recorded seven to 14 phase III episodes (PIII) (median: 10), both more frequent and slower during the nocturnal part of the recording time as compared with diurnal. Seven to 18 PIIIs (median: 12) were found in controls. The overall duration of the motor activity was not different between these five patients and controls. In the remaining two patients, no PIII episode was recorded and 79% and 57% respectively of the whole recording time consisted of irregular motor activity. Our work therefore, shows that: (a) PIIIs remain and have a circadian variation in their periodicity and propagation velocity, in most of our patients undergoing longterm CTPN (b) CTPN does not determine a longer duration of motor rest of the small bowel in patients than in controls submitted for a short period of time to the same parenteral intake.\r"

The mean TRH concentration (by RIA) in 16 prolactinomas was 247 +/- 92 (+/- SE) fmol/mg cell protein (range, 10-1297), near that found in normal pituitary tissue. The prolactinoma TRH content did not correlate with the patient's tumor size or plasma PRL level. By contrast, DA assayed by high pressure liquid chromatography was present in normal pituitary tissue (7.3 +/- 3.5 pmol/mg cell protein), but was very low or undetectable in the prolactinomas (23 fmol/mg cell protein or less). 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, also assayed by high pressure liquid chromatography, was undetectable in both normal pituitary tissue and prolactinomas. This imbalance between TRH and DA content also was found in GH-secreting and nonsecreting adenomas. The TRH content in 18 GH-secreting tumors (24 +/- 6 fmol/mg) was considerably lower than that in the prolactinomas (P less than 0.001). In 8 nonsecreting adenomas, the mean TRH concentration was 109 +/- 28 fmol/mg, about half of that in the prolactinomas. In those 2 types of adenomas, DA also was nearly undetectable (less than or equal to 73 fmol/mg cell protein). We conclude that the imbalance between TRH and DA contents in prolactinomas compared to those in normal pituitary tissue might participate in the mechanisms leading to hypersecretion of PRL and the growth of all types of pituitary adenomas.\r"

The men underwent GHRH testing after 3 h of infusion of NaCl or Met-human (h) GH (2 micrograms/kg.h). The results of these tests were compared with those of five men tested in the post-absorptive state (PA subjects). The serum GH response to GHRH during NaCl infusion was significantly lower in the TPN subjects than in the PA subjects. During the Met-hGH infusion, the serum GH response to GHRH in the PA subjects was significantly lower than that after the NaCl infusion, whereas in the TPN subjects the response was similar to that during the NaCl infusion. The mean integrated areas under the GH response-time curve after GHRH treatment were 3963 +/- 2086 min/micrograms.L following NaCl infusion and 413 +/- 64 min/micrograms.L following Met-hGH infusion in PA subjects; they were 1127 +/- 500 min/micrograms.L following NaCl infusion and 1456 +/- 682 min/micrograms.L during Met-hGH infusion in the TPN subjects. The Met-hGH infusions resulted in a significant increase in serum FFA concentrations in the PA, but not the TPN, subjects. These results suggest that hyperalimentation induces a metabolic background which inhibits GH secretion, as manifested by a diminished serum GH response to GHRH administered after NaCl infusion. The absent FFA response to Met-hGH infusion in the TPN subjects may explain why the Met-hGH infusion in them did not result in a reduced serum GH response to GHRH as occurred in the PA subjects. Hence, FFA may play an important role in the effects of short term Met-hGH infusion on GH secretion.\r"

GHRH-(1-29)NH2 and G-DAMME each induced a rise in serum GH, and the increase was greater when both were given together. Since the GHRH-(1-29)NH2 dose (100 micrograms) used was a maximally stimulatory one, these results suggest that the enhancing effect of G-DAMME on GHRH-induced GH release may be mediated through inhibition of somatostatin release.\r"

  ".U": "89327424\r", 
  ".W": "Normal pituitary and gonadal function can be maintained with long term pulsatile GnRH administration in men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), and both pituitary and gonadal priming occur during the process of GnRH-induced sexual maturation. Still, the long term effects of discontinuing GnRH therapy in IHH men have not been examined. Therefore, we evaluated the patterns of gonadotropin and alpha-subunit secretion before and after a prolonged period of pulsatile GnRH administration in 10 IHH men. Before exogenous GnRH stimulation, no patient had any detectable LH pulsations. In 6 of these men, who were typical of most of our IHH patients (group I), no LH pulsations were detectable after cessation of GnRH administration. However, in the other 4 men (group II), LH pulsations were easily detectable despite cessation of exogenous GnRH stimulation, and the amplitude (9.3 +/- 3.5 IU/L) and frequency (13.8 +/- 1.7 pulses/day) of these LH pulses were similar to those in 20 normal men (10.6 +/- 0.7 IU/L and 11.0 +/- 0.7 pulses/day). Three of these 4 men in group II maintained normal serum testosterone levels after discontinuation of GnRH delivery. To determine if there were any characteristics that might be useful in predicting which IHH men could maintain normal pituitary-gonadal function after long term GnRH administration, we evaluated various clinical and hormonal parameters at the time of initial presentation. Mean alpha-subunit levels (P less than 0.01) and alpha-subunit pulse amplitude (P less than 0.02) were significantly higher in the group II than the group I men, suggesting that the group II patients had partial, rather than complete, deficiency of endogenous GnRH secretion. None of the other parameters that were assessed distinguished the two groups. We conclude that gonadotropin and sex steroid levels return to their pretreatment state in the majority of IHH men when long term GnRH administration is discontinued. Normal pituitary-gonadal function can be maintained after discontinuation of long term GnRH administration in a rare subset of IHH men who present with higher levels of alpha-subunit. We hypothesize that these latter IHH men have an incomplete GnRH deficiency and that long term exogenous GnRH administration induces pituitary and gonadal priming, which subsequently enables them to sustain normal pituitary and gonadal function in response to their own enfeebled GnRH secretion.\r"

We studied the effects of recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN gamma) and recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rTNF alpha) on normal human thyroid cells. We found that the combination of these two cytokines enhanced HLA class II molecule expression on these cells compared with the effect of rIFN gamma alone. This was proven by both immunofluorescence as well as a more sensitive and quantitative RIA. rTNF alpha alone had no effect on HLA class II molecule induction on the same thyrocytes, suggesting a synergistic rather than an additive action in combination with rIFN gamma. The addition of 600 U/ml rTNF alpha to low dose rIFN gamma (10 U/mL) enhanced class II expression by 50%, as quantified by RIA. We also demonstrated that normal thyrocytes possess distinct receptors for the two cytokines and that rTNF alpha probably augments IFN gamma binding, since it increased when the cells were first incubated with rTNF alpha. This increased binding provides an explanation for the synergistic action of rTNF alpha in enhancing class II molecule expression by rIFN gamma. We conclude that the presence of receptors for these cytokines on human thyroid cells gives a direct demonstration of their potential biological action on cells normally not involved in the immunological circuit. The phenomenon might also explain their direct or indirect involvement in vivo, such as in influencing inappropriate HLA class II molecule expression in epithelial cells affected by autoimmunity.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of LHRH agonist administration on serum PRL levels in five women with microprolactinomas and two women and a man with intrasellar macroprolactinomas. Each patient received either D-Trp6-LHRH or buserelin for 90 days. Serum PRL levels decreased significantly in the patients with microprolactinomas by 65%, from 156 +/- 93 (+/- SD) to 54 +/- 49 micrograms/L on day 90 (P = 0.011), but it did not decrease in the macroprolactinoma patients. Mean serum LH and FSH decreased by 43% and 62.5%, respectively, in all eight patients. There was no statistically significant correlation between the serum PRL and LH or FSH levels in the microprolactinoma patients. We conclude that LHRH agonists can counteract the hyperprolactinemia produced by microprolactinomas and that the effect probably is not exerted by an action on the gonadotrophs.\r"

All of the patients showed a significant increase in plasma GH concentration, with a mean peak of 31.4 +/- 4.5 micrograms/L at 15 min (P less than 0.001 vs. basal values; range, 18.4-65 micrograms/L) after GHRH, which was not different from that of the control group of idiopathic short stature children (40.1 +/- 3.4 micrograms/L; range, 21-65.4 micrograms/L). All but 1 of the thalassemic patients had a normal GH response to the arginine-insulin stimulation test. The mean plasma insulin-like growth factor-I level was low (0.12 +/- 0.05 U x 10(3)/L; range, less than 0.02-0.61 U x 10(3)/L). Analysis of these results as well as previously reported data indicating that older thalassemic patients have an impaired GH response indicates that there may be an age-related pituitary and/or hypothalamic dysfunction in thalassemic children. This study also confirms that the insulin-like growth factor-I decrease occurs before any alteration in GH secretion. These changes might play a role in the early growth retardation that occurs in these patients.\r"

More recently, 1,25-(OH)2D has been shown to be produced by and act on human inflammatory cells in vitro, suggesting that the hormone may be an important modulator of the host immune response. We have recently detected high concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D in the pleural fluid (PF) of patients with tuberculous pleuritis. Working on the hypothesis that tuberculous PF contained a soluble cytokine which stimulated 1,25-(OH)2D production by tissue (pleura)-based macrophages, we examined the potential for PF from five patients with tuberculous pleuritis to potentiate 1,25-(OH)2D synthesis by heterologous pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) from patients with sarcoidosis; PAM from patients with active pulmonary sarcoidosis constitutively express a 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-hydroxylation reaction in vitro. We demonstrated that tuberculous PF had a concentration-dependent potentiating effect on PAM 1,25-(OH)2D synthesis. The potentiating activity was positively correlated to the interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) concentration of the PF (r = 0.98; P less than 0.01) and was inhibited by 49-89% after coincubation with anti-IFN gamma monoclonal antibody (1:20,000-1:200 dilution). These data suggest that IFN gamma may be an important peripleural regulator of macrophage 1,25-(OH)2D synthesis in patients with tuberculous pleuritis and a high pleural fluid 1,25-(OH)2D concentration.\r"

In order to further clarify the inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma on TSH-stimulated thyroid hormone secretion, we have examined human thyroid peroxidase (TPO) gene expression. Thyrocytes dispersed from Graves' thyroid tissues were incubated with TSH with or without IFN-gamma. Total RNA was extracted, separated and hybridized with 32P-labelled human TPO cDNA. Thyrocytes expressed four TPO mRNA transcripts (4.0, 3.2, 2.1 and 1.7kb, respectively), all of which were stimulated by TSH. IFN-gamma inhibited TSH-stimulated TPO mRNA in a dose dependent manner (0.01-10U/mL). 1 U/mL IFN-gamma caused maximal suppression of TSH-stimulated TPO mRNA levels to basal levels. IFN-gamma also inhibited 8-bromo-cyclic AMP-stimulated TPO mRNA levels. In contrast, the gamma-actin mRNA hybridization signal was not altered in control or treated cells. These results demonstrate that IFN-gamma directly inhibits TSH-stimulated TPO gene expression and provide further support for a role of IFN-gamma as a local modulator of thyroid hormone synthesis.\r"

Thirty-five patients were treated with mupirocin and 35 patients were treated with fusidic acid three times a day for seven days. Clinical and bacteriologic assessments were conducted before and after treatment. The efficacy of mupirocin, in terms of resolution and improvement of clinical signs and symptoms of infection, as well as of the elimination of infecting organisms, was similar to that of fusidic acid. Of 34 patients (1 could not be evaluated) treated with mupirocin, a clinical cure was achieved in 18, and significant improvement was demonstrated in 15. Similarly, of 35 patients treated with fusidic acid, a clinical cure was achieved in 18 and improvement occurred in 15. Bacteriologic cure rates were 97% (30 of 31 patients evaluated) in the mupirocin-treated group, compared with 87% (27 of 31 patients evaluated) in the fusidic acid-treated group. No side effects were observed in either treatment group. Because topical 2% mupirocin has little or no potential for irritation, systemic side effects, or cross-resistance with other antibiotics, its efficacy is likely to make this new compound a useful agent for the treatment of superficial skin infections.\r"

  ".W": "The field has progressed to the point where a genetic investigation of the aging processes in Drosophila can be viewed as constituting both a serious and a feasible research program. There now exists at least one single gene mutant which yields an accelerated aging phenotype, at least two single gene null mutants affecting enzymes implicated in regulating the aging process and resulting in premature death, and at least two strains created by artificial selection which produce extended-longevity phenotypes. In addition, genes such as adh have an indirect and interactive effect upon the animal's longevity and might also play an important role in the genetic regulation of this process. Although far from complete, some essential tools are now in place and are being used to answer some of the questions posed by Martin. Of the several theories put forth to explain aging in Drosophila, it appears as if the data best uphold the free radical and the protein synthesis/gene expression theories. It is entirely possible that these two theories are complementary aspects of a broader underlying process. The genetic mechanisms controlling these physiological processes clearly do so in concert with certain environmental factors. The net effect of their interactions may be the decreased synthetic and repair ability of the cell as suggested by Lamb and by Webster. It is probably true that aging and longevity are multicausal phenotypes. Our only hope of understanding such a complex phenotype is to dissect it genetically, one (or a few) genes at a time under rigidly controlled conditions. Thorough genetic description of each system will be the prerequisite to their molecular analysis. This will likely result in multiple explanations, ideally one for each system. Yet these multiple molecular genetic explanations may well enable us to see some commonality underlying the aging process in this organism. The fact that several different lines of evidence appear to be converging on a small number of theoretical explanations is an encouraging sign. We should also be heartened by the extraordinary increase in our knowledge of embryonic development in Drosophila as a result of just such a strategy. And we should not forget that the homeotic mutants which now play such a large role in the deciphering of embryogenesis were once classified as \"complex loci\" and that the then-accepted explanations gave no hint of the underlying molecular relationships. For now it is fair to conclude that aging in Drosophila may be viewed as a genetically-determined, environmentally-modulated, event-dependent process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Basally and at 30-min intervals for 8 h after lactose challenge, end-alveolar breath samples were collected and analyzed for hydrogen using gas chromatography. Symptoms were scored at 30 min and hourly for 8 h, rating bloating, cramps, nausea, pain, diarrhea, and flatulence. Four challenges were performed on 4 separate days with at least 3 days between challenges. The first two challenges served as baselines. Just before ingestion of 50 g powdered lactose dissolved in 200 ml water, beta-D-galactosidase capsules were given orally as a 250-mg dose for the third challenge and a 500-mg dose for challenge 4. Hydrogen excretion, quantified by using a trapezoidal method for computing area under the discontinuous curve of breath hydrogen concentration, was decreased in subjects receiving beta-D-galactosidase (base-line I, 346.0 ppm/h; baseline II, 367.2 ppm/h; 250-mg galactosidase 208.2 ppm/h; 500-mg galactosidase, 178.0 ppm/h; p less than or equal to 0.05). Other analyzed parameters of H2 excretion were also decreased. Analysis of symptom response scores showed a dose-related decrease for bloating and flatus (p less than or equal to 0.05) and no statistical difference in the other assessed symptoms. We conclude that beta-D-galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae, when given just before ingestion of lactose by lactose malabsorbers, can produce a dose-dependent reduction (statistically significant for the 500-mg dose) in breath hydrogen excretion, bloating, and flatus.\r"

Negative serologies for hepatitis A and B were found. Liver histology showed severe hepatocellular injury. A diagnosis of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis with acute features was made on the basis of high titers of antinuclear antibody and smooth muscle antibody and the presence of hypergammaglobulinemia. As immunosuppressive therapy is a beneficial treatment of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, an acute presentation of this liver disease should be considered as an alternative diagnosis to acute non-A, non-B hepatitis in patients with these clinical characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "Tyrosinase synthesis and its posttranslational processing was compared in hair follicular melanocytes of C3H-HeAvy mice during eumelanogenesis and phaeomelanogenesis. Tyrosinase activity was increased during eumelanogenesis and this was paralleled by an increase in tyrosinase synthesis, as measured by the incorporation of [35S]methionine. Although tyrosinase activity was lower during phaeomelanogenesis there was no change in tyrosinase synthesis. alpha-Melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) increased tyrosinase activity and its synthesis during eumelanogenesis but not during phaeomelanogenesis. Bromo-adenosine 3,5-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt (8-bromo-cAMP) was similarly effective during eumelanogenesis, but unlike alpha-MSH stimulated tyrosinase synthesis during phaeomelanogenesis. This suggests that during phaeomelanogenesis the melanocytes may fail to express MSH receptors. This cannot account for the lower tyrosinase activity, however, for alpha-MSH acts predominantly at the level of tyrosinase synthesis and this was similar during eumelanin and phaeomelanin production. The reduced tyrosinase activity is, therefore, presumably due to some posttranslational change. Accordingly, less tyrosinase was associated with the melanosomal fraction during phaeomelanogenesis than during eumelanogenesis. Glycosylation of tyrosinase, as measured by the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine was also reduced during phaeomelanogenesis. Although 8-bromo-cAMP increased glycosylation of tyrosinase in both eumelanin and phaeomelanin producing melanocytes, it failed to alter the subcellular distribution of the enzyme. It would appear that, although glycosylation of tyrosinase is lower during phaeomelanogenesis, the reduced tyrosinase expression is the result of decreased uptake of tyrosinase by the melanosome.\r"

  ".W": "Dispase, a neutral protease isolated from culture filtrates of Bacillus polymyxa, has proven to be a rapid, effective, but gentle agent for separating intact epidermis from the dermis and intact epithelial sheets in culture from the substratum. In both cases it effects separation by cleaving the basement membrane zone region while preserving the viability of the epithelial cells. Because it is not known what or where in the basement membrane zone Dispase cleaves, we set up studies to define its substrate specificity. Using purified basement membrane components and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis we show that Dispase cleaves fibronectin and type IV collagen, but not laminin, type V collagen, serum albumin, or transferrin. The action of Dispase on collagen appears to be selective for type IV collagen in that several stable degradation products are formed, whereas the enzyme degrades type I collagen only minimally. In newborn human skin, as seen by electron microscopy, Dispase removes the lamina densa, rich in type IV collagen, but preserves the anchoring fibrils (structures known to contain type VII collagen) and the epidermal cells. Because its action is so selective, it suggests that Dispase can serve as a powerful tool for dissecting epithelial-mesenchymal interactions.\r"

  ".U": "89327993\r", 
  ".W": "Cutaneous vasomotion has not been actively investigated until recently. This is hardly surprising, as it has not been a reproducible phenomenon. During recent studies on various physiological and pharmacological vascular problems, we identified experimental conditions in which cutaneous vasomotion commonly occurred. We then characterized four methods that routinely provoke human cutaneous vasomotion in vivo, in order to further characterize this physiological phenomenon. Although several adaptive advantages may exist for vasomotion, the most compelling theory can be derived mathematically from Poiseuille's law. Because the flow of a liquid through a vessel is proportional to the fourth power of the radius, it can be demonstrated that the resistance of a vessel with a constant diameter is greater than that of a vessel of the same average diameter in which the diameter changes sinusoidally. Importantly, the rhythmicity originates within the vascular tissue, and there appears to be electromechanical coupling. The cation effluxes demonstrate oscillatory behavior that may be driven by the availability of adenosine triphosphate. Substrate and product concentrations can alter the activity of the allosteric enzyme, phosphofructokinase, which may control the oscillations in ATP concentration. Despite the qualitatively different provocative agents, the cutaneous rhythmic oscillatory vasomotion always first appears after a peak in erythrocyte flux, and it disappears before reaching resting flux levels. Thus, cutaneous rhythmic oscillatory vasomotion is a midrange phenomenon, most likely corresponding to the \"oscillatory domain\" of glycolysis. Finally, a common feature of tissue preparations for the study of vasomotion is that anesthesia was not used. We have shown that this inhibitory effect of anesthetic agents may persist well beyond \"anesthesia,\" and this suppression may be of clinical importance in the patient with microcirculatory compromise undergoing surgery.\r"

The mechanism by which a deficiency of zinc may affect lymphocyte proliferation and functions, is not well understood at present.

This effect has been related to an accumulation of toxic nucleotides in lymphocytes as a result of NPase deficiency. Inasmuch as the effect of zinc deficiency on the activity of NPase and the levels of nucleotides in human lymphocytes has not been previously reported, we assayed these parameters in human subjects with zinc deficiency before and after zinc supplementation. A mild deficiency of zinc was diagnosed in those having decreased zinc in two out of three cell lineages (less than 42 micrograms in granulocytes, less than 48 micrograms in lymphocytes, and less than 1.70 microgram in platelets, per 10(10) cells). In comparison with five subjects with sufficient zinc, six subjects with zinc deficiency showed a decrease in the activity of NPase (p = 0.01), an increase in adenosine diphosphate (ADP) level (p = 0.008), a decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-to-ADP ratio (p = 0.0001), and an increase in both guanosine triphosphate (GTP) (p = 0.02) and deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dGTP) (p = 0.04 in the lymphocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been shown to increase the synthesis of hyaluronic acid in cultured fibroblasts by increasing the activity of hyaluronate synthetase, a group of plasma membrane-bound synthetic enzymes. We examined whether PGE2 also increased the activity of those enzyme systems involved in the synthesis of sulfated glycosaminoglycan in the human embryonic lung fibroblast. Exposure of cells to PGE2 resulted in dose-dependent increases in glucosamine incorporation into all sulfated glycosaminoglycan subtypes. PGE2 at 10(-7) mol/L increased total glycosaminoglycan per dish to 21.6 +/- 3.1 micrograms versus 12.0 +/- 2.5 micrograms in control untreated cultures. Stimulation of endogenous PGE2 production by bradykinin had a similar effect on glycosaminoglycan synthesis. To examine whether PGE2 affected sulfated glycosaminoglycan protein core production, cells were labeled with tritiated glucosamine in the presence of cycloheximide. Under these conditions, incorporation of radiolabel into all glycosaminoglycan subtypes was reduced. However, when exogenous sulfated glycosaminoglycan chain initiator (p-nitrophenyl beta-D-xyloside) was added, incorporation of tritiated glucosamine into sulfated glycosaminoglycan increased but not to levels found in control cultures. Application of PGE2 to cultures treated with cycloheximide alone, or to cultures treated with cycloheximide plus xyloside, increased tritiated glucosamine incorporation into chondroitin, dermatan sulfate, and to a lesser extent into heparan sulfate. We conclude that PGE2 stimulates synthesis of all sulfated glycosaminoglycan even in the absence of new protein core production, probably by increasing activities of sulfated glycosaminoglycan synthetase enzymes. PGE2 stimulation of heparan sulfate synthesis is partially dependent on the availability of heparan sulfate-specific protein core.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirty-four pre- and perimenopausal patients presenting with metastatic breast cancer (median age, 42 years; range, 25 to 55) were treated with goserelin (Zoladex [ICI 118 630]; ICI Pharma, Plankstadt, Germany) a long-acting gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-analogue depot formulation, injected subcutaneously every 4 weeks, as a first-line therapy. One hundred eighteen patients were evaluable for response. Serum concentrations of estradiol, luteinizing hormones (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormones were significantly suppressed by Zoladex. Mean serum estradiol values fell into the range of castrated or postmenopausal women within 2 to 3 weeks of therapy. This suppression was maintained for the duration of therapy. Overall objective response was: 12 (10.2%) complete remission; 41 (34.7%) partial remission; 33 (28.0%) no change; and 32 (27.1%) progression. In responders, the median time to response was 4 months (range, 2 to 11 months), median duration of response was 8 + months (range 2 to 24 months), and median time to progression was 11 + months (range, 5 to 30 months). Objective responses were seen for different sites of metastases: loco-regional (62.5%), bone (46.7%), visceral (45.0%), and multiple (35.1%). Tumor remission was more common in patients in which the primary tumor was estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (49.3%) or ER-unknown (44.0%), but appreciable response rates were also observed in ER-poor patients (33.3%). Zoladex depot was well tolerated both locally and systemically. It produced effective castration and the objective response rates and duration of remission are at least comparable to those seen following oophorectomy; however, the side effects are less. The use of depot Zoladex avoids the psychological trauma and operative morbidity of the irreversible operative castration.\r"

  ".W": "The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) conducted a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the role of warfarin and alternating chemotherapy in extensive small-cell lung cancer (SCCL). After stratification for sex and performance status, patients were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy with methotrexate, doxorubicin (Adriamycin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), cyclophosphamide, and lomustine (CCNU) (MACC), or MACC plus warfarin (MACC + W), or mitomycin, etoposide, cisplatin, and hexamethylmelamine alternating with MACC (MEPH/MACC). Warfarin was given continuously to maintain a prothrombin time of one and one half to twice the control values. A total of 328 patients were enrolled, and 294 were evaluable. There was a statistically significant advantage in objective response rates (complete [CR] and partial responses [PR], respectively) for MACC + W (17% and 50%) as compared with MACC alone (8% and 43%) or MEPH/MACC (10% and 38%) (P = .012). Both failure-free survival (P = .054 Wilcoxon test) and overall survival (P = .098 Wilcoxon test) were higher on MACC + W (median, 6.6 months and 9.3 months, respectively), as compared with MACC (5.0 months and 7.9 months) and MEPH/MACC (5.0 months and 7.9 months). Toxicity was comparable among the three arms, except for increased hemorrhagic events on MACC + W, which were life-threatening in four patients (4%), and lethal in two others (2%). These data support the role of warfarin in the treatment of SCCL, but do not establish its mechanism of action. Warfarin deserves further studies in SCCL, particularly in patients with limited disease.\r"

In the remaining four subjects without obstructive airways disease, ventilation and planar perfusion scans were normal. Single photon emission computed tomography imaging of pulmonary perfusion in these patients revealed a layered distribution of blood flow indistinguishable from that of normal individuals. It is concluded that neurogenic mechanisms have little influence on the pattern of local pulmonary blood flow at rest.\r"

  ".W": "Although few reports address the use of three-phase bone scanning (TPBS) and 111In-labeled white blood cell (In-WBC) scintigraphy in hip arthroplasty utilizing a porous coated prosthesis, the literature suggests that scintigraphic patterns in the uncomplicated patient may differ from that seen in the cemented prosthesis. In an attempt to determine the scintigraphic natural history, 25 uncomplicated porous coated hip arthroplasties in 21 patients were prospectively studied with serial TPBS and In-WBC at approximately 7 days, and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo postoperatively. This report deals with findings related to the prosthetic tip. Only one of 136 flow studies were abnormal and only two of 136 blood-pool images demonstrated focally increased activity. All 25 prostheses (120 of 143 scans) demonstrated increased uptake on the bone phase images. The area about the tip was divided into three segments; increased uptake at 24 mo was noted in the medial, distal, and lateral segments in 16%, 72%, and 56% of prostheses, respectively. Twenty of 25 prostheses (82 of 142 scans) showed uptake on In-WBC scintigraphy, being noted in 48% of prostheses at 24 mo. We conclude that scintigraphic patterns in the uncomplicated patient with a porous coated prosthesis appear to differ from patterns described in cemented prostheses.\r"

Health and growth were restored, and there was minimal production of abnormal metabolites. The dramatic clinical and biochemical improvement of these patients bolsters the concept that most of the toxic metabolites produced in these diseases are not related to the administered load of nutrient precursors, but rather to endogenous turnover of amino acids, particularly during a chronic catabolic state. Suppression of catabolism can produce striking biochemical and clinical improvement. With appropriate monitoring, parenteral nutrition can be used safely in the management of patients with these disorders.\r"

Twenty infants (mean birth weight 1103 +/- 216 gm, mean gestation 28.5 +/- 1.7 weeks) were randomly assigned to receive sodium in doses of either 1 or 3 mmol.kg-1.day-1 for the first 10 postnatal days. Extracellular volume (estimated by the bromide dilution method), sodium excretion, creatinine clearance, fractional sodium excretion, plasma atrial natriuretic factor level, urine aldosterone concentration, and vasopressin excretion were measured on postnatal days 1, 5, 10, 20, and 30. The corrected bromide space was large at birth and decreased in both groups during the first 5 days of observation, concomitant with a negative sodium balance. After 5 days of age, sodium excretion decreased in both groups so that sodium balance became positive and the corrected bromide space increased in proportion to increasing body weight. Differences in sodium intake were associated with differences in tubular sodium reabsorption; corrected bromide space and net sodium balance were similar in the two groups. Serum sodium concentration was significantly lower in the low-sodium intake group. Creatinine clearance, plasma atrial natriuretic factor level, and excretion of aldosterone and vasopressin were not significantly different between the two groups. We conclude that very low birth weight infants are able to regulate sodium balance by altering renal sodium excretion. However, the renal response to sodium intake may be insufficient to prevent changes in serum sodium concentration. The roles of specific renal and hormonal mechanisms regulating sodium excretion in very low birth weight infants remain incompletely defined.\r"

Abrupt termination of hyperventilation after 6 hours resulted in a 110 +/- 71% increase in cerebral blood flow over baseline after 30 minutes of normocapnia. This cerebral hyperemia persisted for at least 90 minutes after hyperventilation was discontinued. Cerebral oxygen consumption did not change throughout the study. The posthypocapnia hyperemia noted in these animals after abrupt normalization of arterial carbon dioxide pressure may contribute to the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage in newborn infants who are treated similarly in the management of pulmonary hypertension.\r"

In serial twofold dilution experiments, there was no significant difference in sensitivity between these two assays in the detection of HIV serum antigen.

Lysine supplementation of wheat gluten during the postinitiation period enhanced the gamma-glutamyltransferase-positive response to a level comparable with that of the high-quality protein. These results suggest that one can inhibit the development of foci either by decreasing the quantity of protein intake and holding the quality of the protein constant or by decreasing the quality and holding the quantity constant.\r"

Four years after PVB treatment, none of the patients were azoospermic; after 5 years, the total sperm counts in 46% of the patients had reached their pretreatment levels. In the group under surveillance, sperm counts below the reference level persisted or developed in 55% of the patients.

A number of extracts were found to be remarkably active against the AIDS virus. A new class of HIV-1-inhibitory compounds, the sulfonic acid-containing glycolipids, was discovered through the use of the microculture assay to guide the fractionation and purification process. The pure compounds were active against HIV-1 in cultured human lymphoblastoid CEM, MT-2, LDV-7, and C3-44 cell lines in the tetrazolium assay as well as in p24 viral protein and syncytium formation assays.\r"

The children were allocated into two groups. One group underwent total circulatory arrest (40 +/- 6 minutes). In the other group perfusion was maintained during deep hypothermia but reduced a 25% of normal at normothermia. The temperature was reduced to 15 degrees C (nasopharynx) in both groups with a combination of topical and core cooling. To study cerebral injury, were made serial measurements of creatine kinase isoenzyme BB from arterial samples before and for 8 hours after the deep hypothermic procedure. Creatine kinase isoenzyme BB increased after both procedures from 4.3 +/- 0.9 ng/ml to 10.4 +/- 1.8 ng/ml in the circulatory arrest group and from 2.8 +/- 0.7 ng/ml to 9.9 +/- 1.9 ng/ml in the low-flow group (no significant difference). The results were analyzed in relation to age, size, study group, hemoglobin, blood glucose, and blood gases. The creatine kinase BB levels were positively related to preoperative hemoglobin and blood glucose values before the hypothermic procedures.\r"

Pilgrims who became group A carriers introduced this clonal group into sub-Saharan Africa on their return from the haj. The introduction of this clonal group into sub-Saharan Africa may be responsible for the current wave of epidemics affecting the region. Although the findings suggest that clonal virulence is an important factor in the development of epidemics of meningococcal disease, other factors also seem to be necessary for the development of an epidemic.\r"

Among patients at high risk of infection (with or without liver disease) anti-HCV antibodies were found in 85% of prospectively followed patients with post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis, 62% of patients with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis and a history of blood transfusion, 70% of haemophiliacs receiving replacement therapy, 70% of intravenous drug abusers, and 20% of haemodialysis patients. Only 8% of homosexual men infected with human immunodeficiency virus and 6% of female contacts of drug abusers were positive. Among patients with liver disease and no history of parenteral exposure to blood, anti-HCV antibodies were detected in 38% with cryptogenic, alcoholic, or primary biliary cirrhosis and in 44% with chronic active hepatitis. Among healthy subjects without risk factors for hepatitis the overall prevalence of anti-HCV was 1.2%.\r"

PTH-NANB developed in 9 patients (index cases); stored serum samples from these patients and from 9 control patients, matched for age, sex, and number of blood product transfusions, as well as serum samples of all implicated blood products, were selected retrospectively. Sera were tested under code with a radioimmunoassay for the detection of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). PTH-NANB patients received 151 blood product transfusions and control patients 140. 4 of 9 PTH-NANB patients (3/5 chronic, 1/4 acute resolved hepatitis) and 0/9 controls seroconverted. 7 of the transfusions given to PTH-NANB patients but none of those given to control patients were anti-HCV positive. In 7 of 9 serum sets from PTH-NANB index cases plus implicated donors, either a donor or the recipient was anti-HCV positive. Among the donors implicated in transmission of PTH-NANB there was a strong correlation between raised alanine aminotransferase levels and the presence of anti-HCV antibodies.\r"

Although there are indications that some gamma delta+ cells can mediate cytotoxicity, their antigen-related functions have not yet been defined. In the mouse, gamma delta+ cells constitute 1-3% of T cells in lymphoid organs. Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and dendritic epidermal cells (DECs) also appear to carry the gamma delta TCR. The strategic locations of DECs and IELs have led to the suggestion that gamma delta+ cells could constitute a first line of defence in the vicinity of large surfaces of contact with the environment. We report here that an estimated 8-20% of resident pulmonary lymphocytes (RPLs) are CD3+ alpha beta TCR-, and presumably gamma delta TCR+. Furthermore, mice exposed to aerosols containing a Mycobacterium tuberculosis extract have an increased number of activated CD3+ alpha beta-TCR- pulmonary T cells which can be propagated in vitro.\r"

  ".U": "89330596\r", 
  ".W": "Most proteins exported from mammalian cells contain a signal sequence which mediates targeting to and insertion into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Involved in this process are the signal-recognition particle (SRP) and docking protein (DP), the receptor for SRP in the ER membrane. SRP interacts with the signal sequence on nascent polypeptide chains and retards their further elongation, which resumes only after interaction of the arrested ribosomal complex with the docking protein. SRP is a ribonucleoprotein particle comprising a 7S RNA and six polypeptides with relative molecular masses (Mr) of 9,000 (9K) 14K, 19K, 54K, 68K and 72K (ref. 1). The 9K and 14K proteins are essential for elongation arrest and the 68K-72K heterodimer is required for docking to the ER membrane. The 54K protein binds to the signal sequence when it emerges from the ribosome. Docking protein consists of two polypeptides, a 72K alpha-subunit (DP alpha) and a 30K beta-subunit (DP beta). No components structurally homologous to SRP and docking protein have yet been found in yeast or Escherichia coli. To understand the molecular nature of the interaction between the signal sequence and its receptor(s) we have characterized a complementary DNA coding for the 54K protein of SRP. Significant sequence homology was found to part of DP alpha and two E. coli proteins of unknown function. The homologous region includes a putative GTP-binding domain.\r"

  ".W": "Protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum in mammalian cells is catalysed by signal recognition particle (SRP). Cross-linking experiments have shown that the subunit of relative molecular mass 54,000 (Mr 54K; SRP54) interacts directly with signal sequences as they emerge from the ribosome. Here we present the sequence of a complementary DNA clone of SRP54 which predicts a protein that contains a putative GTP-binding domain and an unusually methionine-rich domain. The properties of this latter domain suggest that it contains the signal sequence binding site. A previously uncharacterized Escherichia coli protein has strong homology to both domains. Closely homologous GTP-binding domains are also found in the alpha-subunit of the SRP receptor (SR alpha, docking protein) in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and in a second E. coli protein, ftsY, which resembles SR alpha. Recent work has shown that SR alpha is a GTP-binding protein and that GTP is required for the release of SRP from the signal sequence and the ribosome on targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. We propose that SRP54 and SR alpha use GTP in sequential steps of the targeting reaction and that essential features of such a pathway are conserved from bacteria to mammals.\r"

Except for Alternaria, the frequency of and allegenic response to the new molds were generally greater than those for the five old molds. The usual Alternaria-Cladosporium mold screen proved less satisfactory when these five new molds were added to the mold battery; however, the addition of Helminthosporium to the screen corrected this deficiency. Cross-reactivity production of false-positive responses seems unlikely because of frequent significant variance in RAST scores from mold to mold in the same patient.\r"

The latter is produced by repeating the situation eliciting vertigo. In this way the mechanisms of adaptation and compensation are stimulated, processes of which have been considered \"error controlled.\" Clinical experience with the vestibular habituation training test battery (consisting of 19 maneuvers) showed that in each particular patient only a limited number of responses were positive in various combinations. Selecting the exercises is then a logical consequence. Followup showed a progressive reduction of the positive cases, as well as the number of positive maneuvers. This is in accordance with the development of compensation as it has been observed in experimental conditions and with the decline of progressive responses observed in habituation experiments.\r"

The study group comprised 60 patients with nasal obstruction who had 63 preoperative and postoperative rhinomanograms and the control group contained 14 asymptomatic patients who underwent rhinomanometric studies before transnasal, transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. Before surgery the study group had significantly higher total and combined unilateral nasal resistances than either the control group before surgery (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively) or the study group after surgery (p less than 0.0001 for both comparisons). Surgery normalized the nasal resistances of the study group in relation to the control group. A total nasal resistance greater than 1 cm H2O/L/sec or a unilateral resistance greater than 3.5 cm H2O/L/sec suggests clinically significant nasal obstruction. Airway narrowing and obstructive symptoms correlated with airway resistance in the preoperative patient, but symptoms did not correlate well with postoperative resistance.\r"

Whereas all cases but one had marked unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, only two had preoperative facial nerve dysfunction. There are no specific symptoms or physical or audiometric findings to differentiate cavernous hemangiomas from acoustic neuromas. However, a hemangioma should be suspected when facial paralysis is present in conjunction with a small intracanalicular tumor as demonstrated by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The former reveals calcium stippling in the lesions, whereas magnetic resonance imaging reveals a high signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images.\r"

  ".U": "89330989\r", 
  ".W": "Accommodation for head growth presents one of several challenges unique to pediatric cochlear implantation. Given contemporary cochlear implant device designs, an electrode cable implanted at the age of 2 years must extend 2 to 3 cm as the head grows during childhood. In an initial study we found that model lead wires with redundant loops extended effectively when they were maintained within air-containing spaces such as the mastoid cavity or middle ear space. However, when looped leads traversed soft tissues overlying the parietal bone, they became embedded in fibrous tissue and did not extend. The present study evaluated three different configurations of expansile devices that were enclosed in polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) envelopes to deter fibrous ingrowth. This simple strategy was designed to ensure effective cable extension over cable pathlengths by protecting the redundant leads from any mechanically significant connective tissue ingrowth. Twelve such devices were implanted across the calvaria of four newly weaned piglets. Skull growth and changes in electrode dimensions were documented by sequential computed tomographic scans. At 3 months of age, cranial circumferences had increased substantially. Animals were then killed, the model cable extension appliances examined physically, and their implantation sites examined histologically. For all experimental devices, extension of redundant lead wires was satisfactory, and there was no mechanically significant invasion of fibrous connective tissue into the PTFE envelope. This indicates that enclosure of excess lead wire within a PTFE envelope may be an effective means of inhibiting fibrous ingrowth. This strategy should prove useful for ensuring effective electrode cable extension in cochlear implants applied in young children.\r"

  ".W": "Sialorrhea is a distressing problem in children with cerebral palsy, in children with other neurologic disorders, and in normal children. The constant need for clothing or bib changes in handicapped patients frequently results in further social isolation and causes normal children to be viewed as \"impaired.\" The surgical treatment of sialorrhea at Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, has evolved over the past 5 years. Since 1981, 70 surgical procedures have been performed for drooling at this institution; follow-up information is available on 52 patients. The surgical procedures performed included submandibular rerouting alone, submandibular duct rerouting with bilateral tympanic neurectomy with bilateral submandibular gland excision, and bilateral submandibular gland excision with bilateral parotid duct ligation. Our review indicates that bilateral submandibular gland excision with parotid duct ligation is the only procedure in which consistent control of sialorrhea can be expected. Postoperative complications after this procedure were minimal and only one parent complained that the child had a dry mouth after the procedure. Postoperative hospitalization after bilateral submandibular gland excision and bilateral parotid duct ligation was not significantly different from that required after any of the other procedures. In conclusion, this surgical procedure appears to be the most effective surgical treatment for sialorrhea and precludes the need for multiple operative procedures for this problem.\r"

Continuing experience substantiates our earlier impression that the vestibular system usually accommodates rapidly to complete unilateral surgical ablation, regardless of age or degree of residual vestibular activity in the ear (as measured by preoperative bithermal caloric testing). Although the symptom of vertigo is reliably treated by transmastoid labyrinthectomy, a patient questionnaire has demonstrated a significant incidence of mild to moderate persisting postoperative dysequilibrium. Although this dysequilibrium is usually not debilitating, this questionnaire has demonstrated its existence more precisely than a retrospective review of the patients' clinical records. This study reviews 110 patients who underwent labyrinthectomy between 1978 and 1985. We remain impressed at the efficacy of the transmastoid labyrinthectomy in relieving the symptom of vertigo.\r"

Some anesthetic agents have been reported to alter the auditory evoked middle latency response. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of ketamine and xylazine anesthesia on the EMLR in guinea pigs. A consistent, reproducible, and significant depression in the EMLR was observed after anesthesia. Response latencies were increased and the suprathreshold amplitudes were depressed initially, but later increased above preanesthetic values. Changes followed a predictable time course of depression and overshoot, which allows the investigator to compensate for these effects of anesthesia. No change in threshold was observed. The lack of threshold change and the predictable course of suprathreshold depression indicates that the EMLR may be useful to evaluate responsiveness of the auditory system to electrical stimulation in the anesthetized animal.\r"

One of the major advantages of the use of vascularized bone over all other methods of mandibular reconstruction is its ability to achieve dental rehabilitation rapidly. The use of osseointegrated dental implants is a valuable adjunct in oral rehabilitation. It provides the most rigid form of stabilization to withstand the forces of mastication. In situations in which soft tissue reconstruction or the height of the alveolar ridge is not sufficient for a tissue-borne denture, implants offer the most suitable alternative. Mandibular reconstruction with free tissue transfer techniques is ideally suited for the placement of implants. These can be inserted at the time of mandibular reconstruction. Four months after surgery, when the integration process has occurred, the implants are unroofed, loaded, and ready for prosthetic placement. We will present several representative patients who underwent mandibular reconstruction with microvascular free bone transfer who have been successfully rehabilitated by osseointegrated implants. The process of osseointegration, different types of dental implants, and issues regarding radiation and implants are discussed. This is the first report of dental rehabilitation by primary placement of dental implants in patients undergoing microvascular mandibular reconstruction.\r"

Since that earlier report, continuous intraoperative electrical facial nerve monitoring has been used during the infratemporal approach in 20 additional cases. Immediate postoperative facial function was normal in 93% of the monitored cases and in 70% of the cases in the unmonitored group. More importantly, no patients in the monitored group developed grade V or VI weakness after surgery, whereas 48% of the unmonitored patients had grade V or VI weakness during the early postoperative period. This article will describe how intraoperative facial nerve monitoring is used during infratemporal surgery and will compare early facial function in 31 unmonitored patients with early facial function in 20 monitored procedures.\r"

  ".W": "The biomechanical effects on the cranial contents after craniectomy and immediate soft-tissue flap reconstruction are substantial and potentially life threatening. Once the rigid protective covering of the skull is removed, the cerebral component of the cranial contents is vulnerable to rising extrinsic pressure. Intracranial pressure falls, brain compliance rises, and contralateral cerebral shift may occur by virtue of the craniectomy alone. However, if flaps filling the defect should compress by weight or swelling, even greater midline or craniocaudal shift of the brain may occur. We present three cases in which midline cerebral shift was documented by CT scan after flap reconstruction of lateral craniofacial/craniotemporal resection. Three other patients undergoing anterior craniofacial resection during the same time period for skin cancer (one patient) and esthesioneuroblastoma (two patients) had no shift in intracerebral contents. Symptomatic or asymptomatic intracranial shift may occur soon after substantial craniectomy and soft-tissue flap reconstruction. Midline shift from lateral resection and reconstruction is more likely than anteroposterior shift from anterior craniofacial resection. Strategies for minimizing this compression or shift are described.\r"

Treatment of acquired angioedema is directed first at protecting the airway by careful observation, intubation, or if necessary, tracheostomy. The causative agent is withdrawn, and the patient is treated with antihistamines and steroids until the acute episode resolves. Although not used in our patients, the treatment of angioedema with subcutaneous epinephrine has been described.

Rural communities face unique health needs, necessitating access to local health care. Much has been written about the social, economic, legislative, and technological changes that have increased the stress on rural hospitals in the 1980s. However, quantifiable models have been lacking with which to examine in detail factors associated with rural hospitals and to correlate such factors with individual hospitals' risks of closing. In this study, we identify variables correlated with rural community hospital closures in the period 1980-87. Using epidemiologic case-control methods, 161 closed rural hospitals were matched 1 to 3 with a control group of 483 rural hospitals which remained open during the same period. A series of hospital performance indicators and demographic, economic, and social community variables were entered into a multiple logistic regression model. Four variables were found to be positively correlated with risk of closure. They are for-profit ownership; nongovernment, not-for-profit ownership; presence of a skilled nursing or other longterm care unit; and the number of other hospitals in the county. Variables negatively correlated with risk of closure were accreditation by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the number of facilities and services, and membership in a multihospital system. Policy and research implications at the Federal, State, and local levels are discussed.\r"

The degree of PCP abuse in a metropolitan area may be related to the availability and cost of other, more highly coveted drugs, such as crack cocaine.\r"

  ".W": "Home care for persons who require the prolonged use of life-supportive medical technology is a reality in several nations. France has had more than a quarter of a century of experience with providing home care for patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency and with a system to evaluate the patients' outcomes. The French approach features decentralized regional organizations which offer grassroots involvement by the beneficiaries who participate directly in the system. Since June 1981, a national organization has provided patients, professionals, and others concerned with direct access to national funding authorities and governmental officials and has created a data base for evaluation of the experience. This system permits direct input by current users of the services and creates informed opinion among members of the general public, governmental officials, and others involved (health care professionals and service providers). This is essential for the development of responsive public policy and for the determination of the relevancy of programs. In the United States, increasing demands are being made upon expensive hospital services by patients with diseases such as AIDS and other catastrophic, long-term care conditions. Cost-saving, community-oriented home care models serving complex medical-societal needs abroad are worthy of study to discern possible applications to health and social problems in our nation.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between the average cost of home health care and the case mix of patients served by the home health agency is investigated using 1983 data from Wisconsin's home health care agencies. In contrast to previous work, case mix is shown to have a significant effect on the home health agency's average costs. The methods used in the previous work are evaluated, and differences between the earlier study and the present study are discussed to explain the divergent results. Also, average costs are shown to decrease with output, to increase with the proportion of private patients served by the agency, and to be higher if the home health agency is located in an urban area or if it has a proprietary charter. The implications of this research for the design of an appropriate home health reimbursement policy are discussed. Primarily, it is argued that, although future research might confirm the relationship between average costs and case mix for home health agencies, we cannot necessarily conclude that reimbursement rates must be adjusted to account for differences in case mix as many States are now doing for nursing home reimbursement. Policies must take into account the fundamental differences between home health agencies and nursing homes, and their respective markets, in order to be effective.\r"

These habits (drinking moderately, exercising regularly, maintaining desirable weight for height, eating breakfast, not eating snacks, sleeping 7 or 8 hours per day, and never having smoked) were recently examined in a sample of the U.S. population. Subgroups with low income and little education were found to have low frequency of these health habits. In this report, findings on the frequency of these habits in 966 habitual runners in South Carolina are presented separately for men and women and according to age, education, income, and weekly mileage. Subgroups of the runners are surprisingly similar to subgroups of the national sample for several health habits. In addition, among the runners, low-income groups and those with little education have a lower frequency of good health habits relative to the other groups, although these differences are not statistically significant. Overall, about half of the runners practice five or more good health habits. These results indicate that even among healthy runners there is need for improvement in the adoption of health habits thought to be associated with reduced morbidity and mortality.\r"

A prospective study of deaths and hospitalizations attributable to pneumonia was conducted among 5,474 subjects ages 55 and older who participated in the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study. Prevalent chronic conditions, health behaviors, and nutritional status indicators, measured at baseline, were examined in relation to pneumonia hospitalization and death during 12 years of followup. Mortality and hospitalization rates for pneumonia were higher among men than women, and higher among those ages 65 and older than among those 55-64 of both sexes. Risk of pneumonia death was higher among subjects with a history of congestive heart failure, stroke, cancer, or diabetes. Risk of pneumonia hospitalization was higher among subjects with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and among men who were current smokers. Daily alcohol consumption did not increase risk of pneumonia in this study population. Four measures of nutritional status were examined taking age, prevalent chronic conditions, and cigarette smoking into account: body mass index, arm muscle area, and serum albumin and hemoglobin levels. Risk of pneumonia death was 2.6 times higher in men in the lowest quartile, compared with men in the highest quartile, of body mass index. Similarly, the risk was 4.5 times higher among men in the lowest quartile of arm muscle area. Risk of death from pneumonia was 3.6 times higher among women in the lowest quartile of serum albumin levels compared with women in the highest quartile. Relative risks for these nutritional status indicators remained elevated after adjusting for age and the medical history risk factors. These risk factors should be taken into account when designing and evaluating pneumonia vaccination trials and community prevention programs.\r"

The author and his colleagues recently established a service program at Wayne State University's Institute of Maternal and Child Health that employs IHCWs. Characterizations of IHCWs in previous health care programs were reviewed in the process of developing criteria and guidelines for the recruitment, selection, training, employing, and evaluating these workers in the Institute's program. The unique applicability of indigenousness to the delivery of health care services is addressed in terms of the rationale for the use of IHCWs as well as criteria for their success, benefits and problems encountered in the use of these workers, and deficiencies in evaluations of IHCWs. A model of program evaluation, action research, is proposed that assesses the processes and outcomes of providing health services by indigenous paraprofessionals.\r"

The majority of cases involved the birth of a live infant to an adolescent who had reportedly kept her pregnancy secret from family and friends. The death of the infants resulted from exposure or drowning. Efforts were made by the mother to hide or dispose of her infant's body. Basic information about each of the reported cases is presented, as well as the sentences given the adult mothers charged with the crime of child endangerment. The dynamics of these cases are reviewed in the context of earlier studies dealing with the phenomenon of neonaticide. Infanticide has deep roots in several cultures. It was practiced in some primitive societies and was decreed a capital offense as early as 1643. Its occurrence recently prompts suggestions for activities by professionals to prevent these tragedies. More research and further attention to this problem is warranted.\r"

The two groups were compared to each other and to all hospital births according to demographic characteristics of mothers, indicators of prenatal care, and birth outcome. Mothers who had planned their home birth were more likely to be primiparous, attend prenatal classes, obtain regular prenatal care from a physician, and have babies with a higher birth weight than either the unplanned or hospital group. Of particular concern, however, were the subset of unplanned home births who were primiparous. These mothers attended prenatal classes less frequently than any other group, reported the lowest number of physician visits, were youngest, and least likely to be married. In addition their babies averaged the shortest gestational age and the lowest birth weight. Findings in general show that planned and unplanned home births must be considered as heterogeneous groups in any comparison of risk factors and of birth outcome between home and hospital births. Further, within the unplanned group, multiparous women differ from primiparous women. Given the limitations inherent in this and similar studies, the apparent better outcome in the planned home birth group, as measured by birth weight, must be viewed with caution.\r"

Interview data from a study of chronically ill children in a northeastern inner city were collected using carefully translated measures of health and health-related behaviors. The psychometric properties of the scales were assessed across the subgroups to determine if common interpretation of the scales was possible. After determining that this was the case, group means in health and health-related variables were compared. Despite sociodemographic group differences in variables, there were remarkably few differences among the groups on traditional morbidity measures. However, significant differences were found on four of five scaled health-related measures (the impact of the child's illness on the family, the child's functional status, and the mental health of both mother and child). These findings did not all favor the same group, suggesting that certain areas of function may present more problems for some subgroups. These differences virtually all disappear when multivariate techniques are used to control for variation in important socioeconomic characteristics among the three subgroups. Statements that the health status of one subgroup is better than that of another are too simplistic if they do not indicate the particular aspect of health status being discussed and control for differences among the groups in maternal education, family structure, maternal welfare status, and similar background characteristics.\r"

A survey of the educational needs concerning injury prevention of a group of fifth and sixth grade children (ages 10-12) in Holliston, MA, revealed educational deficiencies, including bicycle safety, seatbelt use, firearms use, and water safety. It is well known that the use of helmets can prevent bicycle injuries. Yet, not one of the children in this study reported using a bicycle helmet. Although most States have laws requiring seatbelts for young children, school age children are not covered by this legislation. The hazards of firearms have been well-documented. But it is clear that the children surveyed were in need of education about firearms; nearly half had used some form of firearms. Individual counseling by pediatricians combined with school- and community-based programs can address injury prevention. It is anticipated that many pediatricians will begin using the questionnaire for school age children as that component of the American Academy of Pediatrics Injury Prevention Program is introduced.\r"

The results were examined in relation to age and education. The most accurate answers were given by respondents less than 45 years. In terms of educational attainment, respondents with less than a high school education had an average score of 61.4 and those with a college degree averaged 85.0. When the authors examined responses to individual questions, it became apparent that respondents were more knowledgeable about ways the virus could be transmitted than about ways it could not. A more comprehensive education program must reduce fear. One component of the current AIDS campaign in Vermont is an advertisement that addresses unfounded concern about casual transmission of AIDS.\r"

Much less is known about risk behavior patterns among gay men in smaller cities, where AIDS cases are less common and the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection is relatively lower. In the study, men entering gay bars in three cities, one large and two small, completed anonymous surveys of sexual practices and AIDS risk knowledge. Men in high AIDS-prevalence areas were found to have had a greater number of sexual partners, were more knowledgeable about AIDS, were much more likely to engage in low-risk practices (such as mutual masturbation or body rubbing), and had unprotected anal intercourse less frequently than gay men in smaller cities. The most common sexual activity among gay men in the larger city was mutual masturbation, a low-risk practice. The most common sexual activity among gay men in the smaller cities was unprotected anal intercourse. Increased efforts are needed to educate gay men and to promote risk behavior changes among those living in smaller cities and in communities outside the prominent AIDS epicenters.\r"

Ten of these individuals were AZT-intolerant. Eight dose regimens were studied. The drug was orally bioavailable and penetrated into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Comparatively little evidence of an effect against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was seen at the lowest four doses. However, patients in the four highest dose groups (ddI at 1.6 milligrams per kilogram intravenously and then greater than or equal to 3.2 milligrams per kilogram orally at least every 12 hours or higher) had increases in their circulating CD4+ T cells (P less than 0.0005), increased CD4/CD8 T cell ratios (P less than 0.01), and, where evaluable, more than an 80% decrease in serum HIV p24 antigen (P less than 0.05). The patients also had evidence of improved immunologic function, had reduced viremic symptomatology, and gained a mean of 1.6 kilogram with these comparatively infrequent dosing schedules (every 8 or 12 hours). The most notable adverse effects directly attributable to ddI administration at the doses used in this study included increases in serum uric acid (due to hypoxanthine release) and mild headaches and insomnia. These results suggest that serious short-term toxicity at therapeutic doses is not an inherent feature in the profile of agents with clinical anti-HIV activity. Further controlled studies to define the safety and efficacy of this agent may be worth considering.\r"

As would be predicted from the cDNA sequence, the LH-CG-R consists of a 26-residue signal peptide, a 341-residue extracellular domain displaying an internal repeat structure characteristic of members of the leucine-rich glycoprotein (LRG) family, and a 333-residue region containing seven transmembrane segments. This membrane-spanning region displays sequence similarity with all members of the G protein-coupled receptor family. Hence, the LH-CG-R gene may have evolved by recombination of LRG and G protein-coupled receptor genes. Cells engineered to express LH-CG-R cDNA bind human choriogonadotropin with high affinity and show an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate when exposed to hormone. As revealed by RNA blot analysis and in situ hybridization, the 4.4-kilobase cognate messenger RNA is prominently localized in the rat ovary.\r"

Hence, Gs can act on at least three effectors in the heart: sodium channels, calcium channels, and adenylyl cyclase. The effect on sodium currents was inhibitory and was enhanced by membrane depolarization. During myocardial ischemia the sodium currents of depolarized cells may be further inhibited by the accompanying increase in catecholamine levels.\r"

Fifty-four patients were randomly assigned to deprenyl (10 mg/day) or placebo treatment groups and followed until L-dopa therapy was indicated or until the patient had been in the study for 3 years. Analysis of Kaplan-Meier survival curves for each group showed that deprenyl delayed the need for L-dopa therapy; the average time until L-dopa was needed was 312.1 days for patients in the placebo group and 548.9 days for patients in the deprenyl group. Disease progression, as monitored by five different assessment scales, was slowed (by 40 to 83% per year) in the deprenyl group compared to placebo. Therefore, early deprenyl therapy delays the requirement for antiparkinsonian medication, possibly by slowing progression of the disease.\r"

The primary structure of the protein was deduced from the DNA sequence analysis; the protein contains 696 amino acids with a putative signal peptide of 27 amino acids. Hydropathy analysis suggests the existence of seven transmembrane domains that show homology with the corresponding regions of other G protein-coupled receptors. Three other types of clones corresponding to shorter proteins were observed, in which the putative transmembrane domain was absent. These probably arose through alternative splicing. RNA blot analysis showed similar patterns in testis and ovary with a major RNA of 4700 nucleotides and several minor species. The messenger RNA was expressed in COS-7 cells, yielding a protein that bound hCG with the same affinity as the testicular receptor.\r"

To test the hypothesis that this hypotensive response to nitroglycerin may be related to right ventricular (RV) involvement, we compared 20 patients with electrocardiographic and enzyme-documented inferior wall AMI and marked hypotension (greater than 30 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure, with symptoms) after nitrate administration, to 20 patients with documented inferior AMI, but without hypotension after administration of nitroglycerin. The presence of RV involvement was determined by electrocardiographic criteria of 1 mm of ST-segment elevation in at least 2 right precordial chest leads. Fifteen of the 20 patients who demonstrated a marked hypotensive response to nitroglycerin had evidence of RV involvement, while in 18 of the 20 patients without hypotension after nitrates there was no evidence of RV involvement. In a separate analysis of 28 patients with documented RV involvement in an inferior AMI, 20 developed hypotension in response to nitrates. Thus, in the setting of an inferior AMI, a marked hypotensive response to nitrates suggests the presence of RV involvement. Moreover, hypotension after nitrate administration may be anticipated in patients with known RV infarction, and in such patients, nitrates should be administered carefully.\r"

However, its value in symptomatic patients and its accuracy early after platelet injection are not satisfactorily established. The latter is important for timely institution of therapy. Accordingly, 65 patients (67 limbs) with suspected deep venous thrombosis (symptom duration 8 +/- 10 days, mean +/- standard deviation) were prospectively studied with platelet scintigraphy and contrast venography. Platelets were labeled with 405 +/- 101 mCi indium-111 oxine. The labeling efficiency was 80 +/- 10%. All images were acquired within 120 minutes after intravenous administration of the platelet suspension. Both platelet scintigraphy and venography were interpreted independently by 2 blinded observers (for each technique). Five separate analyses were performed. Each scintigraphic reader was compared to each venographic reader. A fifth analysis--consisting of readings with blinded agreement of both readings of the platelet scans and both readings of the venograms--was performed. Interobserver agreement was 92% for venography and 79% for scintigraphy. Excluding anticoagulated patients, the sensitivity of platelet scintigraphy was between 38 and 46% and the specificity was between 92 and 100%. Thus, early imaging of labeled platelets for the diagnosis of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis carries a high specificity but a much lower sensitivity. It is speculated that the low sensitivity is related to the inactivity of the thrombus. This may suggest that early imaging will only be useful in patients whose symptoms are of recent onset.\r"

The small intestinal mucosa was hypotrophic (protein-DNA ratio: 5.02 +/- 1.43 vs 8.82 +/- 0.68, malnourished vs controls, respectively) with reduced mucosal thickness, villus height, and crypt depth. Specific activities of lactase, maltase, and sucrase were diminished (53%, 66%, 54% of control values, respectively). Colonic mucosa was hypoplastic with decreased mucosal thickness and crypt depth. Liver and pancreas were both hypotrophic and hypoplastic.

Increase in body weight was 3.4 +/- 2.4 kg (means + SD), in height, 5.9 +/- 3.9 cm during the year. N balance remained positive throughout the study. Zn and Ca balances suggested that needs for this population may be greater than or equal to 150% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance. Vitamin D supplementation had no effect. Soy polysaccharide fiber intakes of 18-24 g/d compared with 0 or 12-20 g fiber/d significantly improved N and P retentions. Although the determination of nutrient needs of a severely disabled population is complex, our results suggest N and energy but not Zn and Ca allowances for a healthy population may be satisfactory guidelines.\r"

The histopathologic findings showed a spectrum of lymphoid and immunoblastic proliferation ranging from diffuse hyperplasia to malignant lymphoma, immunoblastic or large cell type. All cases were associated with a primary Epstein-Barr virus infection, and viral DNA was demonstrated within the lesional tissue in three cases. Immunohistochemical and immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies revealed a B-cell proliferation that was monoclonal in three cases and polyclonal in two cases. Compared with PTLDs arising in other organ transplant recipients, this series is remarkable for a high incidence of PTLDs (9.4%), a short interval to tumor diagnosis (2.2 months, mean), involvement of the primary allograft in three cases (60%), and the frequent development of bronchiolitis obliterans. Possible reasons for this distinct clinicopathologic profile are discussed.\r"

This article describes an automated assay for measuring the microbial inhibitory activity of transferrin in serum and its use in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and in normal controls. The assay measured the ability of heat-inactivated serum to inhibit the growth of an antibiotic-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The serum dilutions were prepared in a special low iron chemically defined broth. An inhibition index, the reciprocal of the serum dilution producing 50% inhibition of bacterial growth when compared with the growth in broth alone, was determined. The results showed the serum from the patients with leukemia had a significantly lower inhibition index than that of controls (16 +/- 11 vs. 35 +/- 13, P less than 0.01). In addition, they had higher serum iron levels (162 +/- 65 vs. 75 +/- 27, P less than 0.01), lower serum transferrin levels (231 +/- 65 vs. 309 +/- 71, P less than 0.01), and higher percentage saturation of transferrin with iron (59 +/- 21 vs. 20 +/- 8, P less than 0.01) than did controls. Because the assay uses equipment available in many clinical laboratories, it could be developed for routine use as an index of susceptibility to infection in selected patients.\r"

Immunoperoxidase staining of tumor tissue obtained from biopsy and at autopsy had positive results for IgM and lambda.

This case differs from the reported cases in the literature because atypical cells were observed in the bone marrow biopsy and marrow and peripheral blood smears that were obtained from the patient, a 61-year-old man, during the staging procedures. Lymphocyte surface marker studies on peripheral blood by flow cytometry and DNA analysis revealed a monoclonal population of lambda-positive lymphocytes. The immunophenotype of MBCL cells was studied both in paraffin-embedded lymph node sections by immunoperoxidase method and in peripheral blood by flow cytometric analysis; the cells expressed the SIg with lambda light chain restriction and the HLA-DR antigen; they also had positive results for B-cell-associated antigens, including LN1, LN2, CD 20, CD 22, CD 19, CD 9 but not CD 21, CD 24, and CD 10, T-cell-associated antigens and monocytic markers. In addition, they had negative results for CD 25, CD 38, PCA-1. This report emphasizes that in MBCL, peripheral and marrow involvement may occur at presentation analogous to other low-grade B-cell lymphomas. The immunophenotypic characteristics of MBCL cells, though not pathognomonic, are considered to be helpful in differentiating them from circulating cells of other B-cell lymphomas.\r"

Of 35 children who underwent surgical procedures for chronic sinusitis, 22 had positive bacteriologic cultures of aspirates from the sinus. The most common organisms isolated were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. Five of eight S pneumoniae strains were relatively resistant to penicillin and resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. All of the B catarrhalis and 20% of the H influenzae organisms were beta-lactamase positive. Overall, 14 of 28 of the bacteria were penicillin resistant. In addition, all 12 children 2 years of age or younger had a positive bacterial culture as compared with much lower rates in older children. Although the incidence of S pneumoniae strains that are relatively resistant seems to be rising, to our knowledge we report the first description of these organisms as significant pathogens in chronic childhood sinusitis. These results indicate that chronic, difficult to manage sinusitis in very young children is frequently bacterial in origin, especially if the patient is 2 years old or younger. In light of the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy and considering the incidence of relatively resistant S pneumoniae strains, puncture of the sinus should be considered early in the course of chronic sinusitis to isolate pathogenic organisms and determine appropriate antimicrobial therapy.\r"

Stimulation of polymorphonuclear cells with phorbol myristate acetate, the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, and the calcium ionophore A23187 resulted in significantly greater chemiluminescence responses from the cells of patients than from the control cells. The monocyte response of patients to opsonized zymosan was also greater than that of controls. Thus, phagocytic cells from adolescents and young adults with cystic fibrosis have a greater chemiluminescence response to a variety of stimuli. This may result in tissue damage in the lungs of these patients and thus make them more susceptible to pulmonary infections.\r"

One hundred twelve patients had unilateral cryptorchidism.

Fifty-one patients had bilateral cryptorchidism. Response by age group was as follows: 1 (16.6%) of 6 patients aged 1 to 2 years; 3 (27.2%) of 11 patients aged 3 to 4 years; 6 (37.5%) of 16 (plus unilateral descent in 1 patient) aged 5 to 6 years; and 10 (55.5%) of 18 patients aged 7 to 11 years. The results are comparable with those obtained with human chorionic gonadotropin treatment alone. A relapse rate of 9.7% after 18 months of follow-up seemed to be lower compared with those reported with treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone or treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin alone.\r"

Glutaraldehyde (0.8%) is as effective as 4% formaldehyde in its microbiocidal effect.

  ".W": "Gaucher disease (GD) is the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease. This autosomal recessive trait results from the defective activity of acid beta-glucosidase (beta-Glc). Four different exonic point mutations have been identified as causal alleles for GD. To facilitate screening for these alleles, assays were developed using allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to amplified genomic DNA sequences. Specifically, intron bases flanking exons 5, 9, and 10 were determined, and conditions for PCR amplification of these exons were obtained. Two different procedures were developed to distinguish signals obtained from the structural beta-Glc gene exons and those from the pseudogene. These procedures were used to determine the distribution of all known GD alleles in a population of 44 affected patients of varying phenotypes and ethnicity. The high frequency of one of the exon 9 mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish GD type 1 patients was confirmed, and, in addition, this mutation was present in ethnically diverse non-Jewish type 1 GD patients. Homozygotes (N = 5) for this allele were midly affected older individuals, and this mutant allele was not found in any patient with neuronopathic disease. The exon 10 mutation was confirmed as the predominant allele in types 2 and 3 GD. However, several type 1 GD patients, including one of Ashkenazi-Jewish heritage, also were heterozygous for this allele. The presence of this allele in type 1 patients did not correlate with the severity of clinical symptoms. The second exon 9 mutation and the exon 5 mutation were rare, since they occurred only heterozygously either in one type 2 GD patient or in two related Ashkenazi-Jewish GD patients, respectively. Although most GD patients (38 of 44) had at least one of the known mutant alleles, 57% were heterozygotes for only one of these mutations. Fourteen percent of patients were negative for all mutations. A total of 73% of GD patients had at least one unknown allele. The varying clinical phenotypes and ethnic origins of these incompletely characterized patients suggest that multiple other GD alleles exist.\r"

  ".W": "Generally, if mutant and normal proteins have similar molecular weights and electric charges, they cannot easily be distinguished from one another. We have developed a unique method by which a mutant enzyme of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) can easily be distinguished from normal enzyme with nearly identical molecular weight and electric charge. DNA sequencing data have suggested that in this special type of disease (Japanese-type APRT deficiency) there is an amino acid substitution from Met to Thr at position 136 of APRT. Since normal APRT has only one Met residue, the Japanese-type mutant APRT should be a methionine-free protein. Using both an amino acid sequence-specific antiserum against APRT, and specific cleavage of peptide at the methionine residue with BrCN, we could distinguish between normal and mutant proteins. Thus, normal but not mutant APRT was cleaved with BrCN, indicating that the mutant APRT is a methionine-free protein. All tested patients with the Japanese-type APRT deficiency were found to synthesize exclusively methionine-free APRT. Usefulness of this method is not restricted to a single family, as 79% of all the patients with this disease among Japanese, and more than half of all the patients with this disease reported in the world, are likely to have this unique mutation. Thus, not only sequence-specific cleavage of DNA with restriction endonucleases but also that of protein with a chemical agent has been shown to be sometimes useful for the diagnosis and analysis of a genetic disease by careful examination of normal and mutant amino acid sequences.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Commercially available enteral formulas frequently cause hyperglycemia. This often leads to difficult and complex diabetes management with glucosuria and urinary losses of calories, fluid, and electrolytes. In this study, we compared a new product, EN-8715 (8% soluble fiber, 18% Polycose, 7% fructose, 50% fat, 17% protein), with a standard feeding product, Ensure HN (53% simple carbohydrates, 30% fat, 17% protein), to determine whether the new product would lower the glucose response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten subjects (four women and six men) with type I diabetes were evaluated in paired, simulated tube feeding studies. After an overnight fast, a Biostator (artificial endocrine pancreas) was attached to each subject, and a steady-state blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL (8.4 mM) was established. The Biostator was then programmed to deliver a small basal amount of insulin (0.1 mU/kg/minute [718 pmol/kg/minute]), and the patients were given 20 mL of the randomly assigned formula every 15 minutes for 240 minutes (320 mL). Counterregulatory hormone responses to bringing the initial glucose response to the two enteral feeding formulas were measured and compared. RESULTS: The glucose response (mg/dL/four hours +/- SEM) essentially did not rise after EN-8715 (-2 +/- 33 mg/dL/four hours [-0.11 +/- 1.83 mM/four hours]) compared with that for Ensure HN (190 +/- 32 mg/dL/four hours [10.64 +/- 1.79 mM/four hours]). Urinary glucose losses (g +/- SEM) were significantly (p = 0.01) less after the new product (1.4 +/- 0.6 g [7.8 +/- 3.3 mmol] versus 5.7 +/- 1.5 g [30.2 +/- 8.3 mmol]). There were no significant differences in counterregulatory hormone responses. Side effects were minimal and product acceptance was similar. CONCLUSION: A low-carbohydrate, fiber-containing enteral feeding formula can limit hyperglycemia in patients with type I diabetes.\r"

The pupillary block was associated with increased intraocular pressure in six patients. Tissue plasminogen activator was injected via the corneoscleral limbus in five patients and via the pars plana in two patients. In all patients, injection of tissue plasminogen activator resulted in complete fibrinolysis of the fibrin pupillary membrane within four hours, associated with a deepening of the anterior chamber. In the six patients with increased intraocular pressure at the time of tissue plasminogen activator injection, dissolution of the fibrin membrane was associated with a decrease in pressure. In all patients, intraocular pressure had returned to normal by three days after the injection. No complications were associated with the injection.\r"

To investigate genomic tumor cell heterogeneity, 50 biopsies of 21 patients with B-LPD of different histogenetic origin were studied for changes in the immunoglobulin gene structure during follow-up study. Ig-heavy chain (IgH) gene alterations were analyzed by Southern blotting using a panel of eight endonucleases. Ig-light chain (IgL) genes and the translocation of the bc 1-2 gene involved in t(14;18) were also studied. In seven of nine follicular lymphomas, most alterations suggested mutations in the IgH genes. Conservation of most restriction sites and of the t(14; 18) breakpoint confirmed the monoclonal origin in these tumors. Also, in two of three diffuse follicle center cell lymphomas (CLL) and in each of four immunocytomas, IgH alterations were found. In contrast, clonal changes were absent in three centrocytic lymphomas and two cases of CLL. In two follicular lymphomas with bitypic IgL expression, a common origin with subsequent divergence of the two constituents, rather than true biclonality, was indicated by the Ig gene structures. No relation was found between the frequency of somatic mutations and histologic signs of progression. These data indicate that somatic hypermutation in IgH genes is related to the histogenesis of the B-LPD and reflect the physiology of their benign counterparts in normal B cell development.\r"

A major component of the plaque core is a 4.2 kd polypeptide, amyloid beta-protein (ABP), which is derived from the C-terminus of a larger precursor protein (ABPP). The authors have studied the transcription of ABPP mRNA in the adult rat brain by Northern analysis and in situ hybridization, and report that the ABPP gene gives rise to essentially the same multitranscript family of mRNAs as in the human, and that differential transcription patterns exist between brain and kidney. Morphologically, ABPP mRNA is expressed ubiquitously in neurons of the fore and hindbrain. ABPP transcripts also are present less frequently in occasional glial cells and at moderate to low frequency in nonneural cell types, namely, the choroid plexus epithelium, ependymal cells, and leptomeningeal membranes. Neuronal transcripts are most abundant in cerebral cortical layers II and V, the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, the olfactory cortex, nucleus basis pontis, cranial nerve nuclei, and, significantly, in Purkinje cells and cerebellar granule cells. Because the cerebellum is relatively uninvolved in Alzheimer's disease, these findings suggest that high intraneuronal expression of ABPP may be a necessary but not sufficient requirement for plaque formation.\r"

The tau component was identified both in senile and kuru plaques. In AD, tau-positive senile plaques were found in all cerebral cortices of almost all cases, and the tau-positivity of plaques in cerebral cortices was 5.1 to 27.5%. In CJD, tau-positive senile and kuru plaques were restricted to the hippocampus, and the tau-positivity was 4.3 and 1.2%, respectively. In nondemented aged controls, tau-positive senile plaques also were restricted mostly to the hippocampus, and the tau-positivity was 1.3%. Significant differences in the tau-positivity of senile plaques were found between AD and CJD and nondemented aged controls, and no significant differences were found between CJD and nondemented aged controls. These observations are important because increased tau accumulation in senile plaques can be a hallmark of AD.\r"

The amounts of alfentanil supplementing a standardized continuous infusion, injected to maintain hemodynamic stability, were statistically identical between the groups (P = 0.23). The amount of droperidol, however, was significantly less (P = 0.004) in the group of patients that received clonidine. The norepinephrine plasma concentrations, during the entire procedure, were lower (P = 0.001) in the clonidine group. The variability of the heart rate, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure recorded every 5 s, and assessed by the calculation of the coefficients of variation for each patient, showed no difference between the clonidine and the placebo group. However, when the values recorded were compared to the preoperative baseline values, and divided into three categories (baseline +/- 20%--greater than 20% decrease vs. baseline--greater than 20% increase vs. baseline), the clonidine group showed a higher frequency of low heart rate and fewer episodes of tachycardia. The frequency of SBP hypertension was lower and of SBP hypotension higher in the clonidine group. After induction of anesthesia, but before surgery, there were more episodes of DBP hypotension in the clonidine group, but during dissection and vascular sutures the placebo group experienced more episodes of DBP hypotension, owing probably to the greater amount of droperidol injected. The authors conclude that the preoperative administration of clonidine decreased the need to supplement anesthetic, and modifies the profile of distribution of heart rate and blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "The highly-selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine (D-MED) is capable of inducing muscle flaccidity and anesthesia in rats and dogs. Intense generalized muscle rigidity is an undesirable side effect of potent opiate agonists. Although the neurochemistry of opiate-induced rigidity has yet to be fully elucidated, recent work suggests a role for a central adrenergic mechanism. In the present study, the authors determined if treatment with D-MED prevents the muscle rigidity caused by high-dose alfentanil anesthesia in the rat. Animals (n = 42) were treated intraperitoneally with one of the following six regimens: 1) L-MED (the inactive L-isomer of medetomidine), 30 micrograms/kg; 2) D-MED, 10 micrograms/kg; 3) D-MED, 30 micrograms/kg; 4) D-MED [30 micrograms/kg] and the central-acting alpha-2 antagonist, idazoxan [10 mg/kg]; 5) D-MED [30 micrograms/kg] and the peripheral-acting alpha-2 antagonist DG-5128 [10 mg/kg], or; 6) saline. Baseline electromyographic activity was recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle before and after drug treatment. Each rat was then injected with alfentanil (ALF, 0.5 mg/kg sc). ALF injection resulted in a marked increase in hindlimb EMG activity in the L-MED treatment group which was indistinguishable from that seen in animals treated with saline. In contrast, D-MED prevented alfentanil-induced muscle rigidity in a dose-dependent fashion. The small EMG values obtained in the high-dose D-MED group were comparable with those recorded in earlier studies from control animals not given any opiate. The high-dose D-MED animals were flaccid, akinetic, and lacked a startle response during the entire experimental period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Interposed abdominal compression CPR (IAC-CPR) has been demonstrated to significantly improve blood flow compared with standard (S)-CPR in animal and electrical models. Studies with IAC-CPR in human beings have not reported data regarding cardiac output. Animal and clinical studies have correlated end-tidal PCO2 (ETPCO2) with cardiac output produced with precordial compressions. We conducted a prospective, randomized study on 33 adult patients with nontraumatic cardiac arrest. Patients were randomized to initially receive either S-CPR or IAC-CPR. ETPCO2 was monitored continuously. After 20 minutes of resuscitation, the technique was reversed. The average ETPCO2 during IAC-CPR was 17.1 mm Hg while the average during S-CPR was 9.6 mm Hg, a difference of 78% (P less than .001). In patients arriving in cardiac arrest, return of spontaneous circulation was observed in six patients (30%) during IAC-CPR and in one patient (6%) during S-CPR (P = .07). Our study strongly suggests that cardiac output may be significantly increased in human beings with IAC-CPR as evidenced by the significantly greater increases in ETPCO2 with IAC-CPR compared with S-CPR. In addition, IAC-CPR appeared to demonstrate a trend toward increasing the return of spontaneous circulation.\r"

Uninfected full-thickness, mucosal-only, or through-and-through wounds presenting within 24 hours of injury were considered. Management consisted of cleansing, irrigation, debridement, and closure as indicated: no topical antibiotics were applied. Patients were randomly assigned to receive penicillin VK 500 mg or identically appearing placebo four times daily for five days. Home wound care was standardized and patients were followed for a minimum of four or five days. Infection was assessed clinically. Seventy-six patients were enrolled and 62 completed the study. Penicillin (30) and placebo (32) groups were similar in all parameters except wound etiology; assault was more common in the placebo group (P = .02). Two infections occurred in patients receiving penicillin, and six infections were seen among placebo-treated patients (P = .05, beta = 0.17). When patients poorly compliant with therapy were eliminated from analysis, none of the penicillin-treated patients and five of the placebo-treated patients developed infections (P = .027). Our data suggest that patients with intraoral wounds may benefit from prophylactic penicillin if compliant with their therapy. More studies are needed to further delineate the usefulness of prophylactic antibiotics for these wounds.\r"

DESIGN: Nonrandomized, prospective phase II trial. Patients: Forty-seven patients with drug-refractory epithelial ovarian cancer who had one or more lesions measurable in perpendicular diameters. Of these patients, 45 were evaluable for toxicity and 40 were evaluable for response. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated every 22 days with varying doses of taxol (110 to 250 mg/m2 body surface) given as a 24-hour infusion with subsequent doses based on adverse effects. A premedication regimen was used to avoid acute hypersensitivity reactions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twelve patients (30%; CI, 16% to 44%) responded to taxol for periods lasting from 3 to 15 months. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression with leukocytes affected more severely and commonly than thrombocytes or reticulocytes. Leukopenia was usually brief in duration but was associated with sepsis in 3 cases (2 fatal). Other adverse effects included myalgias, arthralgias, alopecia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, and peripheral neuropathy. Rare cases of cardiac and central neurotoxicity were also noted. CONCLUSIONS: Taxol is an active agent in drug-refractory ovarian cancer and deserves further study in combination with other active drugs in previously untreated patients with advanced ovarian cancer.\r"

The new health care environment, with more prospective-payment and managed-care systems and less fee-for-service payment for both physicians and hospitals, has made physicians and hospitals mutually dependent. A hospital's long-term financial viability is now dependent largely on the practice style of its physicians. The Department of Internal Medicine at The University of Michigan has developed a new clinical management system called the Integrated Inpatient Management Model (IIMM). This new system includes a major revision of the hospital organization structure, new administrative information systems, and new clinical information systems. Physicians in the Department of Internal Medicine have assumed for the first time formal organizational responsibility for many aspects of the operations of the inpatient medical service. The IIMM represents a prototype of a system that we believe offers considerable promise for involving physicians to a much greater extent in the management of the nation's hospitals. We hope that describing the system in detail will facilitate the development of other systems for the management of the inpatient practice of internal medicine.\r"

Patients used topical mupirocin applied three times daily or the usual oral dose of erythromycin ethylsuccinate (30 to 50 mg/kg per day). Patients' lesions were examined clinically and cultured bacteriologically on days 0, 3, and 8, and 1 week after treatment. Susceptibility testing was performed on pathogens isolated to determine antibiotic resistance. Mupirocin treatment produced similar clinical results to oral erythromycin and was superior in the eradication of S aureus, including antibiotic-resistant S aureus.

No significant difference was observed between the K in normal dogs (0.19 +/- 0.08; n = 6) and that in dogs with PBO (0.24 +/- 0.06; n = 5) or CBO (0.21 +/- 0.03; n = 4). There was no significant difference in uptake of radiolabel by the liver among the three groups of dogs. In our model, biliary obstruction had no effect on hepatic RES function and may not represent a significant determinant of mortality in patients with obstructive jaundice.\r"

Significant differences were evident in the amount absorbed, maximum serum concentration, and time to achieve maximum serum concentration between the oral and rectal formulations. Mean absorption after rectal suppository was 80%. Maximum serum concentration was 43.4 mg/L after oral administration and 29.2 mg/L after rectal suppository. The time to achieve maximum serum concentration was 1.0 hour after oral syrup and 3.1 hours after rectal suppository. Absorption of the rectal suppository was consistent and complete within 3 hours. The use of valproate sodium in rectal suppository form can be a more convenient and satisfactory method of administering valproic acid when the oral route is impossible. Dosage increases may be necessary, and serum concentrations should be monitored.\r"

High dietary fructose consumption induced hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia, and increased the systolic blood pressure by 19 +/- 4 mm Hg (four weeks of diet) and 24 +/- 1 mm Hg (seven weeks of diet), respectively. There were no significant changes in the plasma renin activity at either time. However, an increase in plasma atrial natriuretic factor was noted in rats treated with a high fructose diet for four weeks, and a decrease in plasma aldosterone was found in those rats fed with fructose for a longer period. There was no significant difference in body weight gain between rats fed with fructose-enriched diet and those fed with control diet.

Ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ influx into the red blood cells (RBC) obtained from a healthy subject, and incubated with the plasma obtained during the high sodium diet was significantly lower than that incubated with the plasma obtained during the low sodium diet (3.74 +/- 0.26 v 3.97 +/- 0.30 nmol/10(8) cells, P less than .05). The changes in mean blood pressure from the high to low sodium diet showed a significant positive correlation with the changes in the ouabain-sensitive Rb influx into RBC in the plasma from the high to low sodium diet.

In this study we examined Na,K-ATPase activity in proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) cells and medullary thick ascending limb of Henle cells (TAL) from MHS and from the Milan normotensive rats (MNS). Na,K-ATPase activity was determined as 32P-ATP hydrolysis in single tubule segments. Na,K-ATPase activity (pmol Pi/mm t/h) was significantly higher in MHS than MNS both in PCT (903 +/- 227 n = 8 v 506 +/- 285 n = 12) and TAL (4324 +/- 800 n = 5 v 3063 +/- 625 n = 5). Na,K-ATPase dependent respiration was determined in PCT cell from MNS and MHS. Under basal condition Na,K-ATPase dependent respiration (mumol O2/mg protein/h) was higher in MHS than in MNS (24.2 +/- 1.8 n = 5 v 16.1 +/- 0.4 n = 5). When the cells were Na loaded by amphotericin Na,K-ATPase dependent respiration increased significantly more in MHS than MNS (38.4 +/- 1.6 v 26.8 +/- 2.2 n = 4). Thus, Na,K-ATPase activity is higher in renal tubule cells both at normal intracellular Na and after the cells have been Na loaded. The results indicate that regulation of Na homeostasis in renal tubule cell is different in MHS and MNS.\r"

  ".W": "We followed atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels in 12 patients during anticoagulant treatment of pulmonary embolism. In each patient with this disorder ANP decreased during treatment. Concomitantly, plasma renin activity (PRA) markedly rose. The decrease in ANP was significantly related to the rise in PRA. No consistent changes in ANP or in PRA were observed in five patients with peripheral venous thrombosis receiving the same anticoagulant treatment. Plasma aldosterone levels did not change in either group.\r"

  ".W": "Extensive examination in the mammalian brain for the presence of atrial natriuretic factors (ANF) has revealed both peptide and receptors specifically distributed throughout the central nervous system. High concentrations of ANF have been found in several hypothalamic nuclei, septal areas, the anteroventral third ventricular area (AV3V), and the median eminence, whereas moderate concentrations have been detected in the circumventricular organs and several brainstem nuclei. The receptors for ANF have been found in moderate to high concentrations in the olfactory lobe, AV3V region, and several circumventricular organs (subfornical organ, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis) as well as the nucleus tractus solitarius, median eminence, and choroid plexus. These findings suggest a role for ANF in modulating fluid and electrolyte balance, and blood pressure in this compartment, analogous to the proposed actions of this peptide hormone in the periphery. To determine whether ANF might function as a neuromodulator of blood pressure, we administered ANF via fourth ventricular injection into the brain of hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive rats (WKY). Atrial natriuretic factor caused a moderate and significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure in both strains. The action of ANF appeared to be mediated by activating the central alpha 2-adrenergic nervous system, probably through the release of catecholamines. Further, a dependence on the secretion and action of an endogenous opioid was probably involved; heart rate was unaffected in these studies. Experiments from other laboratories indicate that central ANF may modulate the pressor effects of centrally acting angiotensin II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
