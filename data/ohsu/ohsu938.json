  ".W": "Ninety-seven surgically excised natural cardiac valves were examined by scanning electron microscopy and x-ray energy spectroscopy to assess the occurrence of crystalline deposits that contain the element silicon. Valves examined included 33 mitral valves, 63 aortic valves, and 1 tricuspid valve. To reduce the possibility of surface contamination, the deep layers of some valves were examined after exposure by fracture of the valve. Crystalline material containing silicon was observed in the deep tissue. Such crystalline material was sometimes entwined within subendothelial fibers. Crystalline deposits that contained silicon were associated with 34 of 97 of these valves (35%). Among the 34 valves that showed silicon, 24 (71%) also showed microdeposits of calcific material. In view of evidence that silicon may participate in the calcification of bone, and is found in the intima of arteries, a role for this element in ectopic calcification of valves may exist.\r"

  ".W": "Fasting increases susceptibility to hyperoxic lung damage in mice, at least in part, by decreasing lung glutathione level. To determine whether fasting alters other components of the glutathione redox cycle, and whether a diet of sugar alone reverses fasting's effects, normally fed, sugar-fed, and fasted mice were exposed to room air or 100% oxygen for up to 4 days. In air-exposed mice, fasting decreased glutathione peroxidase (GP) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities 15% to 20% on days 3 and 4 (p less than 0.01) and glutathione level 25% to 30% on days 2 to 4 (p less than 0.05). When corrected for protein concentration, GP and GR values were similar to those in the fed mice, but glutathione levels remained lower on days 2 and 3 (p less than 0.05). Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was unchanged, but the ratio of GSSG to total glutathione (reduced glutathione plus GSSG) increased on day 2 (p less than 0.05). In oxygen-exposed fed mice, GP increased 62% and GR increased 39% on day 4 (p less than 0.05), the time when the lung injury was most severe; glutathione increased 30% on days 3 and 4 (p less than 0.05); and GSSG increased threefold and eightfold on days 3 and 4 (p less than 0.01). Oxygen-exposed fasted mice were all dead by day 3 (versus no deaths in the fed mice), failed to increase GR and total glutathione in response to the oxidant stress, and increased GP and GSSG on day 3 to the same extent as the fed mice did on day 4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Patients with cystic fibrosis frequently have pulmonary colonization with Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) and develop anti-Af immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgG antibodies. The diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in subjects with cystic fibrosis is difficult because of the high incidence of Af colonization, with development of humoral antibody responses. In this study, we sequentially measured serum anti-Af IgE (Af-E) and IgG (Af-G) antibodies by ELISA in subjects with cystic fibrosis. In subjects with cystic fibrosis who have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, Af-E and Af-G antibodies were significantly increased when compared with other groups of patients with cystic fibrosis who had positive skin tests or precipitins to Af (or both) (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively). In addition, increased Af-E and Af-G levels were sometimes seen in other groups, especially subjects with cystic fibrosis who had positive Af skin tests or precipitin tests, two of whom later developed criteria diagnostic of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Thus, serum Af-E and Af-G levels were quantitatively increased in subjects with cystic fibrosis who had allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and thus adjunctive data in diagnosis. However, it also suggested that subclinical pulmonary inflammation may also occur.\r"

  ".W": "The tobacco industry proposes to release a \"new\" cigarette with a burning charcoal tip, which heats the tobacco as air is drawn through it and into the lungs of the smoker. It is claimed to be safer because the tobacco does not burn. Using our established canine model of coronary artery stenosis with moderate intimal damage, we compared this new cigarette (0.4 mg nicotine) with a regular cigarette by ventilating dogs (n = 10) with room air and then either new or regular smoke (two cigarettes over about 10 minutes). In our dog model, periodic acute platelet thrombus formation followed by embolization produced cyclical flow reductions in coronary blood flow where the rate of flow decline was proportional to the degree of in vivo platelet-vessel wall interaction. The rate of flow decline increased from -4.81 +/- 1.29 ml/min2 to -9.60 +/- 2.29 ml/min2 after ventilation with the new-type smoke (p less than 0.01). Similarly, the rate of flow decline increased from -5.43 +/- 1.28 ml/min2 to -9.28 +/- 2.31 ml/min2 after ventilation with regular cigarette smoke (p less than 0.01). Despite the lack of a clear causal link between cigarette smoking and the acute manifestations of cardiovascular disease, the data presented here indicate that the new cigarette is just as potent as regular cigarettes at increasing in vivo platelet activity and exacerbating acute platelet thrombus formation in the dog. We conclude that the new proposed non-tobacco-burning cigarette has deleterious effects similar to those of conventional cigarettes, and thus does not eliminate smoking as a risk factor in cardiovascular disease in human beings.\r"

The mean area of the mastoid air cell system was measured planimetrically on X-rays and the data analysed according to age and sex. It was 12.05 +/- 0.67 cm2 in males and 11.45 +/- 0.70 cm2 in females (which are more or less the same as that of Western people). The size of the cranial bones has no apparent role in the size variation of the mastoid air cell system. The development of the latter was very rapid up to 10 years of age in both sexes and it continued even after 20 years of age but at a much slower rate.\r"

The results are presented of a trial in which the Goode T-tube was compared with the Armstrong tube. Fifteen children were treated between 1981 and 1986 with a T-tube in one ear and a conventional tube in the other. The results are different with regard to duration of stay in the tympanic membrane. Re-insertions were necessary in 47 per cent in the Armstrong group and in 20 per cent in the T-tube group. Otorrhoea occurred in 20 per cent of the Armstrong and 13 per cent of the T-tube intubated ears. A persistent perforation was present in 6 per cent of the ears in both groups. It is concluded that the Goode T-tube is indicated primarily in cases when long-term ventilation is needed.\r"

The results of the study showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the two methods in either controlling the epistaxis or in the incidence of complications.

The main parameters analyzed included histological diagnosis (no difference emerged among the three age groups); anatomical site (hypopharyngeal carcinoma was most frequent in non-elderly patients); TNM stage (an higher incidence of early stages was seen in the elderly); performance status (better in the non-elderly); previous illnesses (life-style related diseases were more frequent in the non-elderly); contraindications to surgery (more frequent in the elderly); surgical treatment ('en bloc' resections were more often employed in the non-elderly); post-operative complications and local control (no difference between the three groups); multiple primary malignancies (head and neck, oesophagus and lung were more frequent in non-elderly patients) and survival (no difference). Although age affects several features of head and neck cancer patients, it does not appear from the present study to be an independent prognostic factor for local control and survival.

No such decline was found among the Ashkenazi children and no consanguinity among parents of these children was recorded. Our study supports the assumption that restriction of consanguineous matings may affect the prevalence of genetic deafness in children in a well-defined population. We have tried to remain unbiased and concede certain shortcomings in our present study.\r"

This study compared the incidence of balance related problems in 154 children with surgically proven glue ear and 51 children with normal ear function. Symptoms ranging from true vertigo to mild ataxia were discovered in 22 per cent of the children with NSOM but in none of those within the control group (p less than 0.001). Periods of dysequilibrium were associated with episodes of otalgia in 64 per cent of the children but were not increased in those with unilateral compared to those with bilateral effusions. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred in 85 per cent of children following the insertion of grommets. A history of balance disturbance should be actively sought in all children with otitis media with effusion, and when present, provides a strong indication for early operative intervention.\r"

Mean observation time was 11.2 years (range 3-20.2 years), with a follow-up rate 86 per cent. Among 64 patients with stapes fixation, 59 had removal of tympanosclerotic masses and stapes mobilization, and five cases underwent stapedectomy. The series was divided into six groups and the results analyzed. The best and most stable results occurred in the group with stapes mobilization and an intact ossicular chain followed by the group with stapes mobilization and Type II tympanoplasty with incus interposition. The poorest late results were obtained in ears with lacking stapes crura and stapes mobilization, and in ears subjected to stapedectomy. No case of post-operative sensorineural hearing loss occurred. We recommend that care is taken to preserve an intact ossicular chain at stapes mobilization performed at the same stage as myringoplasty. Also in ears with a defective ossicular chain but intact stapes with tympanosclerotic fixation we recommend stapes mobilization in one stage. In ears with fixation of the stapes footplate and defective crura, we recommend stapedectomy or stapedotomy in two stages.\r"

Both were caused by Epstein-Barr Virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorder. The third patient, a 32-year-old female, had a presumed low grade T-cell lymphoma that regressed spontaneously. Histopathological diagnosis of these lympho-proliferative disorders after transplantation usually requires immunocytochemistry to distinguish polyclonal proliferative disorders from true lymphoma. Polyclonal lymphoproliferative disorders after transplantation do not usually require aggressive cytoreductive therapy, but respond to simple measures such as the reduction of immunosuppression.\r"

For patients seen once, acceptance rates for procedures were generally comparable to prior published performance rates for highly selected patient populations. Integration of a simple health maintenance protocol into routine office care of unselected primary care patients was feasible, effective, and acceptable to patients. Patient refusal was a minor barrier to performance of health maintenance.\r"

This study demonstrated the feasibility of measuring microalbuminuria in diabetic patients from a large family practice population. Although only one half of the 473 diabetic patients offered free screening took advantage of the testing, those participating did not differ in terms of sex, race, type of diabetes, mean age, systolic blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose levels from those not electing to participate. Over 40% of those screened had abnormally elevated albumin excretion rates as defined as greater than 0.02 g of albumin per gram of creatinine. Those participating in the screening perceived the process as useful and were able to comply with directions for overnight urine collection. Results show that screening for microalbuminuria in diabetic patients cared for by family physicians is feasible, simple, and inexpensive. Interventions to slow or reverse the progression of abnormal microalbuminuria and future risk for nephropathy in those with diabetes are underway.\r"

A retrospective audit of medical records and a prospective survey of residents and faculty were performed. From the medical records of 400 patients seen for health maintenance examinations, the frequency of tetanus-diphtheria immunizations recorded was 4.75%. The pooled immunization rate recorded for pneumococcal vaccine was 25%, and for influenza vaccine, 24%. Although 93% of respondents knew patients need tetanus-diphtheria immunization every 10 years, on a written questionnaire giving clinical examples, they were less likely to elect to immunize older patients eligible for tetanus-diphtheria vaccine. The following immunization criteria were listed by respondents: for pneumococcal vaccine, age over 65 years (86%); for influenza vaccine, age over 65 years (85%), chronic diseases (69%), residence in a chronic care facility (7%), and being a health care worker (28%). Educational interventions stressing the appropriate criteria and involvement of the patient are planned at the separate programs.\r"

Patient education materials and forms from each clinic were analyzed for readability using a standard computer program. A large discrepancy was found between the average patient reading comprehension and the ability levels needed to read patient education materials. The average reading comprehension of public clinic patients was 6th grade 5th month. Most tested patient education materials required a reading level of 11th to 14th grade, and standard institutional consent forms required a college-level reading comprehension. In the public clinics there was a gap of more than 5 years between patient reading levels and the comprehension levels required by written patient materials.\r"

Out of these cases, 172 autopsies were of individuals with no known risk factors for HIV infection, and of these, 169 had no detectable antibodies to HIV. In 2 cases, the serum reacted with p24 alone on the RIBA-HIV216 assay, but these results were not confirmed by further testing and are considered to be false positive reactions. In 1 case, the serum reacted only with gp41 on the RIBA-HIV216 test but was nonreactive with further testing. This result has been designated equivocal. Of the 35 cases at high risk of HIV infection, 4 had antibodies to HIV detected in postmortem serum samples. The sensitivity (100%) and specificity (98.5%) of the RIBA-HIV216 test system are high. However, the test appears to be more suitable for routine diagnosis of HIV infection than for rapid screening in the mortuary.\r"

  ".W": "A comprehensive epidemiological study of the involvement of cannabis and ethanol in motor vehicle fatalities in the Province of Ontario, Canada, is described. The study is based on toxicological analyses of blood and, when available, urine specimens. Ethanol was determined by headspace gas chromatography (GC). For cannabis, the methods employed were radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for screening and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for the determination of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in blood. The study sample consisted of 1169 drivers and 225 pedestrians. THC was detected in the blood of 127 driver victims (10.9%) in concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 37 ng/mL, with a mean of 3.1 +/- 5.0 ng/mL. Ethanol was found in 667 driver victims (57.1%), in concentrations ranging from 9 to 441 mg/100 mL, with a mean of 165.8 +/- 79.5 mg/100 mL. For pedestrians, the incidence of THC and ethanol in the blood was 7.6 and 53.3%, respectively. The incidence of THC in the driver victims in this study constitutes an approximately threefold increase over the results of an Ontario study completed in 1979. At least a part of the increase may be attributed to interstudy differences in analytical methodology for cannabinoids.\r"

These sensitized cells can be used in forensic science when detection or quantitation of erythrocyte surface reacting antibodies is important. The effect of altering membrane lipid fluidity on erythrocyte surface antigens has also been investigated.

The site of a positive reaction is clearly visible as a brown spot. We analyzed 521 samples and got satisfactory results. We also analyzed 99 practical case samples by this method and achieved the same results as those obtained by other researchers using other methods. This method is accurate, simple, direct, rapid, and sensitive; it also produces easily observed results, requires no equipment, and can be completed in 30 min. The test proved to be clearly more sensitive for the detection of the ABO blood group in secretor saliva than the conventional hemagglutination inhibition test. Also saliva diluted 10(-4) to 10(-5) and the ABO group of nonsecretor saliva and urine could be easily detected by this method.\r"

Although the vast majority of acute ethanol toxicity deaths follow the ingestion of conventional alcoholic beverages, ethanol can be obtained from a variety of commercial products, which often contain high levels of ethyl alcohol but are not manufactured or designed for consumption. Such products may be easily purchased in locales where statutory limitations restrict liquor availability on Sundays or during the early morning hours. Several acute ethanol fatalities have been encountered in New Mexico that were directly related to consumption of non-beverage ethanol-containing products, all of them occurring during times when alcoholic beverage sales were restricted. Despite the fact that manufacturers deliberately include compounds in these products that discourage ingestion, this policy apparently does little to deter individuals who are searching for a source of ethanol when no conventional beverages are available. The products that were consumed in these fatalities also contained other compounds which would be toxic at much greater concentrations, but which were inconsequential in their effects in comparison with the direct toxic effect of ethanol. Investigation of the scene and awareness that alcohol-containing products can be fatally abused are essential to detecting these unconventional ethanol sources.\r"

Half of all patients died from infection--72 from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) alone. These findings indicate that persons hospitalized with a history of intravenous drug abuse usually die from causes other than overdose and that AIDS and chronic alcoholism are significant problems. Emphasis should be placed upon detecting \"hidden\" intravenous drug deaths to provide more accurate statistical information.\r"

The DNA sequence of the locus was determined and was found to consist of a 16-base consensus sequence and flanking sequences. Oligonucleotide primers complementary to the flanking sequences were synthesized to serve as primers for amplification of MCT118 by the PCR method. Human genomic DNA isolated from blood (2 ng from each sample) was successfully amplified at the MCT118 locus, and polymorphic bands were detectable by ethidium bromide staining after electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. Determination of genotypes at this VNTR locus can now be routinely achieved within 24 h, without the need for Southern blots or radioactive materials. Furthermore, the small size (387 to 723 base pairs) of the DNA fragments produced in the PCR amplification permits good resolution of individual alleles that differ by only one repeat unit. The precise specification of the number of tandem repeats present in each allelic fragment is reproducible from one analysis to another.\r"

However, postmortem total body radiographs revealed healing, symmetrical clavicular fractures and a healing left medial humeral epicondyle fracture. The parents had no explanation for these injuries and denied causing any harm to the child. The location and nature of the fractures strongly suggested abusive origin, and the case was reported to the police and the district attorney's office as child abuse. During the investigation, information from the parents indicated that the child had undergone \"chiropractic\" manipulations by an unlicensed therapist, between three and four weeks prior to death, to correct supposed \"shoulder dislocations.\" This time interval correlated with the histologic age of the injuries, and the history explained their unusual bilateral location and appearance. The parents were exonerated of abuse charges, and the death was ascribed to SIDS.\r"

In the second case, in which both the alleged father and the first wife were deceased, the paternal genotype was determined by using genetic markers from the second wife and four children, which then were compared with the paternal alleles of the child in question, the plaintiff in this case. The high probability of paternity (0.999,998,7) made us conclude that the man probably was the actual father. The DNA analysis by VNTR probes appears to be quite valuable in the study of paternity cases.\r"

Following such recognition, the injury or photographs of the traumatized site are then referred to a forensic odontologist for his or her examination, further characterization, and subsequent comparison with any suspect's dentition. However, if the pathologist misidentifies an injury caused by another mechanism as a human bite, this mistake can potentially be perpetuated by the dental consultant, since relatively few dentists regularly examine traumatic injuries other than those arising from bites. To illustrate such an event, a case is presented involving an incised wound of the breast, which was originally identified as an avulsive bite wound. Detailed examination by two odontologic consultants confirmed the wound as having been caused by human teeth, and further, they related the \"bite injury\" to a specific individual. The bite injury interpretation represented the only scientific evidence implicating the suspect at a subsequent trial for capital murder. Later examination of the tissues and photographs by a forensic pathologist and another dental consultant revealed that the injury was not due to human dentition, but rather resulted from a sharp-edged instrument. These consultants conducted a unique experiment to reduplicate the injury and prove its causation. This information was presented to the jury during the suspect's trial and resulted in his acquittal on all charges.\r"

Although the analysis of specific gunshot wound defects is well covered in the literature, there are few examples of the application of gunshot wound principles to complex wound cases. Three entrances and three exits were identified. A seventh defect resulted from bullet passage. Finally, the wounds were sequenced.\r"

Six biannual questionnaires were self-administered between 1984 and 1988. General mental health was determined by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL). An abbreviated version of the Center for Epidemiologic Study Depression Scale (CESD-5) and an adapted Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) question also measured depression. Suicidal ideation was assessed by one question in the HSCL. AIDS-specific distress was determined by three subscales specifically developed for this study. While mean HSCL and CESD-5 scores were stable during the observational period, AIDS-specific distress increased over time. The HSCL scores for the cohort were somewhat elevated above general population norms but considerably below psychiatric outpatient norms. Fewer than 12% of the men reported elevated HSCL or CESD-5 scores three or more times. A self-reported episode of depression of two weeks or more, measured by the DIS screening question, was experienced by 40.1% of the sample. Suicidal ideation was reported on three or more visits by 18.8% of the men. The younger members of this cohort exhibit greater general and AIDS-specific distress. Income was inversely associated with general distress. HIV-seropositive participants had generally higher AIDS-specific distress scores than those who were seronegative, but their scores were equivalent on the HSCL and CESD-5.\r"

Forty-five schizophrenic inpatients were classified accordingly into groups of 15 each and compared with one another and with 15 normal control subjects on a visual backward masking task. Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed that all three schizophrenic groups were less efficient information processors than were normal subjects. Relative to the positive group, the negative group displayed significantly longer registration thresholds, fewer correct target stimulus detections, and longer time intervals to achieve their first significant improvement in performance and to first exceed chance response levels. The three syndrome groups were not significantly different in their rates of improvement over trials. Secondary correlational analyses showed that the information-processing measures were unrelated to a variety of demographic, psychiatric, and cognitive developmental variables, although shorter recognition thresholds and shorter unmasking interval scores were associated with faster psychomotor rates. Complex interrelationships were uncovered between the information-processing measures, positive and negative symptomatology, and general psychopathology. The results were interpreted as supporting the validity of the positive-negative distinction for explaining some of the heterogeneity in schizophrenia.\r"

Systematic descriptions of these diagnoses were developed based on features identified from the literature that were organized using the clinicians' ratings. Each diagnosis was described in terms of a series of behavioral dimensions. Sets of behavioral exemplars were developed to assess each dimension. Dimensions and diagnoses were found to exhibit satisfactory levels of internal consistency that were cross-validated in a general population sample of 274 subjects and a clinical sample of 133 patients with a diagnosis of personality disorder. Some dimensions did not correlate highly with the total diagnosis score. Diagnoses could probably be refined by eliminating these dimensions. The structural relationships between dimensions delineating each diagnosis were explored using factor analysis. Diagnoses were not unifactorial. Instead, each diagnosis was found to be composed of two factors. The factorial structure of each diagnosis was found to be similar in the general population and clinical sample. It is suggested that the results support a dimensional representation of these diagnoses using three dimensions: paranoid behaviors, social avoidance, and perceptual cognitive distortion.\r"

We discuss issues of methodology and report a study of compliance, test-retest reliability, and validity with a new self-monitoring instrument, the Parkinson's Symptom Diary. Two recordings of frequency (loss of balance, hesitation-freezing) and two ratings of severity (tremor, difficulty walking) were made four times daily for one week by patients (N = 73) who were without apparent loss of cognitive or memory functions. A total of 91% of the diaries received (97% of requested) met strict compliance criteria so that independent sampling over days could be assumed. Test-retest stability over one month was demonstrated for each score (all Spearman rho greater than .85) in a representative subsample of 28 patients. Criterion validity was demonstrated for each score by an expected pattern of correlations with independently obtained observer ratings of the same or related indices of disease, and by comparison with Hoehn and Yahr disability stages. By its simplicity, this self-assessment device can be an invaluable complement to traditional methods of clinical and laboratory assessment in the care and evaluation of Parkinson patients.\r"

The two groups did not differ in severity of illness or positive and negative syndromes. There were also no differences in control variables such as age, gender, education, intelligence, premorbid adjustment, neuroleptic dose, onset and chronicity of illness, continuity of hospitalization, paranoid subtype, and psychiatric illness in the family. Cocaine history was associated with multiple illicit drug use, but for other substances there was no increased liability for depression or cognitive deficits.

This paper describes a model of the empathic process that enables clinicians, teachers, and researchers to examine specific components of the model and to determine the influence of particular mediators on the empathic process. Empathy is conceptualized as a three-phase time-sequenced process rather than as a multidimensional or multicomponent phenomenon. Stripped of detail, the empathic process reveals an inducement phase, a matching phase, and a participatory-helping phase. By examining these phases, it becomes possible to distinguish empathy from closely related concepts such as sympathy. Each of the phases reveals numerous mediating variables that influence the outcome of the phase, i.e., whether the process of empathy continues or an alternate terminal point is reached. Many of these mediators are derived from existing conceptual and empirical work on empathy. Particular attention is paid to situational or contextual mediators of empathy. Contextual mediators have only recently been acknowledged as an important variable in the empathic process. For clinicians, identification of contextual variables that may be responsive to intervention is a critical step in the modification of the clinical environment. We would suggest that clinical empathy research is largely the study of these mediating influences and should be recognized as such.\r"

Over the course of the 104 years since Gilles de la Tourette described the syndrome that bears his name, a body of carefully collected, described, and analyzed data has produced a model of the genetics that implicates a single dominant gene that is variably penetrant in males and females. Moreover, the locus of action of this gene is most likely in the dopaminergic system of the midbrain. A systematic search for this gene using recombinant DNA techniques is under way.\r"

  ".W": "In a controlled study, the authors determined the risk of developing major mental illness after catastrophic financial loss. Seventy-two adults who lost their retirement savings in a bank fraud were interviewed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Major depression by DSM-III criteria was present in 29% of the victims during the first 20 months after their loss as compared with 2% of 66 age, gender, and residential area-matched control subjects (p less than .0001). Generalized anxiety disorder as defined by DSM-III criteria was experienced by 27% of victims after the loss as compared with 10% of control subjects (p = .03). After the loss, victims had lower subjective health ratings, more functional somatic complaints, and higher tranquilizer usage than control subjects. There was no difference between depressed and nondepressed in types of coping responses or use of social supports and confidants. Only four of 21 victims who suffered major depression sought help from a mental health professional. We conclude that catastrophic financial loss may result in the onset of major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.\r"

The distribution of scores for all 11 PD dimensions was skewed to the right. A principal components analysis with varimax rotation produced three factors that closely corresponded to DSM-III's suggested clustering of the PDs into eccentric, dramatic, and anxious types. Men scored significantly higher on the paranoid, schizoid, compulsive, antisocial, and narcissistic dimensions, whereas women had significantly higher histrionic, dependent, and avoidant scores. Age was negatively correlated with most of the PD dimensions, and the correlations were strongest with the four PDs in cluster 2 (histrionic, antisocial, narcissistic, and borderline). Each of the eight axis I disorders examined was associated with increased axis II pathology.\r"

The anxiety disorders were further differentiated in panic and nonpanic anxiety disorders. The groups were compared as to differences in frequency of personality disorders assessed by means of the Structured Interview for DSM-III Personality Disorders. The mixed major depression/anxiety disorder group appeared to be the most deviant with more severe personality disorders such as paranoid and borderline in addition to avoidant and dependent personality disorder. The differentiation between panic and nonpanic anxiety showed that it was patients with nonpanic anxiety features in addition to major depression who had this higher frequency of personality disorders. These findings imply that it is important to distinguish between major depression cases with and without anxiety disorders both in forthcoming research and in clinical practice.\r"

As part of a larger epidemiological research, the data for this paper derive from diagnostic interviews of 622 Korean immigrants (20 years and older) residing in the Chicago area. Data analyses reveal that, among the respondents in general, those who are married, highly educated, and currently employed in a high-status occupation indicate better subjective mental health (less demoralized and more satisfied with life) than others. Of other variables examined, however, significant gender differences in the correlates of mental health are observed. For the male immigrants, a set of work-related variables is clearly the strongest correlate of their mental health, whereas no such distinctive set of variables accounts for the female immigrants' mental health. Nevertheless, the family life satisfaction and several ethnic attachment variables are moderately related to the female immigrants' mental health. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed in light of the confluence of ethnic attachment and acculturation on immigrants' mental health.\r"

A 45-item questionnaire was developed with items derived from the Murdock et al. categories, with additional items covering western notions of physiological causation and stress. The questionnaire was administered to 261 people, mostly college students. Multi-dimensional scaling analysis shows four clusters of mental distress: a) stress; b) western physiological; c) nonwestern physiological; and d) supernatural. These clusters form two dimensions: western physiological vs. supernatural and impersonal vs. personalistic explanations. Natural and stress items are separated from supernatural and nonwestern physiological items along the first dimension. Brain damage, physical illness, and genetic defects have the greatest separation along the first dimension. Being hot, the body being out of balance, and wind currents passing through the body most strongly represent the non-western physiological category. The questionnaire has the potential to be used for community health screening and for monitoring patient care, as well as with students in the health sciences and with health practitioners.\r"

The astrocyte was the cell of primary interest and the cell tested in the following experiments. The effect of ECCM on astrocytes was concentration and time dependent. The growth factor was released by EC into the medium in a cumulative manner for up to 72 hours. This release was not the result of a nonspecific leakage of an internal store, since the DNA synthetic activity of cell lysates was negligible. The growth factor secretion per cell was higher in sparse than in confluent EC cultures and was partially inhibited by preincubation of EC with interleukin-1. The DNA synthetic activity was due to a peptide, different from basic fibroblast growth factor, transferrin, bovine fibronectin and platelet derived growth factor, with a molecular weight greater than 50,000. The peptide derived from the cerebral capillary EC could be involved in the local signaling between cell types that control new vessel formation in development, in regeneration after brain tissue injury, or in tumor formation.\r"

  ".W": "After peripheral nerve fiber degeneration, Schwann cell basement membranes (SCBM) persist, maintain the columnar orientation of multiplying Schwann cells, and provide pathways for regenerating axons to original target tissue. Despite the putative importance of these functions, there is little quantitative information on SCBM in chronic denervation. The number, integrity, shape, and size of SCBM were evaluated in transverse electron micrographs of peroneal nerves of groups of mice at various times after permanent sciatic nerve transection. With increasing time after transection, the SCBM fragment, the fragments become shorter, dispersed throughout the endoneurium and partially disappear. The discontinuity, dispersion, and partial disappearance of SCBM, which worsens with time after nerve transection, alters the scaffold by which neurites grow back to formerly innervated or appropriate target tissue. Without reaching appropriate target tissue, regenerating fibers may fail to develop or undergo retrograde atrophy and degeneration. The progressive changes of the SCBM may contribute to the demonstrated poor regeneration when nerve reconnection is delayed, or when proximal nerves are reconnected, so that much time may elapse before neurites grow back to distal nerve.\r"

Dialysis and renal transplantation now frequently enable patients with cystinosis to live into adulthood. Examinations at autopsy of a 28-year-old man who died of complications of this disease showed deposits of cystine crystals in multiple organs. There was severe cerebral involvement with multifocal cystic necrosis, dystrophic calcification, spongy change, and vacuolization that had produced profound neurologic deficits. Electron microscopy of the brain documented cytoplasmic deposition of cystine crystals in membrane bound vacuoles within the cytoplasm of pericytes and within parenchymal cells of the white matter. While affected patients who have received renal transplants may no longer die from renal failure, serious, potentially life-threatening, neurologic complications of this disorder may supervene.\r"

The peak twitch tension (Fmax) and rates of force development and relaxation were significantly lower in old (24 months old) rats than in young (six month old) rats. In teased muscle fiber preparations, there was a 5% reduction in the mean number of fibers in the aging plantaris muscle. Histologically, a net loss of fibers occurred only in the muscle belly. Histochemically, fewer Type I fibers were seen in the belly and proximal regions, whereas distally fewer Type IIa fibers were seen. The loss of Types I and IIa oxidative fibers suggested a conservation of fast-twitch Type IIb fibers in a fast-twitch muscle. The relatively small loss of muscle fibers does not explain the large decline in muscle contractile performance which, despite established doctrine, was independent of muscle mass, fiber number or size, or number of fast-twitch fibers. The reduced force production in aging rat muscle appears to be due to a defect in excitation, contraction performance or metabolic activity, rather than a purely anatomical abnormality of muscle.\r"

  ".W": "A distinct triad of central nervous system (CNS) malformations (prosencephalic dysgenesis, occipital exencephalocele and rhombic roof dysgenesis) was present in seven cases of the Meckel-Gruber syndrome examined at autopsy. We compared our findings with those previously described. Microcephaly, sloping forehead, posterior occipital exencephalocele, cerebellar hypoplasia, Chiari malformation, hydrocephalus, polymicrogyria, arhinencephaly, holoprosencephaly and anencephaly constituted a broad spectrum of the reported CNS anomalies. Few reports contained a comprehensive description of the observed CNS malformations. In those reports, and in our cases, features of prosencephalic dysgenesis included agenesis of olfactory bulbs and tracts (arhinencephaly), hypoplasia of optic nerves and chiasm, agenesis of corpus callosum, fused thalami or complete holoprosencephaly. The occipital encephalocele has consisted of a displacement of rhombic roof elements, including caudal third ventricle, cerebellar vermis and fourth ventricle, extruded through an enlarged posterior fontanelle rather than through an occipital cranium bifidum and is thus more precisely labeled an exencephalocele. Different degrees of dysgenesis of posterior fossa structures, described by some as a variant of Dandy-Walker cyst with features of a Chiari malformation, were often associated with this occipital exencephalocele. This pattern of CNS anomalies represents a triad of malformations probably associated with defective ventral induction of the developing CNS by the prechordal mesoderm.\r"

Treatment of such adverse reactions with dexamethasone is highly effective. However, it has been shown that dexamethasone lowers the plasma levels of praziquantel, thus reducing its cysticidal efficacy. We measured plasma levels of albendazole, another strong cysticidal drug, when dexamethasone was given simultaneously. We found that dexamethasone increased the plasma levels of albendazole by about 50% (P less than 0.002); hence, it seems that cysticercosis and the ensuing inflammation can be treated simultaneously with albendazole and dexamethasone without diminishing the efficacy of the cysticidal drug.\r"

Because of these findings, the cholinergic function in HD was studied by measuring cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) choline levels and AChE activity during a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled clinical trial of isoniazid. While mean choline levels adjusted for age were lower compared with controls (P = 0.0007), AChE activity did not differ between HD patients and normal controls. Treatment with isoniazid had no significant effect on CSF choline levels or CSF AChE activity. CSF AChE activity showed a statistically significant increase with advancing age. The reduced level of choline in CSF of HD patients may reflect either a defect in choline transport into the brain or a decrease of choline-phospholipid output from the brain.\r"

All patients showed episodic EEG activities synchronous with myoclonic jerks only in REM sleep. These episodes were noted 5-15 times throughout the night, and each episode lasting for 1-7 s. They were negative or positive waves of saw-tooth appearance which were distributed predominantly in the central region. During the episodes, the frequency of myoclonic jerks increased in two patients.

  ".W": "Whether multiple sclerosis (MS) can cause headaches is controversial. To clarify the association between headaches and MS we prospectively analyzed 104 consecutive MS patients using detailed headache evaluations. Fifty-four patients (52%) reported headaches, compared with 5 of 35 (14%) patients initially suspected to have MS but subsequently proven to have other disorders, and 18 of 100 (18%) matched general neurology patients. The MS patients had tension headaches or vascular headaches of the migraine type; there was no distinctive \"MS headache.\" Seven of these patients had headaches with their first MS symptoms, but in only one did headaches recur with disease activity. Headaches did not correlate with any clinical features of MS. We conclude that an association between headaches and MS may exist.\r"

  ".W": "Six (1%) of 578 patients admitted for cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack (TIA) suffered a fatal or severely disabling in-hospital cerebral infarction following a period of stabilization or improvement lasting more than 1 day. These infarctions were characterized by the sudden onset of stupor or coma and subsequent development of transtentorial herniation due to carotid or middle cerebral artery territory infarction, or widespread brain-stem infarction due to basilar occlusion. Only one patient survived. Four patients had large-vessel disease documented by Doppler, angiography, or at autopsy. Each of these six infarcts occurred during the morning hours, 4-9 days after the initial event, 3-8 days after initiation of intravenous heparin, and within 4-8 h after intravenous heparin had been discontinued. No coagulation abnormalities were documented. We believe that these cases indicate that among patients admitted for cerebral infarction or TIA, fatal or severely disabling in-hospital cerebral infarction after a period of stabilization or improvement may occur in patients having an initially mild to moderate clinical deficit, that those suffering large artery disease may be at greater risk, and that there may be a relationship between heparin withdrawal and cerebral infarction in some patients.\r"

On the contralateral side, the last three components were also present. The second component was different from the normal R2 response in that its latency was shorter than normal and it did not habituate by stimulation at a rate of 10 Hz. In addition, it was more affected by diazepam than the third or fourth components. It is considered that R2 may have consisted of three components and that a shorter latency of the second component could be explained by facilitation.\r"

Cardiac histopathology consisted of myocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and nuclear hyperchromaticity without mitochondrial abnormalities. Myopathy and heart disease were not clinically evident in her family, although three relatives had unexplained shortened Achilles tendons without weakness. Tendon contractures may be a partial expression of this myopathic disorder, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. A muscular dystrophy clinically similar to that of the Emery-Dreifuss (EDMD) type can thus occur in women. Rather than the cardiac arrhythmias typical of EDMD, a dilated cardiomyopathy may occur and present with severe congestive heart failure. This is the first report of cardiac transplantation in such a case.\r"

Mean arterial pressure was compared with cuff pressure for the maximum acoustic index. Ten mongrel dogs were fitted with appropriately sized blood-pressure cuffs containing a microphone mounted inside the bladder and positioned over the brachial artery. The Korotkoff sounds, cuff pressure, and direct arterial pressure were recorded over a range of mean arterial pressures (23 to 155 mm Hg), achieved by manipulating the depth of anesthesia with halothane. It was found that cuff pressure at the maximum acoustic index overestimated mean arterial blood pressure by a mean of 14% (range, -8 to +30%).\r"

To test whether routine placement according to acoustic criteria results in placement of the core temperature sensor in the region of contiguity between the esophagus and the heart, we determined the depth of placement electrocardiographically. All patients were undergoing nonthoracic elective operations requiring general anesthesia and tracheal intubation. First, we established that different observers selected the same esophageal depth within +/- 1 cm electrocardiographically, using the criterion of a symmetric biphasic P wave of maximal amplitude (7 patients). Then, in 30 more patients, we compared routine acoustic placements with the depths of the maximal-amplitude biphasic P wave. Stethoscopes placed according to acoustic criteria were within +/- 3 cm of P-wave depths in 15 of 30 patients. In the remaining patients, measured discrepancies ranged up to 13.5 cm. We conclude that the prevailing stethoscope design, with a thermistor at the tip, below the acoustic window, does not ensure placement of the thermistor within the optimal region for monitoring of core temperature. A modification in design that would take advantage of the reliability of electrocardiographic positioning is suggested.\r"

Deficiencies in observer vigilance may limit the effectiveness of this monitoring instrument. The aim of this study was to determine how long it took for an observer to detect a surreptitiously occluded monaural esophageal stethoscope in the setting of clinical anesthesia. During routine anesthesia, where an esophageal stethoscope was in use, a computer-guided device would artificially, silently, and at random time intervals, occlude the stethoscope tubing. Personnel using the stethoscope noted when they perceived the absence of stethoscope sounds. We studied 320 stethoscope occlusions in 32 patients. The time between stethoscope occlusion and detection was 34 +/- 59 seconds (mean +/- SD). Eighty-seven percent of detections were made in less than 60 seconds. However, 13% of detections were delayed for more than 60 seconds, and 2.3% for more than 240 seconds. While anesthesia personnel using an esophageal stethoscope could detect most stethoscope occlusions, failure to appreciate such episodes occurred in a small but significant number of cases. This suggests that the esophageal stethoscope has some definite limitations as a continuous monitor and that other monitoring techniques, such as oximetry, capnography, and ventilator disconnect alarms, as well as visual/tactile inspection of the patient, should be used as well.\r"

The piezoelectric belts are shown to measure flow linearly when compared with a screen pneumotachometer to a flow of at least 2.6 L/s. There is no phase shift between the peak flow of belts and the pneumotachometer up to a frequency of at least 9.2 Hz.

  ".U": "91038154\r", 
  ".W": "In 38 adults undergoing cardiac surgery, 4 indirect blood pressure techniques were compared with brachial arterial blood pressure at predetermined intervals before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Indirect blood pressure measurement techniques included automated oscillometry, manual auscultation, visual onset of oscillation (flicker) and return-to-flow methods. Hemodynamic measurements or calculations included heart rate, cardiac index, stroke volume index, and systemic vascular resistance index. Indirect and intraarterial blood pressure values were compared by simple linear regression by patient and measurement period. Measurement errors (arterial minus indirect blood pressure) were calculated, and stepwise regression assessed the relationship between measurement error and heart rate, cardiac index, stroke volume index, and systemic vascular resistance index. Indirect to intraarterial blood pressure correlation coefficients varied over time, with the strongest correlations often occurring at the first and last measurement periods (preinduction and 60 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass), particularly for systolic blood pressure. Within-patient correlations between indirect and arterial blood pressure varied widely--they were consistently high or low in some patients. In other patients, correlations were especially weak with a particular indirect blood pressure method for systolic, mean, or diastolic blood pressure; in some cases indirect blood pressure was inadequate for clinical diagnosis of acute blood pressure changes or trends. The mean correlations between indirect and direct blood pressure values were, for systolic blood pressure: 0.69 for oscillometry, 0.77 for auscultation, 0.73 for flicker, and 0.74 for return-to-flow; for mean blood pressure: 0.70 for oscillometry and 0.73 for auscultation; and for diastolic blood pressure: 0.73 for oscillometry and 0.69 for auscultation. The mean measurement errors (arterial minus indirect values) for the individual indirect blood pressure methods were, for systolic: 0 mm Hg for oscillometry, 9 mm Hg for auscultation, -5 mm Hg for flicker, 7 mm Hg for return-to-flow; for mean: -6 mm Hg for oscillometry, and -3 mm Hg for auscultation; and for diastolic: -9 mm Hg for oscillometry and -8 mm Hg for auscultation. Mean measurement error for systolic blood pressure was thus least with automated oscillometry and greatest with manual auscultation, while standard deviations ranging from 9 to 15 mm Hg confirmed the highly variable nature of single indirect blood pressure measurements. Except for oscillometric diastolic blood pressure, a combination of systemic hemodynamics (heart rate, stroke volume index, systemic vascular resistance index, and cardiac index) correlated with each indirect blood pressure measurement error, which suggests that particular numeric ranges of these variables minimize measurement error.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Initially, a prototype system was tested (10 subjects); several years later the resulting commercial system was tested in a quiet environment (11 subjects) and in noisy operating rooms (10 subjects). For each test an anesthetist first trained the system to recognize his or her voice by reading aloud a list of common anesthetic terms. To determine recognition accuracy, the percentage of words recognized correctly by the computer, each subject repeated the vocabulary words ten times. Although accuracy was similar during the three tests, it was slightly higher with the laboratory test (mean percent of words recognized correctly, 96.5%; range of accuracy for individual anesthetists, 91.6 to 98.8%) than with the prototype test (95.9%; range, 89.1 to 99.6%). Accuracy was lowest with the operating room test (95.3%; range, 87.8 to 98.4%). Twenty-four words caused particular difficulty during the laboratory test and were eliminated from the vocabulary of the subsequent operating room test. Omitting these 24 words from the laboratory vocabulary list allowed a more nearly direct comparison with the results from the operating room list; recognition accuracy improved in the former to 97.5% (range, 92.1 to 98.9%). Two anesthetists--one each from the laboratory and operating room tests--performed poorly, and eliminating their scores changed the respective overall scores to 98.2% (range, 96.7 to 98.9%) and 96.5% (range, 94.3 to 98.4%). Thus, the corrected difference between the laboratory accuracy and the operating room accuracy was 1.7%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The analysis of records collected during long-term ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring has traditionally involved the review of massive data, either manually or with the aid of interactive scanning computers. Many factors complicate this analysis, including the use of analog tape for storage of electrocardiographic waveforms, the need to analyze 100,000 waveforms from an average 24-hour study, and the need to deal with an interface that compresses 24 hours of data into as little as 6 minutes on a screen. Today, the computer incorporated in the monitor can scrutinize each cardiac cycle in real time. The system produces a statistical report based on every heart beat and also performs data reduction and storage of electrocardiograph samples. To assess real-time analysis we examined data collected from the Circadian CircaMed ambulatory electrocardiography system. We found that it could detect and quantify simple or complex ventricular ectopic beats, brady- or tachyarrhythmic events, and ST-segment deviation. One hundred fifty patients 21 to 85 years old with symptoms or clinical finding suggestive of ischemia, cardiac arrhythmia, or conductive defects were referred to our electrocardiography laboratory for ambulatory monitoring. The results demonstrate that this system can detect the full range of cardiac disease found with the traditional method. Of the 150 patients, ambulatory electrocardiographic tests were positive in 93 (62%). In addition, we developed a methodology for lead placement when using two bipolar leads, as is typical for ambulatory electrocardiography. We present a procedure for determining the optimum lead placement that is based on the patient's history and a 12-lead electrocardiogram.\r"

When the signal was sampled at 200 Hz with an analog-to-digital converter, an artifact was observed. The 3.5-Hz artifact had an amplitude of 0.3 to 0.9 mm Hg and was caused by aliasing of a noise contaminant from the 2,403.5-Hz electrical excitation signal of the transducer. The artifact was completely eliminated with a 100-Hz low-pass filter. Electrical filtering is necessary for accurate acquisition of pressure measurements with analog-to-digital conversion, even when the sampling rate satisfies the Nyquist criterion for the frequency response of the mechanical system. Although the impact of the artifact is small in the clinical area, it is important under some research circumstances.\r"

Logical explanations are provided for the economic, technical, and physiologic benefits of a stochastic system identification technique for measuring cardiac output. Heat is supplied by a catheter-mounted filament driven according to a pseudorandom binary sequence. Volumetric fluid flow is derived by a cross-correlation algorithm written in the C language. In vitro validation is performed with water in a flow bench. The computed flow (y) compared with the in-line-measured flow (x) yields the linear regression y = 1.024x - 0.157 (r = 0.99). The average coefficient of variation is less than 2% over a volumetric fluid flow range of 2 to 10 L/min.\r"

Second, all the necessary tools for transferring this information into a computer and hence onto a piece of paper are already available. Third, the need for an improvement over the current way of keeping records is widely recognized. Manual records are often inaccurate, biased, incomplete, and illegible, and they divert attention from more important tasks of the anesthetist. Although automated record keeping will not produce perfection, it will improve the situation enough to justify the effort.\r"

The logic goes as follows: (1) It is good to have accurate records because accurate records (a) make clinical decision making more effective and improve patient safety, (b) provide better defense against frivolous lawsuits, and (c) enable more astute medical policy decisions based on improved retrospective case reviews; (2) automatic record-keeping systems will give more nearly accurate records; (3) therefore, quality of care will improve if we acquire automatic record-keeping systems. This logic fails on several counts, which are detailed in this essay. Having said all this, however, I do believe that automated record systems will be implemented and they will be extremely useful, both for the patient and for those who care for the patient. However, we must exercise great care in their design and implementation, lest they wind up doing more harm than good.\r"

  ".W": "Testicular cancer has become a model for a curable neoplasm. Prior to the advent of cisplatin combination chemotherapy, standard chemotherapy consisted of dactinomycin, alone or in combination with chlorambucil and methotrexate. Disseminated germ cell tumors were chemosensitive to these older regimens, with a 50% objective response rate and a 10% to 20% complete remission rate; however, the cure rate was only 5% to 10%. In 1974, we began our initial cisplatin plus vinblastine plus bleomycin (PVB) chemotherapy. Thirty-three of 47 patients with disseminated germ cell tumors treated from 1974 to 1976 achieved a complete remission (CR), and an additional five (11%) were rendered disease-free with post-PVB resection of teratoma or carcinoma. Twenty-seven (57%) of these patients are continuously disease-free with a minimal follow-up of 13 + years. Thus, cisplatin-based chemotherapy produced a one-log increase in the cure rate compared with dactinomycin. A subsequent phase III study performed from 1976 to 1978 demonstrated that the vinblastine dosage could be reduced 25% from 0.4 mg/kg to 0.3 mg/kg with a reduction in toxicity but without any decrement in therapeutic efficacy. A third-generation PVB study from 1978 to 1981 documented that optimal cure rates were achieved with 12 weeks of induction therapy with PVB and that long-term maintenance therapy with vinblastine was unnecessary. In 1978, we initiated salvage therapy with cisplatin plus etoposide (VP-16) in patients not cured with PVB, and 25% of these patients were subsequently cured with this regimen. This represented the first time an adult solid tumor had been cured with a second-line regimen. In 1983, we began studies with third-line therapy with cisplatin plus ifosfamide combination chemotherapy, and even in this refractory setting, approximately 20% of patients are curable. From 1981 to 1984, we compared cisplatin plus VP-16 plus bleomycin (PVP16B) with PVB as first-line chemotherapy. There was a significant reduction in neuromuscular toxicity favoring the VP-16 arm, and furthermore, 78% of these patients were continuously disease-free compared with 66% with PVB. Approximately 75% of patients with disseminated germ cell tumors will be cured with PVP16B, and an additional 10% are curable with salvage chemotherapy. This represents the highest cure rate in any adult malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "The prognostic effect of c-myc oncogene overexpression was assessed in a multivariate analysis of 93 patients with invasive carcinoma of the cervix, stage Ib, IIa, and IIb proximal. The treatment was based on the association of brachytherapy-colpohysterectomy and lymphadenectomy. Analysis of c-myc gene expression was done using Northern and slot blot hybridization techniques. Overexpression of c-myc (ie, levels at least three times the mean observed in normal tissues) was present in 33% of the tumors. The proportion of carcinomas with c-myc overexpression significantly increased with the size of the primary tumor (P = .04). No relationship was found between c-myc overexpression and the other clinical and histologic parameters, including the nodal status. The relative risk of relapse (overall, pelvic failure, distant metastases) was analyzed in a Cox's proportional hazards model. Three factors were significantly related to the risk of overall relapse when the multivariate analysis was performed, namely, the tumor size, the nodal status, and c-myc expression. A combination of c-myc expression and the nodal status provided a very accurate indication of the risk of relapse. Indeed, patients with negative nodes had a 3-year disease-free survival rate of 93% (95% confidence interval [Cl], 79% to 98%) when c-myc was expressed at a normal level, whereas this rate was only 51% (95% Cl, 26% to 63%) when c-myc was overexpressed (log-rank test, P = .02). In addition, in the subgroup of patients with positive nodes, this rate was 44% (95% Cl, 25% to 77%) and 15% (95% Cl, 4% to 49%) when c-myc gene was expressed at normal level, or overexpressed, respectively. Finally, c-myc gene overexpression was, in the multivariate analysis, the first factor selected by the model regarding the risk of distant metastases.\r"

All but two patients had one prior trial of tamoxifen therapy for either metastatic disease (74%) or as adjuvant treatment (26%). Pretreatment characteristics were similar for both arms. High-dose MA resulted in a superior complete plus partial response rate (27% v 10%, P = .005), time to treatment failure (median, 8.0 v 3.2 months, P = .019), and survival (median, 22.4 v 16.5 months, P = .04) when compared with standard-dose therapy. These differences remained significant after adjustment for other covariates. Thirty-four patients were given high-dose MA after failure of standard-dose MA treatment, and none responded. Weight gain was the most distressing side effect, with 13% of standard-dose and 43% of high-dose patients gaining more than 20 lbs. Four major cardiovascular events occurred in patients receiving high-dose treatment and one in patients given standard doses. Other toxicity was modest. High-dose MA may represent a significant improvement in secondary endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer patients refractory to initial endocrine treatment, but its use on a regular basis should be reserved until these results are confirmed by other clinical trials.\r"

  ".W": "The cardiotoxicity of epirubicin (EPI) was evaluated clinically, radiologically, with ECG, and with multiple ECG-gated radionuclide determination of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) during rest in 135 patients with advanced breast cancer. The EPI doses were 60 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks or 45 mg/m2 plus vindesine 3 mg/m2 on the same schedule. The median cumulative dose of EPI was 500 mg/m2 (range, 47 to 1,563). Eight of the 135 patients developed congestive heart failure (CHF). Of 67 patients treated with EPI less than 500 mg/m2, none developed CHF. Among 48 patients treated with doses between 500 and 1,000 mg/m2, one had CHF (2%; 95% confidence limits, 0.1 to 11.1). Among 20 patients who received EPI from 1,000 to 1,563 mg/m2, seven developed CHF (35%; 95% confidence limits, 15.4 to 59.2). Four patients died due to cardiotoxicity. The risk of EPI cardiotoxicity at the present schedule is considerable at doses above 1,000 mg/m2. At doses between 500 and 1,000 mg/m2 the risk of CHF decreases, and at doses below 500 mg/m2, it is negligible. For all patients, the prevalence of CHF was 6% and the sensitivity of LVEF high (95%), mainly due to the low incidence of CHF. Among the 20 patients who received EPI at more than 1,000 mg/m2, the prevalence of CHF was 35% and the sensitivity only 64%. The specificity was maximally 62%. Our results suggest that LVEF is of no value as a predictor for CHF.\r"

The goal of this program was to gain rapid, repetitive exposure to multiple, active drugs. Treatment was administered weekly for a total of 16 weeks. Seventy-six SCLC patients (limited disease, 34; extensive disease, 42) were treated. The overall complete plus partial response rate was 82%. Complete response rates of 47% and 38% were observed in patients with limited (LD) and extensive disease (ED), respectively. The median survivals for patients with LD and ED were 16.6 and 11.4 months, respectively. Toxicities were tolerable and were primarily hematologic. Twenty-six patients had one or more transient life-threatening toxicities, but only one patient developed a fatal toxicity. Eighty-four percent of the patients received 80% or greater of the intended protocol dosages over the entire 16-week treatment period. We conclude that this intensive, short-duration treatment regimen is at least as good as other \"standard\" regimens, and we are encouraged aged by the complete response rate and median survival in patients with ED SCLC.\r"

  ".W": "Adoptive immunotherapy with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells has been effective in treating some advanced malignancies in animals and humans. One complication of this treatment is a reversible, oliguric, acute renal failure, which has been ascribed to renal hypoperfusion and resultant prerenal azotemia. We serially studied renal function in 10 patients receiving high-dose regimens of recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) to attempt to delineate further the nature of the renal dysfunction caused by IL-2 treatment. Renal plasma flow was computed from iodine 131 (I-131 Hippuran; Mediphysics, Paramus, NJ) orthoiodohippurate, excretion curves, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined by creatinine clearance. Studies done prior to and on day 4 of treatment showed that GFR fell in nine of 10 patients, with a mean decrease of 43% +/- 8%, and renal plasma flow fell in five of the 10 patients with a mean decrease of 5% +/- 10%. The average pretherapy filtration fraction was calculated to be 23% +/- 1% and after 4 days of treatment, decreased to a mean value of 15 +/- 2%. The BUN to creatinine ratio also declined in all patients. These findings collectively suggest that IL-2 nephrotoxicity may result from an intrarenal defect in addition to the previously described prerenal azotemia. Additionally, radionuclide studies of renal function are a reliable and reproducible noninvasive method of assessing these changes in renal function.\r"

Twelve pubescent or postpubescent girls were studied for long-term sequelae. Eleven of 12 patients have had a normal puberty, two have a total of three healthy children, 11 have normal menses, and 10 normal menarche (one after hormonal replacement). Only one patient underwent hysterectomy following low-dose brachytherapy. Five girls have no vaginal complications, and three are sexually active. Three have had minimal vaginal sequelae, which required surgical correction to permit sexual intercourse. Four girls sustained serious sequelae (colorectal, vaginal, urethral, and ureteral stenosis). These sequelae, secondary to irradiation, are potentially avoidable in the future given the current advances in brachytherapy and improvements in dosimetry. This conservative treatment is useful and appropriate for girls with RMS of vulvar or vaginal origin when complete remission cannot be obtained with chemotherapy and partial colpectomy.\r"

Thirteen of 15 responded to preradiation chemotherapy. Four of 13 relapsed. Relapse occurred at the level of the primary tumor in three of four. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 59%, similar to that achieved in a previous series treated with a comparable therapeutic approach that also included whole-brain radiotherapy as a prophylaxis of possible occult meningeal seeding. It is concluded that CNS prophylaxis with radiotherapy is questionable in the management of childhood RMSA with meningeal extension.\r"

  ".W": "We treated 64 patients with metastatic melanoma using a melanoma vaccine preceded by low-dose cyclophosphamide (CY), and monitored immunologic effects and antitumor activity. On day 0, the patients were given CY 300 mg/m2 intravenously. Three days later, they were injected intradermally with vaccine consisting of 10 to 25 x 10(6) autologous, enzymatically dissociated, cryopreserved, irradiated (25 Gy) tumor cells mixed with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). This treatment sequence was repeated every 28 days. Of 40 assessable patients with measurable metastases, five had responses, four complete and one partial, with a median duration of 10 months (7 to 84+ months). In six additional patients, we observed an antitumor response that seems to be peculiar to this vaccine therapy: the regression of metastatic lesions that appeared after the immunotherapy was begun. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to autologous, mechanically dissociated melanoma cells that had not been exposed to extraneous antigens, such as enzymes or fetal calf serum, increased significantly following immunotherapy (day 0 v day 49, P less than .001; day 0 v day 161, P less than .001; day 0 v day 217, P = .021). Antitumor responses to the vaccine were strongly associated with DTH, as indicated by three observations: (1) eight of 10 patients who exhibited tumor regression had positive DTH, (2) in postsurgical adjuvant patients, there was a highly significant linear relationship (P less than .001) between the intensity of DTH to autologous melanoma cells and the time to recurrence of tumor, and (3) nine patients who developed DTH to the autologous melanoma cells in their original vaccine developed new metastases that failed to elicit DTH or elicited a much smaller response. In three cases, we were able to excise regressing tumors for histologic examination; such tumors were characterized by an intense infiltration of lymphocytes. This demonstration that an immune response to melanoma-associated antigens can be elicited in cancer-bearing patients provides some basis for optimism about the prospects for developing active immunotherapy that has practical therapeutic value.\r"

These NMRS measurements detected a long-lived tumor pool of 5FU in six of 11 tumors in our patients including carcinomas in the pelvis, breast, lung, and liver. The half-life (T1/2) of this tumor pool of \"trapped\" 5FU was 0.33 to 1.3 hours (20 to 78 minutes), much longer than the T1/2 of 5FU in blood (5 to 15 minutes). Neither the anabolites of 5FU (fluorinated nucleosides, nucleotides, 5FU-RNA, or 5FU-thymidylate synthase) nor the catabolites (eg, fluorobetaalanine [FBAL]) were detectable by 19F NMRS. Patient response to chemotherapy appeared to correlate with the extent of trapping of free 5FU in the human tumors: in the seven patients receiving 5FU, or 5FU or FUdR plus leucovorin, four of four patients whose tumors trapped 5FU responded to fluorinated pyrimidine chemotherapy, whereas three patients in whom there was a failure to detect tumor trapping were resistant to 5FU. We conclude that NMRS is clinically feasible, and enables investigators to study 5FU pharmacokinetics and metabolism in tumors in vivo. 19F-NMRS of 5FU allows for in vivo evaluation of 5FU metabolic modulation and might be able to guide therapeutic decisions.\r"

  ".W": "The disposition of total and non-protein-bound etoposide was investigated in 21 cancer patients receiving etoposide and cisplatin combination chemotherapy. Etoposide plasma concentrations were determined using a specific high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, and etoposide plasma protein binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis. The patients had a wide range of renal function (creatinine clearance, 32 to 159 mL/min/m2) and hepatic function (total bilirubin range, 0.3 to 21.5 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase [AST] range, 14 to 415 IU/L; serum albumin range, 2.7 to 4.1 g/dL). The mean etoposide total systemic clearance was not different in 15 patients with total bilirubin less than 1.0 mg/dL versus six patients with total bilirubin 1.1 to 21.5 mg/dL (18.7 +/- 5.9 mL/min/m2 v 26.4 +/- 10.7 mL/min/m2; t-test P = .06), with a trend toward higher total clearance in the patients with abnormal bilirubin values. However, the mean clearance of unbound etoposide was significantly lower in patients with increased total bilirubin (220 +/- 90 mL/min/m2 v 135 +/- 61 mL/min/m2; t-test P = .027). The fraction of etoposide unbound (fu) in plasma was significantly higher in patients with increased bilirubin (9% +/- 3% v 27% +/- 15%; t-test P = .002), explaining the trend toward higher total clearance in these patients. Etoposide clearance (total or unbound) in the 14 patients with measurable hepatic metastases was not different from the clearance in the seven patients without hepatic metastases. This study provides an explanation for why patients with increased bilirubin do not have lower total systemic clearance of etoposide, and indicates that such patients have a higher exposure to unbound etoposide. The results of ongoing pharmacodynamic studies of total and unbound etoposide in patients with increased bilirubin will determine the clinical relevance of altered etoposide protein binding.\r"

A variety of chemotherapeutic agents, biologic response modifiers, and antibiotics were administered. In 26% of the patients, the device chambers were in simultaneous use during the treatment period. A 6% incidence of clinical subclavian vein thrombosis was noted. There was no infectious complications. Inconsistencies in blood withdrawal and temporary catheter dysfunction were comparable to other access ports in clinical use. The novel design of this side entry port and the catheter material of low thrombogenicity make this device a good option in patients requiring a low-profile system and dual access. Nursing staff should be made aware of the side entry design and that in-service training for accessing the septum is required in centers where such devices are not routinely used.\r"

Group A patients had solitary resectable metastases, group B patients had multiple, resectable metastases, and group C patients had multiple, unresectable metastases. Patients were randomized to one of two treatment arms within a group: group A-arm A1: resection only, arm A2: resection and continuous hepatic artery infusion (CHAI) of fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR); group B-arm B1: resection and CHAI, arm B2: CHAI only; group C-arm C1: CHAI, arm C2: systemic fluorouracil followed by CHAI. Median time to failure (TTF) was 31.8, 11.1, and 8.8 months for groups A, B, and C, respectively. Arm A2 had an improved TTF when compared with arm A1 (P = .03). Median survival correlated with extent of disease and was 37.3, 22.4, and 13.8 months for groups A, B, and C, respectively. Survival was not changed by treatment variation (arms) within each group. Two- and 5-year cumulative survivals for groups A, B, and C were 72.7% and 45.4%; 45.8% and 16.7%; and 31.7% and 3.2%, respectively. In patients with multiple metastases (groups B and C), those patients whose original tumor was a Dukes' B had a significantly improved TTF and survival over those patients whose tumor was a Dukes' C (P less than or equal to .02).\r"

  ".W": "A33 is a mouse immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that detects a heat-stable, protease- and neuraminidase-resistant epitope. The antigen is homogeneously expressed by virtually all colon cancers and in the colon mucosa but not other epithelial tissues. The biodistribution and imaging characteristics of iodine-131 (131I)-mAbA33 were studied in colorectal carcinoma patients with hepatic metastases. Antibody labeled with 2 to 5 mCi of 131I was administered intravenously (IV) 7 to 8 days before surgery at five dose levels, ranging from 0.2 mg to 50 mg, with three or more patients entered at each dose level. In addition, three patients received 2 mg 131I-mAbTA99 (an isotype-matched control mAb) together with 125I-mAbA33. Evaluation included whole-body imaging with a gamma camera, technetium-99 (99mTc)-human serum albumin blood pool scans, liver/spleen scans, abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scans, hepatic arteriograms, antibody pharmacokinetics, and assessment of antibody distribution in biopsied malignant and normal tissues. Selective mAbA33 localization to tumor tissue was demonstrated in 19 of 20 patients, and external imaging correlated with surgical inspection, pathologic examination, and tissue radioactivity. One week after antibody administration, tumor:liver ratios ranged from 6.9:1 to 100:1 and tumor:serum ratios from 4.1:1 to 25.2:1. 99mTc-albumin blood pool studies showed that liver metastases were hypovascular, emphasizing the selective localization of mAbA33 despite poor tumor-blood flow. Control mAbTA99 studies showed mAbA33 localization was antigen-specific; tumor:liver ratios were 2.3- to 45-fold higher for specific antibody. In metastatic lesions, radioisotope was localized primarily in the viable periphery; however, even the necrotic tumor core concentrated specific antibody. External imaging showed isotope visualization in some patients' large bowel; whether this represents specific antibody uptake or gastric iodine secretion is unclear.\r"

  ".W": "An early phase II study of a new camptothecin analog and an inhibitor of topoisomerase I, CPT-11, was conducted in 62 patients with refractory leukemia and lymphoma by four different treatment schedules in a multiinstitutional cooperative study. CPT-11 therapy resulted in four complete remissions (CRs) and three partial remissions (PRs) in 29 assessable non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients, one PR in three Hodgkin's disease (HD), one CR and one PR in 11 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and one PR in 15 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. Single infusion of 200 mg/m2 every 3 to 4 weeks produced no response in both leukemia and lymphoma patients. Sixty-minute infusions of 40 mg/m2/d for 5 days every 3 to 4 weeks or for 3 days weekly produced four CRs (17%) and four PRs (17%) in 24 patients with malignant lymphoma. Sixty-minute infusions of 20 mg/m2 twice a day for 7 days every 3 to 4 weeks resulted in one CR and two PRs in 12 patients with acute leukemia. No response was seen in an acute leukemia patient by another treatment schedule. CPT-11 was effective in two (15%) of 13 primarily refractory leukemia and lymphoma cases, in two of four relapsed cases, and in seven (17%) of 41 relapsed and refractory cases. Major side effects were leukopenia (91%) and gastrointestinal (GI) (76%). CPT-11 was shown to be effective against refractory leukemia and lymphoma, and thus deserves further clinical study; the novel antitumor activity mode of this drug predicts no cross-resistance to presently available antitumor drugs.\r"

  ".U": "91038183\r", 
  ".W": "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) accounts for approximately 10% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Distinctive features of this disorder at the time of diagnosis include leukopenia coexisting with a marrow replaced with granulated dysplastic promyelocytes, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, lack of Ia (HLA-DR) antigen expression, and translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17 (t[15;17]). Heparin is widely but not universally used to interfere with the coagulopathy during the initial phases of treatment. Serial bone marrow examinations during the induction period demonstrate the achievement of remission despite the persistence of malignant-appearing promyelocytes. Patients with APL are generally younger than those with other subtypes of AML, have a 70% to 80% likelihood of entering remission, and are thought to have a more favorable prognosis than other individuals with AML. Remission may be achieved with a conventional anthracycline-cytarabine combination, anthracycline alone, or, apparently, all-trans retinoic acid. Genes potentially important in myeloid differentiation such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and myeloperoxidase are located close to the breakpoint in the t(15;17) but have not been conclusively shown to be rearranged in the translocation. A better understanding of the unique aspects of APL may well shed light on the pathogenetic processes of AML.\r"

  ".W": "From March 1987 to March 1988, a phase I to II study was carried out in 25 patients with ovarian cancer. They received escalating doses of intraperitoneally (IP) administered yttrium-90 (Y-90)-labeled monoclonal antibody, HMFG1, against a tumor cell-surface antigen. Myelosuppression prevented an escalation of the administered Y-90 activity above 25 mCi. Y-90-labeled antibody was absorbed from the peritoneal cavity into the circulation. Maximum blood Y-90 activity was observed 40 hours after the IP injection with a mean of 21% of the injected activity (range, 14.2% to 26.4%) in the circulation. The radiation dose the bone marrow received from circulating Y-90-labeled antibody (the blood radiation dose) was calculated by applying the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) formulation to the measured Y-90 activity in patients blood. Myelosuppression occurred following calculated blood radiation doses to bone marrow of only 10 to 30 cGy. The excessive myelosuppression following such modest radiation doses from circulating Y-90-labeled antibody could be explained by the uptake of Y-90 by bone. In an attempt to reduce bone absorption of Y-90, seven patients received an intravenous (IV) infusion of EDTA (Sinclair Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Godalming, United Kingdom). This increased the urinary excretion of Y-90 from a mean of 11.1% to 32.3% of the injected activity (P = .0001). Fourteen patients had assessable tumor at laparoscopy. Tumor regression was observed in one patient, and palliation of ascites in a further patient.\r"

On day 1, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide were administered, followed by cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine and methotrexate with leucovorin given on day 8. There were 51 complete remissions (CRs) among 78 previously untreated patients (65%) having clinical stage II-IV disease. The median length of follow-up is 37.9 months with 57% of patients alive at 3 years and 50% of CR patients free of disease at 3 years. Patients with diffuse large-cell lymphoma have the best survival (63% at 3 years) and relapse-free survival (RFS; 68% at 3 years with no relapses seen after 14 months). Administration of ProMACE-CytoBOM is feasible and safe in a cooperative group setting with 84% of 537 courses of treatment given exactly according to schedule and fatal toxicities seen in five patients (6%). ProMACE-CytaBOM may represent improved treatment for diffuse large-cell lymphoma, but the modest differences compared with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) indicate the need for a prospective randomized comparative trial.\r"

Clinical characteristics were compared between histologic (diffuse v nodular) and immunophenotypic (Leu M1 +/L26-, Hodgkin's phenotype, v Leu M1 -/L26+, B-cell phenotype) subgroups. Ten patients have since died, and the median follow-up of the living patients was 14 years (range, 6 to 31). Of the several clinical parameters compared, only axillary nodal presentation was strongly associated with both B-cell phenotype and nodular histology, while male predominance related more to B-cell phenotype than nodular histology. No significant difference in overall survival or relapse rate was apparent among either the histologic or the immunophenotypic subgroups. However, very late but salvageable relapses were associated with nodular histology. The incidences of secondary malignancies and death from Hodgkin's disease (HD) were also comparable between the subgroups. Although difference in clinical presentation may exist, neither the histologic nor the immunophenotypic subcategories of LPHD could be demonstrated to correlate with differences in clinical outcome.\r"

However, defining CR by chest radiograph or computed tomography (CT) is often difficult since residual abnormalities do not always indicate residual disease. We have prospectively evaluated the ability of gallium-67 citrate (Ga-67) imaging to define residual disease and predict outcome in 37 consecutive patients with DLCL. Patients received 296 to 370 megabecquerels (MBq) Ga-67 and were imaged prior to, following cycles 4 to 6, and at completion of intensive chemotherapy. Ga-67 scan results were correlated with radiographic studies. Seventeen of 37 patients (46%) showed persistent, abnormal Ga-67 uptake halfway through chemotherapy. Of these, four were in CR, 11 were in partial remission (PR), and two showed no change in tumor size. At follow-up, 10 (59%) have died (three who were scored as CR and seven who were in PR halfway through therapy), two are alive with active tumor, one relapsed and survives following bone marrow transplant, and four (three in PR and one in CR at the therapeutic halfway point) are without disease at a median of 28 months from presentation. Of the 20 patients who were Ga-67-negative halfway through therapy, 11 were in CR and nine were in PR. Five of 20 patients (25%) have died. Three, in radiographic CR died at 11, 26, and 28 months, and two in radiographic PR died at 15 and 17 months. One patient is alive with active tumor, and 14 patients (70%) are alive without disease at a median of 34 months from presentation. Ga-67 imaging proved to be an excellent indicator of residual viable tumor; a positive scan halfway through therapy predicted for a poor outcome and may well justify a change in treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-four patients aged 2 to 18 years with advanced-stage Hodgkin's disease (HD) were treated on a Children's Cancer Study Group (CCSG) pilot toxicity study (521-P). Therapy consisted of 12 courses of Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), followed by low-dose (2,100 cGy in 12 fractions) regional irradiation (RT). All patients were monitored for toxicity with particular attention to the pulmonary system. Six patients (9%) developed grade 3 or 4 pulmonary toxicity. Three had grade 3 toxicity based solely on changes in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) and remained well for more than 3 years after diagnosis. There was one fatality among the three symptomatic cases. In five cases, toxicity occurred prior to RT. One occurred after seven courses of ABVD, one after nine courses, and three after 10 courses. In one of these five cases, ABVD was stopped. The patient was given nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine), vincristine, prednisone, and procarbazine (MOPP). This patient subsequently developed recurrence of HD and died of overwhelming sepsis. The other four continued on study and completed their chemotherapy. Three patients had no further bleomycin, and one continued bleomycin at 50% of the assigned dose. They all received mantle RT following chemotherapy, one with a boost dose to the mediastinum to 3,800 cGy and one with added RT to both lungs (1,050 cGy). In the sixth case of pulmonary toxicity, symptoms were first noticed 2 weeks after mantle RT to 3,500 cGy. This patient died of progressive respiratory failure. The event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival is 87% at 3 years. These early results indicate that this therapy is effective in advanced HD in children but has a 9% incidence of acute pulmonary toxicity.\r"

Actuarial overall disease-free survival (hereafter designated survival) was 43%. Over 90% of the patients were treated initially with preoperative intraarterial cisplatin (CDP). Postoperative chemotherapeutic regimens comprised high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue (MTX-CF), Adriamycin [( ADR] doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and cyclophosphamide. Primary definitive treatment comprised amputation or limb salvage (TIOS I and TIOS III). Patients treated with preoperative CDP and surgery (TIOS I and III) had a 62% survival. Patients in TIOS II refused surgical extirpation; they were treated exclusively with chemotherapy and had a 23% survival. Survival in patients treated with amputation was 55% and limb salvage 58%. Prognostic factors considered significant in relation to development of pulmonary metastases comprised tumor burden (P = .04) and the percentage of tumor necrosis induced by preoperative chemotherapy (P = .01). Histopathologic subtype was marginally significant: chondroblastic was more favorable as opposed to osteoblastic (P = .05). These findings are compared with results and prognostic factors published in the literature.\r"

  ".U": "91038199\r", 
  ".W": "Children with leukemia and solid tumors are often hospitalized for empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy because of fever during periods of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Conventional practice dictates that parenteral antibiotics be continued until the patient is afebrile and has recovered from neutropenia, ie, until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) exceeds 500 cells per cubic millimeter. However, the practice in our center has been to discontinue parenteral antibiotic therapy and discharge many such patients before resolution of neutropenia. Since the feasibility and safety of this approach has not been studied, we reviewed the records of 114 consecutive hospitalizations for fever and neutropenia in 61 patients during a 13-month period. Seventy-seven children (68%) were discharged to their homes while still neutropenic after they had been afebrile for 1 to 2 days on parenteral antibiotics, had negative blood cultures, appeared well, and usually had some evidence of bone marrow recovery. Five patients (4.4%) developed recurrent fever and required rehospitalization within 7 days of discharge. Only three of the 77 patients (3.9%) who were sent home with neutropenia had recurrent fever. Each had a brief and uneventful second hospitalization. Two of the 37 children discharged with an ANC over 500 cells per cubic millimeter required rehospitalization. A declining ANC and advanced malignancy were risk factors in predicting recurrence of fever following discharge. A rising monocyte count was a predictor of imminent recovery from neutropenia. These results suggest that \"early\" discharge of an afebrile yet still neutropenic patient is safe when the patient is in remission, has no evidence of serious infection, appears clinically stable, and has indications of bone marrow recovery. The conventional approach of routinely continuing the hospitalization until resolution of neutropenia may be unnecessary in such low-risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 96 infants and children with untreated neuroblastomas. Chromosomes of tumor cells were analyzed in 68, and N-myc copy numbers were determined in 67 patients. Patients found by a mass screening program for 6-month-old infants (group A1, 39 patients) or those less than 12 months of age found clinically (group A2, 13 patients) were rarely in the disseminated stage (A1, three of 39; A2 one of 13); their tumors usually had near-triploid (3n) or hypertetraploid (greater than 4n) karyotypes (A1, 28 of 37; A2, nine of 11), and never had N-myc amplification (A1, zero of 34; A2, zero of 11). In contrast, children 12 months or over (group B, 27 patients) were usually in the disseminated stage (19 of 27) (P less than .0001); their tumors usually had near-diploid (2n) or near-tetraploid (4n) karyotypes (16 of 20) (P = .0027), and often had N-myc amplification (nine of 22) (P less than .0001). Of the 40 clinically found patients (A2 and B), six had undergone the screening with a negative result at the age of 6 months. Two of the six patients had N-myc amplification in the tumors. Most tumors found by the screening showed known characteristics predicting a good prognosis, and the majority of tumors showing characteristics predicting a poor prognosis were found in patients aged between 12 and 36 months. Our chromosome and N-myc amplification studies suggest that a low-risk tumor does not usually evolve to a high-risk tumor. Thus, the current mass screening program may be detecting only a small portion of highly malignant neuroblastomas at the earliest stage. Infants should be screened twice, at 6 months as well as at 12 months of age, for the early detection of high-risk neuroblastomas.\r"

There were 31 patients entered and 27 patients assessable for response. The median age was 49 years old. All patients had prior maximal radiotherapy, and eight had previous chemotherapy. Responses were determined based on clinical and computed tomographic (CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria. The response rate (partial response [PR] plus objective qualitative response [OQR] plus complete response [CR]) was 52% with one CR. The response rate was higher in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma as compared with glioblastoma multiforme (P less than .05). The median duration of response was 42 weeks. Median survival for all assessable patients was 30 weeks, and for responders, it was 60 weeks. Response was correlated with ability to decrease dexamethasone doses and improved performance status. Toxicity was mainly hematologic with leukopenia being common. There was one treatment-related death from listeria meningitis, and two patients developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. There were three episodes of neutropenic fever. We conclude that MOP is active and merits further investigation in adult high-grade glioma.\r"

During week 1, 5FU was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion, 750 mg/m2/d for 5 consecutive days. Intravenous bolus administration of 5FU 750 mg/m2 was given weekly for 7 weeks starting on day 12. rIFN alpha-2a (Roferon; Hoffman-LaRoche, Nutley, NJ), 9 x 10(6) U, was administered subcutaneously three times weekly during weeks 1 to 8. Patients were evaluated for response on week 9. Of 52 patients enrolled in the study, 51 were assessable for toxicity, and 45 were assessable for response. Fifteen patients experienced partial response, and one patient achieved a clinical complete response for an overall response rate of 35% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22%, 50%). Median duration of response is 7.5 months (range, 4 to 11 months). Seventy percent of patients entered on the study are alive with a median follow-up duration of 7 months. Twenty-five percent of patients developed grade 4 toxicity, and 82% developed grade 3 toxicity. One drug-related death in the presence of sepsis was reported, and two treatment-related seizures occurred. Our experience with this schedule produced a lower response rate with greater toxicity than previously reported. Current randomized trials comparing this schedule of 5FU with rIFN alpha-2a to 5FU plus folinic acid (leucovorin) or single-agent 5FU may determine its role in the treatment of advanced colorectal carcinomas.\r"

After a median follow-up of 8 years, both relapse-free survival (RFS) and survival (S) were significantly prolonged in premenopausal patients receiving CMF (RFS, P less than .001; S, P = .003). Treatment with CMF resulted in a significant improvement in RFS in premenopausal patients both with steroid receptor-positive and steroid receptor-negative tumors and also in subgroups of premenopausal patients defined by the number of axillary nodes involved. Premenopausal patients who developed permanent amenorrhea following CMF had a significantly better RFS than those who continued to menstruate. Induction of amenorrhea following CMF was related to age, with almost all patients over 40 years becoming amenorrheic. For patients less than or equal to 40 years, development of amenorrhea following CMF did not influence outcome. No difference was detected between control and CMF groups (RFS, P = .9; S, P = .9) in postmenopausal patients nor in any subgroup of these patients. The results of this trial of the efficacy of CMF for improving RFS and S have strengthened with longer follow-up.\r"

We have examined the impact of tumor size, histologic grade, estrogen receptor (ER) status, tumor ploidy, and S-phase fraction (SPF) on relapse-free survival (RFS) for 169 patients with node-negative breast cancer in order to identify groups of patients at high and low risk of relapse. Patients with small tumors (less than or equal to 1.0 cm) had a significantly better RFS than those with larger tumors (P = .005), with 96% remaining relapse-free at 5 years. Patients with tumors less than or equal to 1.0 cm were thus excluded from analysis when attempting to define a group with a poor prognosis. Within the group of patients with tumors greater than 1.0 cm, tumor ploidy (P = .63), ER status (P = .3), or progesterone receptor (PgR) status (P = .24) did not predict for RFS. Patients with grade 1 or 2 infiltrating ductal tumors had a significantly better prognosis than those with grade 3 tumors (P = .04). The prognostic factor that gave the widest separation between subgroups, however, was SPF. Patients whose tumors were greater than 1.0 cm with an SPF less than or equal to 10% had a 5-year RFS of 78% compared with a 5-year RFS of 52% for those with an SPF greater than 10% (P = .006). We have combined tumor size and SPF to identify three prognostic groups: (1) tumor less than or equal to 1.0 cm, 5-year RFS 96%; (2) tumor greater than 1.0 cm plus SPF less than or equal to 10%, 5-year RFS 78%; 3) tumor greater than 1.0 cm plus SPF greater than 10%, 5-year RFS 52%. These prognostic groupings may help identify patients most suitable for adjuvant therapy.\r"

We studied 136 extensive-stage patients in whom traditional staging procedures were performed and in whom other previously demonstrated significant pretreatment variables were determined. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, when all data were included, three variables were significant: performance status (PS) (P = .0001), number of sites of metastases (P = .0010), and age (P = .0029). A prognostic algorithm was developed using these variables, which divided the patients into three distinct groups. When the anatomic staging data were omitted, the serum albumin (P = .0313) was the only variable in addition to PS (P = .0001) and age (P = .0064) that was significant. An alternative algorithm using these three variables was nearly as predictive as the original. Therefore, in extensive-stage patients, reasonable pretreatment prognostic information can be obtained without using the number or specific sites of metastases as variables once the presence of distant metastases has been demonstrated.\r"

  ".W": "Fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin display marked therapeutic synergy in preclinical models and are effective in the treatment of a number of solid tumors when combined and administered intravenously (IV). Each drug has also been administered intraperitoneally (IP) and displays a favorable pharmacologic profile and acceptable clinical toxicity. We therefore undertook a phase I study to determine the feasibility and toxicity of combination IP chemotherapy with these agents. Thirty-one patients with histologically documented malignancy confined to the peritoneal space were treated with cisplatin 90 mg/m2 mixed with 5-FU in 2 L of lactated Ringer's solution and given IP for 4 hours every 28 days. Cohorts of at least three patients received starting 5-FU concentrations ranging from 5 mmol/L (1,300 mg in 2 L) to 20 mmol/L. The dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia with a median granulocyte nadir of 156 cells per microliter occurring at a 5-FU dose of 20 mmol/L. Intrapatient escalation of the 5-FU dose was permitted and 15 cycles of chemotherapy were delivered at 5-FU concentrations greater than 20 mmol/L, the highest concentration being 30.7 mmol/L (8 g of 5-FU in 2L). Other toxicities included mild to moderate nausea during all cycles of therapy, vomiting in 54% of cycles, and diarrhea in 15% of cycles. Abdominal pain, renal dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, and oral mucositis occurred infrequently and were not related to the 5-FU dose. Peritoneal fluid and plasma 5-FU concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in selected patients. Mean peak plasma 5-FU concentrations ranged from 6.19 mumol/L to greater than 60 mumol/L, and peritoneal fluid to plasma 5-FU area under the curve (AUC) ratios ranged from 85 to 1,150. Nine of 15 patients with nonbulky disease had resolution of malignant ascites or at least a 50% reduction of peritoneal studding by tumor at repeat laparotomy. We conclude that combination IP chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-FU is technically feasible and has acceptable clinical toxicity and a favorable pharmacologic profile. The recommended starting 5-FU dose for phase II trials is 3,900 mg mixed with 90 mg/m2 of cisplatin in 2 L of isotonic fluid.\r"

Quantitative analysis of this interaction provides a basis for understanding the biology of therapeutic cell kill as well as a rational strategy for optimizing and predicting tumor response. Recent advances have made it possible to correlate assayed DNA lesions with cytotoxicity in tumor cell lines, in animal models, and in patients with malignant disease. In addition, many of the complex interrelationships between DNA damage, DNA repair, and alterations of gene expression in response to DNA damage have been defined. Techniques for modulating DNA damage and cytotoxicity using schedule-specific cytotoxic combinations, DNA repair inhibitors, cell-cycle manipulations, and adjunctive noncytotoxic drug therapy are being developed, and critical therapeutic targets have been identified within tumor-cell subpopulations and genomic DNA alike. Most importantly, methods for predicting clinical response to cytotoxic therapy using both in vitro markers of tumor-cell sensitivity and in vivo measurements of drug-induced DNA damage are now becoming a reality. These advances can be expected to provide a strong foundation for the development of innovative cytotoxic drug strategies over the next decade.\r"

  ".W": "The theoretical aspects of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast agents are reviewed, and their current applications to the central nervous system (CNS) and their future applications are discussed. Profound differences exist between contrast agents used for MR imaging and computerized tomography (CT). In MR imaging, the contrast agents are not imaged directly but rather act on adjacent protons to shorten T1 and T2 relaxation times. This in turn results in signal intensity changes. The lanthanide metal, gadolinium, in the form of gadopentetate dimeglumine, has been found to be both safe and efficacious as the only currently approved contrast agent for MR imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging revolutionized the detection and treatment of disease affecting the brain and spine. Initially, it was thought that signal characteristics on MR imaging would allow differentiation of specific pathology. It was soon found that MR studies were able to detect more abnormalities but were less able to characterize them. The recent development of contrast agents for MR imaging has allowed this modality to surpass CT for the evaluation of most CNS lesions. At present, contrast-enhanced MR imaging is generally accepted as the study of choice for evaluating acoustic neurinomas, pituitary lesions, meningeal disease, primary and secondary brain tumors, active multiple sclerosis, intradural spinal neoplasms, intramedullary spinal disease, and postoperative states in both the spine and brain. Even when contrast-enhanced CT can detect the same abnormalities, evaluation of the lesions in multiple planes on MR imaging can sometimes yield invaluable information, especially prior to surgery. Future developments of contrast material for MR imaging include non-gadolinium compounds, intrathecal contrast media, cerebral blood flow and volume evaluation, and, possibly, antibody-labeled contrast agents.\r"

  ".W": "Anterior clinoidal meningiomas are frequently grouped with suprasellar or sphenoid ridge meningiomas, masking their notorious association with a high mortality and morbidity rate, failure of total removal, and recurrence. To avoid injury to encased cerebral vessels, most surgeons are content with subtotal removal. Without total removal, however, recurrence is expected. Recent advances in cranial-base exposure and cavernous sinus surgery have facilitated radical total removal. The author reports 24 cases operated on with vigorous attempts at total removal of the tumor with involved dura and bone. This experience has distinguished three groups (I, II, and III) which influence surgical difficulties, the success of total removal, and outcome. These subgroups relate to the presence of interfacing arachnoid membranes between the tumor and cerebral vessels. The presence or absence of arachnoid membranes depends on the origin of the tumor and its relation to the naked segment of carotid artery lying outside the carotid cistern. Total removal was impossible in the three patients in Group I, with postoperative death occurring in one patient and hemiplegia in another. Total removal was achieved in 18 of the 19 patients in Group II, with one death from pulmonary embolism. In the two patients in Group III, total removal without complications was easily achieved.\r"

  ".W": "Among 91 patients with unruptured intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM's), 16 patients had 26 unruptured intracranial saccular aneurysms. An actuarial analysis showed the risk of intracranial hemorrhage among patients with coexisting aneurysm and AVM to be 7% per year at 5 years following diagnosis compared to 1.7% for patients with AVM alone. The difference in length of survival free of hemorrhage was significant (log-rank, p less than 0.0007). Several angiographic and clinical parameters were investigated to better understand the relationship of these lesions. The aneurysms occurred in similar percentages in patients with small, medium, and large AVM's. Twenty-five aneurysms were on arteries feeding the malformation system, almost equally distributed proximally and distally. Eleven aneurysms were atypical in location, and all arose from primary or secondary branch feeders to the malformation; 24 were on enlarged feeding arteries. Eleven (16%) of the 67 patients with high-flow AVM's had associated aneurysms, compared with five (21%) of the 24 patients with low-flow AVM's. Four (16%) of 25 low-shunt malformations and 12 (18%) of 65 high-shunt malformations had associated aneurysms. All five aneurysms associated with low-shunt malformations were on a direct arterial feeder of the malformation. These data suggest that the intracranial AVM's predispose to aneurysm formation within AVM feeding systems and that the mechanism is not simply based upon the high blood flow or high arteriovenous shunt in these systems.\r"

  ".W": "The magnetic resonance longitudinal relaxation time (T1) and transverse relaxation time (T2) of the water proton of the periventricular white and cortical gray matter were measured for 17 control patients and 21 patients with suspected normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Of the latter group, 14 showed good response to shunting (true-NPH group) and seven showed no response (false-NPH group). In the true-NPH group, both the T1 and the T2 of the periventricular white matter were significantly prolonged compared to the control values, and slowly shortened after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting. The true-NPH group showed significantly longer T1 and T2 of the white matter than did the false-NPH group. The T1 and T2 of the white matter were longer than those of the gray matter in this group, which was the reverse of the relationship observed in the control patients. In the white matter of the false-NPH group, there was a significant prolongation of T1 only; no difference was seen in the T2 compared to control values. There was no change in either T1 or T2 of this region after CSF shunting. The false-NPH group showed no significant difference in either T1 or T2 between the white and the gray matter. There was no difference in either T1 or T2 of the gray matter between the false-NPH and control groups or between preshunt and postshunt measurements in each patient group. It is suggested that a distinction between true- and false-NPH, which cannot be made from the radiographic appearance alone, may be possible from measurement of relaxation times. The mechanism of varied relaxation behavior between two entities may be explained by a difference in properties of the biological water and its environment.\r"

The transfer function is a measure of how much pressure is transmitted through the CVB at a given frequency and is calculated using Fourier analysis of the pressure waveforms. The transfer function allows quantification of the pressure transmission performance of the CVB, thus providing a basis for comparison between normal and abnormal function. Fifteen hundred samples of ICP and BP waveforms were collected from 30 head-injured patients via microcomputer. Off-line spectral analysis of the waveform database revealed four main classes of transfer function: those with an overall flat transfer function (curve type 1); those with an elevated low-frequency response (curve type 2); those with an elevated high-frequency response (curve type 3); and those exhibiting both an elevated low- and high-frequency response (curve type 4). Curve types 2 and 4 were most often associated with raised ICP (greater than 20 mm Hg), whereas curve types 1 and 3 were most often affiliated with ICP less than 15 mm Hg. Studies of this type may provide insight into the pathophysiology of the CVB and ultimately aid in the prediction and treatment of raised ICP.\r"

  ".U": "91038296\r", 
  ".W": "To better understand the cellular mechanism of tumor invasion, the production of a cell motility-stimulating factor by malignant glioma cells was studied in vitro. Serum-free conditioned media from cultures of rat C6 and human T98G cell lines contained a factor that stimulated the locomotion of the producer cells. This factor was termed the \"glioma-derived motility factor.\" The glioma-derived motility factor is a heat-labile protein with a molecular weight greater than 10 kD and has relative stability to acid. The factor showed not only chemotactic activity but also chemokinetic (stimulated random locomotion) activity in the two types of glioma cells studied. Although glioma-derived motility factors in conditioned media obtained from two different cell origins are likely to be the same, chemokinetic migration of T98G cells to their conditioned medium was much stronger than that of C6 cells to theirs. Coincubation of cells with cytochalasin B, which disrupts the assembly of cellular actin microfilaments, almost completely inhibited the cell migration stimulated by glioma-derived motility factor. Cytochalasin B also induced marked alterations in cell morphology, including cell retraction and arborization, while the drug did not affect cell attachment to culture dishes. These results indicate that glioma cells produce a motility factor which may play a role particularly when tumor cells are detached and migrate away from the original tumor mass, thus promoting tumor invasion. Also, glioma cell migration stimulated by the motility factor requires the normal organization of cytoskeletons such as actin microfilaments.\r"

  ".W": "An increase in extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]c) of the rat hippocampus following fluid-percussion concussive brain injury was demonstrated with microdialysis. The role of neuronal discharge was examined with in situ administration of 0.1 mM tetrodotoxin, a potent depressant of neuronal discharges, and of 0.5 to 20 mM cobalt, a blocker of Ca++ channels. While a small short-lasting [K+]c increase (1.40- to 2.15-fold) was observed after a mild insult, a more pronounced longer-lasting increase (4.28- to 5.90-fold) was induced without overt morphological damage as the severity of injury rose above a certain threshold (unconscious for 200 to 250 seconds). The small short-lasting increase was reduced with prior administration of tetrodotoxin but not with cobalt, indicating that neuronal discharges are the source of this increase. In contrast, the larger longer-lasting increase was resistant to tetrodotoxin and partially dependent on Ca++, suggesting that neurotransmitter release is involved. In order to test the hypothesis that the release of the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate mediates this increase in [K+]c, the extracellular concentration of glutamate ([Glu]c) was measured along with [K+]c. The results indicate that a relatively specific increase in [Glu]c (as compared with other amino acids) was induced concomitantly with the increase in [K+]c. Furthermore, the in situ administration of 1 to 25 mM kynurenic acid, an excitatory amino acid antagonist, effectively attenuated the increase in [K+]c. A dose-response curve suggested that a maximum effect of kynurenic acid is obtained at a concentration that substantially blocks all receptor subtypes of excitatory amino acids. These data suggest that concussive brain injury causes a massive K+ flux which is likely to be related to an indiscriminate release of excitatory amino acids occurring immediately after brain injury.\r"

The reactivities of this antibody with various human glioma tissues and cultured glioma cells and the characterization of the antigen recognized by CLN-IgG on malignant glioma cells were analyzed and reported. CLN-IgG reacted with various human glioma cells and glioma tissues, especially glioblastoma, but did not react with normal brain tissues or fetal brain tissues. A large amount of antigen recognized by CLN-IgG was expressed on cell membranes of undifferentiated glioma cells and of glioma cells at the G2/M tumor growth phase in cycling cells. Antigen recognized by CLN-IgG was detected in only one of seven samples of cyst fluid, and was not detected in 27 serum samples or 18 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from glioma patients. CLN-IgG exhibited antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity against U-25 1 MG glioma cells and primary cultured cells of glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas. These data suggest that the antigen recognized by CLN-IgG might be related to cell proliferation in malignant gliomas. Thus, CLN-IgG might be useful for immunotherapy or immunoimaging of malignant gliomas.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effects of focal neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser irradiation (lambda = 1060 nm) on regional cerebral blood flow, cerebral protein synthesis, and blood-brain barrier permeability, the parietal brain surface of 44 rats was irradiated with a focused laser beam at a constant output energy of 30 J. Survival times ranged from 5 minutes to 48 hours. Laser irradiation immediately caused well-defined cortical coagulation necrosis. Within 5 minutes after unilateral irradiation, 14C-iodoantipyrine autoradiographs demonstrated severely reduced blood flow to the irradiation site and perilesional neocortex, but a distinct reactive hyperemia in all other areas of the forebrain. Apart from a persistent ischemic focus in the vicinity of the cortical coagulation necrosis, blood flow alterations in remote areas of the brain subsided within 3 hours after irradiation. Autoradiographic assessment of 3H-tyrosine incorporation into brain proteins revealed rapid onset and prolonged duration of protein synthesis inhibition in perifocal morphologically intact cortical and subcortical structures. Impairment of amino acid incorporation proved to be completely reversible within 48 hours. Immunoautoradiographic visualization of extravasated plasma proteins using 3H-labeled rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulins-showed that, up to 1 hour after irradiation, immunoreactive proteins were confined to the neocortex at the irradiation site. At 4 hours, vasogenic edema was present in the vicinity of the irradiation site and the subcortical white matter, and, at later stages (16 to 36 hours), also extended into the contralateral hemisphere. Although this was followed by a gradual decrease in labeling intensity, resolution of edema was still not complete after 48 hours. Analysis of sequential functional changes in conjunction with morphological alterations indicates that the evolution of morphological damage after laser irradiation does not correlate with the time course and spatial distribution of protein synthesis inhibition or vasogenic edema. Although the central coagulation necrosis represents a direct effect of radiation, the final size of the laser-induced lesion is determined by a delayed colliquation necrosis due to persistent perifocal ischemia. Extent and severity of ischemia in a zone with initial preservation of neuroglial cells can be explained by the optical properties of the Nd:YAG laser; extensive scattering of light within brain parenchyma associated with a high blood-to-brain absorption ratio selectively affects blood vessels outside the irradiation focus.\r"

Five other hemiparkinsonian monkeys underwent caudate cavitation, but received no tissue implant. All of the animals had marked bradykinesia of the affected arm and stable apomorphine-induced turning before cavitation or implantation. Moderate behavioral recovery was seen in all five monkeys with cavitation and two of the three monkey with long-term adrenal autografts (the fourth adrenal recipient was sacrificed 10 days after grafting). The improvement occurred months after the procedure and was not as early or as complete as that seen after fetal dopaminergic grafts. Surviving adrenal tissue was found only in the animal that showed no behavioral recovery. The other two adrenal autograft recipients (with no surviving adrenal medulla) and all of the animals with cavitation had ingrowth of dopaminergic fibers from the area olfactoria and nucleus accumbens into the caudate, oriented toward the cavity. These findings show that the mechanism of improvement after adrenal medullary implants for parkinsonism is not dopamine secretion by chromaffin cells, but may be related to the sprouted host fibers. The results also indicate that the limited recovery after adrenal implants in parkinsonian patients may be a result of the cavitation, and not necessarily the result of tissue implantation.\r"

Energy failure occurred at an average AVDO2 of 8.4 +/- 3.2 vol% (+/- standard deviation) (range 4.7 to 14.7 vol%). The VO2 at the point of metabolic failure averaged 1.45 +/- 0.6 vol% and extended over a narrower range (1.0 to 2.9 vol%). In an additional six cats, ICP was raised to the threshold of metabolic failure and hyperventilation was then instituted (pCO2 10 to 18 torr). Five of the six cats experienced a drop in VO2 with hyperventilation. In two of these animals, hyperventilation resulted in a VO2 of 1.1 vol% or less and in metabolic failure as evidenced by a fall in phosphocreatine. It is concluded that a VO2 of less than 2 vol% is correlated with brain ischemia and that the safety of hyperventilation in the setting of increased ICP can be monitored by the use of VO2.\r"

  ".W": "Two types of artificial membranes, a medical-grade aliphatic polyurethane and a polysiloxane-carbonate block copolymer, were tested as substitutes for dura in 24 and 12 rabbits, respectively. The films were placed either epidurally, subdurally, or as dural grafts in equal subgroups of animals. The postoperative course was uneventful with no manifestations of convulsive disorder or cerebrospinal fluid leak. The animals were sacrificed 3, 6, or 9 months after implantation of the artificial membranes. Both types of artificial membranes were easily removed from the underlying nervous and the other surrounding tissues. The histological examination failed to reveal adhesions, neomembrane formations, or any type of foreign body reactions to the polyurethane film. The implantation of the polysiloxane-carbonate film caused no reaction when it was applied epidurally. As a dural graft, the polysiloxane-carbonate copolymer induced the formation of a thin neomembrane of one to two layers of fibroblasts which formed a watertight seal of the dural defect. A similar thin neomembrane was found to encase this artificial membrane in the group of animals in which it was implanted subdurally. There was no foreign body reaction to the polysiloxane-carbonate film. The authors conclude that these materials hold promise as dural substitutes or in the prevention of spinal dural scarring, and should be evaluated clinically.\r"

A female infant, the product of normal labor and delivery, demonstrated severe ventriculomegaly and an intracranial hemorrhage at birth. Cerebral angiography at 5 days of age revealed several large fistulae fed by the anterior and middle cerebral arteries draining into the deep venous system through a dilated internal cerebral vein and ectatic vein of Galen. Two days following the angiogram, a second intracranial hemorrhage occurred. Active hydrocephalus developed over the next 6 months and was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting. When the child was 8 months of age, angiography failed to demonstrate the fistulae. It was postulated that pressure effects from the intracranial hematoma and long-standing intracranial hypertension as well as stenosis in the anomalous venous outflow resulted in vascular stasis, venous thrombosis, and selective arterial occlusion. Hydrocephalus was a result of the compression of the intraventricular foramina by dilated embryonic vessels. This anomaly, predominantly involving the anterior circulation, may be homologous to the vein of Galen aneurysm in the posterior circulation.\r"

Accordingly, we systematically evaluated regional myocardial FDG accumulation in comparison with regional myocardial perfusion assessed with oxygen-15-water and oxidative metabolism assessed with carbon-11-acetate in nine normal subjects (four studied after a 5-hr fast and five studied both fasted and following glucose loading). Under fasting conditions, myocardial accumulation of FDG in the septum and anterior wall averaged 80% of that in the lateral and posterior walls (p less than 0.03). In contrast, after glucose loading the regional distribution of myocardial FDG accumulation became more homogeneous. Regional myocardial perfusion, oxidative metabolism, and accumulation of carbon-11-acetate were homogeneous under both conditions. Thus, under fasting conditions there are regional variations in myocardial accumulation of FDG, which are visually apparent, are not associated with concomitant changes in oxidative metabolism or perfusion, and cannot be attributed to partial-volume effects. This significant heterogeneity may limit the specificity of PET with FDG for detecting myocardial ischemia in fasting subjects.\r"

The patients were found to have 85 fixed and 124 reversible defects, as determined by visual interpretation. Reversibility bull's-eye polar maps were compared to gender-matched normal limits from 36 normals. Regions were identified as reversible if their normalized difference between stress and 4 hr greater than 1.5 s.d.s. from the mean normal limits. Overall agreement between experts at multicenter sites and reversibility maps was 73% for reversible defects and 80% of fixed defects. Sensitivity in detecting reversibility was highest for the left circumflex (88%) and lowest for the right coronary (60%). These results indicate that reversibility polar maps and normal limits offer an objective, accurate technique for determining the reversibility of stress-induced perfusion defects.\r"

In 21 volunteers and in 70 patients with osteoporosis, the ST variations were larger than the expected random error, revealing a source of error related to the inhomogeneity of soft tissue. The estimation error in BMC caused by ST variations was 0.7% in healthy subjects (mean BMC 40.5 gHA) and 1.5% in patients (mean BMC = 26.4 gHA). These results indicate that ST-related errors are an important limit to the precision of lumbar DPA measurements.\r"

Small cell carcinomas showed concentrations between 1.09 and 8.85 %ID/cc x 10(-3) while non-small cell lung tumors showed a concentration variation between 0.36 and 6.75 %ID/cc x 10(-3). In contrast to the situation in human tumors, uptake in mouse tumors showed only slight variability in animals with the same tumor model. EMT-6 tumors in mice showed at 6 hr significantly higher uptake of Co-bleo (p less than 0.001) and significantly higher tumor-to-lung ratio (p less than 0.001) when compared to murine fibrosarcomas. The EMT-6 tumors in contrast to the fibrosarcomas responded to bleomycin treatment in a dose dependent manner. The results indicate that while in mice the tumor dose closely follows the administered dose, in humans, the tumor dose and the tumor-to-lung ratio in the individual patient cannot be predicted from the administered dose.\r"

Two to 3 days later, 111In-labeled biotin was also administered intravenously. No evidence of toxicity was observed. Background radioactivity levels were reduced in liver (1% ID at 24 hr) and kidneys (2%) and in all other normal tissues and blood. Images of lung tumor were obtained in as little as 2 hr following administration of labeled biotin. In eight patients, tumor was detected with labeled biotin alone without the previous administration of streptavidin-conjugated antibody but in three of these patients, the images were improved with the prior administration of conjugated antibody. These results suggest that this approach may improve the tumor-to-normal tissue radioactivity ratios in radioimmunotargeting.\r"

Seventeen patients with different nephrologic disorders or hypertension were first studied with OIH and then reinvestigated with MAG3 2-8 days later. Renal MAG3 gamma camera images were almost identical with those of OIH except for higher (p less than 0.01) liver-to-background ratios at 20 min postinjection, irrespective of kidney function. Urinary peristalsis was visible longer and more clearly in the MAG3 studies. MAG3 and OIH renograms showed identical relative kidney uptake (r = 0.99), but elimination of MAG3 from the kidneys was slower (p less than 0.01). The plasma clearance of MAG3 was lower than that of OIH, but correlated (r = 0.92) significantly. The plasma distribution volume and content in blood cells was lower (p less than 0.01), but the binding of MAG3 to plasma proteins was higher, 90%, as compared with 74% for OIH, p less than 0.01. Urinary excretion expressed as a percent of the given dose 60 min after injection was the same for the two substances. Thus, there are some significant differences in the renal handling, plasma distribution, and cell penetration between MAG3 and [123I]OIH. MAG3, however, seems to have particular qualifications as a radionuclide for dynamic renal scintigraphy, especially in patients who require acute investigations or in those with low renal function.\r"

In the mouse myocardium, DNP decreased the intracellular ATP and ADP levels, without affecting either acyl-CoA synthetase activity or the level of CoA-SH. Following treatment with DNP, decreases in myocardial BMIPP accumulation correlated well with those of ATP, while 201Tl-Cl showed slightly increased accumulation in the myocardium.

  ".W": "The metabolism of beta-methyl-[1-14C]heptadecanoic acid, a potential myocardial imaging agent, was investigated in perfused hearts and livers from rats. Hepatic uptake is approximately 4.5 times greater than cardiac uptake. In the heart, 66% of beta-methyl-heptadecanoic acid metabolism occurs via omega-oxidation, 33% by esterification and less than 1% via alpha-oxidation. In contrast, 53% of hepatic metabolism of beta-methyl-heptadecanoic acid occurs via alpha-oxidation, 27% via omega-oxidation, and 20% via esterification. Perfusion of hearts and livers with concentrations of beta-methyl-heptadecanoic acid 100 to 1000 times greater than that used for myocardial imaging does not alter any of the physiological and biochemical parameters measured. In the perfused liver, 3-methyl-[1-14C]glutarate was identified as the principal hydrosoluble catabolite of beta-methyl-heptadecanoic acid.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the potential of FDG for PET imaging of nodal tumor metastases, we evaluated its uptake into normal lymph nodes, tumor-involved lymph nodes, and subcutaneous tumor xenografts in rodents. Normal lymph nodes in mice and rats accumulate FDG moderately, developing node/blood ratios of 1.3-11.9/1 at 2 hr following i.v. injection. By contrast, FDG given subcutaneously to healthy Sprague Dawley rats developed very high normal draining lymph node/blood ratios (272/1) versus 7.7/1 by i.v. injection. In nude mice, subcutaneous human ovarian cancer xenografts had 1.27-fold more uptake relative to blood than did normal popliteal lymph nodes. Subcutaneous tumor xenografts of rat breast cancer developed tumor/normal node uptake ratios of 4.91 +/- 0.43/1 and tumor/blood ratios of 6.6 +/- 0.9 at 2 hr postinjection. Mouse nodes involved with 38C13 murine B-cell lymphoma had mean node/blood ratios of 42.9 +/- 6.7/1 and tumored node/normal lymph node uptake of 6.3/1. Thus, FDG given intravenously but not subcutaneusly (due to high normal nodal uptake) has potential as an agent for the detection of metastatic tumors in regional lymph nodes using PET scanning.\r"

The sine and cosine coefficients of the first harmonic are extracted from the gated views and reconstructed. This, in fact, results in an improvement of the count statistics by a factor of four combined with a tremendous reduction of disc space requirements. Using short-axis slices, bull's-eye plots of the amplitude and phase of the left ventricle are calculated. Cardiac functions and localization and extent of any malfunction are documented three-dimensionally without superposition.\r"

This program was used to process the data obtained from 17 normal subjects, 20 min, 2 hr, and 4 hr after the injection of iodine-labeled iodoamphetamines. The mean absolute cortical uptake at these three time periods was 0.921 (+/- 0.185), 0.803 (+/- 0.107), and 0.748 (+/- 0.103) in arbitrary units (+/- s.d.), respectively. The regional distribution of the tracer became more uniform with time due to an uneven washout rate. The cerebellum was noted to have a very high variability in its uptake and a high washout rate, making it unsuitable as an internal standard for relative quantification. Finally, a repeat study was performed on 10 subjects. No significant difference could be demonstrated in the mean uptake of the group at 2 and 4 hr, however the difference observed in the 20 min uptake values was significant at the p = 0.05 level.\r"

A dynamic phantom model was used containing two hips and a bladder. The phantom was studied under three conditions--bladder empty, filling, and full. The ability of the pixel truncation and interpolative background replacement techniques to eliminate bladder artifacts was assessed. Both techniques gave similar results and resulted in significant (but not complete) recovery of activity in the hips. Quantitative analysis of pixel counts over each hip shows that the measured activity was variable and approximately 20%-30% less than that seen in the empty bladder study. The use of left/right ratio to quantitate differences in hip activity was highly inaccurate despite the use of these filtering techniques. In summary, while these techniques significantly improve image quality, caution should be exercised, particularly in the evaluation of the medial aspects of the hips.\r"

In 10 normal subjects (n = 20 studies), myocardial 11C clearance rate constants (k) averaged 0.057 +/- 0.009 (per minute). Regional k-values varied only 10.6 +/- 2.4% in the normal left ventricle. However, there was a small but significant segmental variation with increased 11C clearance in the septal, anterior, and basal regions (p less than 0.05). Since 11C clearance rates reflect tri-carboxylic acid cycle flux, these results suggest that myocardial oxidative metabolism is relatively homogeneous in the normal human heart at rest with minor regional variations, which possibly reflect varying regional wall stresses or substrate utilization. The proposed approach provides three-dimensional evaluation of regional oxidative metabolism which will permit characterization of the location, extent, and severity of myocardial disease.\r"

CT images are read from magnetic tape and are displayed on a high-resolution color graphics display monitor. Source tissue geometries are defined on a series of contiguous CT images automatically (by an edge detection algorithm) or manually (using a trackball), thereby obtaining a three-dimensional representation of the various source volumes of activity. Dose calculations are performed using a radionuclide-specific absorbed dose point kernel in the form of a lookup table. The method described yields the spatially varying dose delivered to tumor and normal tissue volumes from a patient-specific cumulated activity distribution in a clinically implementable manner. This level of accuracy in determining normal tissue and tumor doses may prove valuable in the evaluation and implementation of radionuclides and radiolabeled compounds for therapeutic purposes.\r"

Rats were fed diets containing 14% fish oil, safflower oil or beef fat plus 2% corn oil. These diets were fed ad libitum for 4 wk (first phase). A number of the animals from each group were killed, and the others were fed 50% of their first-phase food intake for an additional 4 wk (second phase). The diets used in the second phase contained 3% of the above fats plus 2% corn oil. Food consumption, food efficiency and body weights were monitored. After the rats were killed, fatty acid composition of epididymal fat pads was examined. In addition, in vivo lipolysis and in vitro lipogenesis in epididymal fat pads were examined. The results indicate that dietary fatty acid composition had no effect on body weight, food consumption, in vivo lipolysis and in vitro lipogenesis in epididymal fat pads. In addition, although dietary fatty acid manipulation resulted in alteration in adipose tissue fatty acid composition, it had no effect on the rate of weight loss, body composition, in vivo lipolysis and in vitro lipogenesis in epididymal fat pads. It is concluded that dietary fatty acid composition does not play a role in body composition and in lipid metabolism in adipose tissue of mature rats.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of prickly pear soluble fiber on low density lipoprotein (LDL) metabolism was investigated by feeding male guinea pigs either a nonpurified diet containing 0.25% cholesterol (HC diet) or the HC diet + 1% prickly pear pectin (HC-P diet). Plasma cholesterol levels were significantly decreased by the HC-P diet, with a 33% decrease in LDL levels (p less than 0.02) and an increase in LDL density. Hepatic free and esterified cholesterol levels were reduced 40 and 85%, respectively (p less than 0.002), by the HC-P diet. Hepatic microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase levels were not different. 125I-LDL binding to hepatic membranes was increased 1.7-fold by the HC-P diet (p less than 0.001), with receptor affinity (Kd) being unaltered and receptor number (Bmax) being significantly increased (p less than 0.001). These data suggest that prickly pear pectin may act by a mechanism similar to that of bile acid-binding resins in lowering plasma cholesterol levels. The observed reduction in LDL and hepatic cholesterol levels and increase in LDL density and hepatic apolipoprotein B/E receptors are responses suggesting an increased demand on hepatic cholesterol from increased excretion of bile acids and interruption of the enterohepatic circulation.\r"

The rats were meal-fed isoenergetic diets based on safflower oil or beef tallow for 4 mo. Each diet was freshly prepared every day throughout the experimental period. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production for 6 h after meals were measured between the 50th and 54th d of the experimental period. Oxygen consumption for 3 h after meals was significantly greater in the safflower oil diet group than in the beef tallow diet group, indicating greater diet-induced thermogenesis in the former group. From the assessment of respiratory quotient, the fat oxidation rate was also higher in the former. After the experimental period (4 mo), body fat accumulation was significantly less in the rats fed safflower oil. This difference was, at least in part, ascribed to increased diet-induced thermogenesis and fat oxidation. Serum triacylglycerol level was markedly lower in the rats fed safflower oil than in those fed beef tallow. The lipoprotein lipase activities in heart and soleus muscle after meals appeared to be higher in the former than in the latter. These results suggest that the consumption of the safflower oil diet increased lipoprotein lipase activity in heart and skeletal muscle, resulting in the elevation of fat oxidation rate and the depression of serum triacylglycerol level.\r"

The serum from mice fed PG + SO gave a response similar to that with calf serum. Sera were separated into lipoprotein and aqueous fractions by centrifugation. A combination of both the lipoprotein and aqueous fractions of serum from mice fed PG + SO was required for the increased response. Proteolysis of the aqueous fraction of the serum from either mice fed PG or rats fed 30% hydrogenated coconut oil (HCO) reduced the amount of cAMP produced by the thyroid cells. However, the same effect was not seen with aqueous fractions of calf serum or serum from mice fed PG + SO or rats fed HCO plus 5% corn oil. These findings suggest that there are at least three factors in serum capable of regulating thyroid cell metabolism that are controlled by the type of fat fed the animal.\r"

We have explored whether the venous postprandial amino acid profile reflects differences in the amino acid composition of the protein consumed. Six adult Gottingen miniature pigs were fed a semisynthetic diet based on either casein or soy protein isolate. Frequent blood sampling was performed over a whole day after consumption of each diet for 6 wk. Postprandial plasma amino acid concentrations reached their maxima within the first 3 h. A group of eight protein amino acids (Met, Arg, Tyr, Val, Trp, Leu, Lys and Cys) exhibited the most marked and significant protein-dependent differences during this early postprandial phase, whereas Thr and His showed less marked differences. With one exception (Ser) all protein amino acids exhibited venous plasma concentration changes in qualitative accordance with their content in the dietary protein consumed. In quantitative terms, however, venous plasma amino acid changes were less marked than expected from the amino acid composition of the dietary proteins. We conclude that neither the considerable number of amino acids showing differences as reported herein nor the multitude of contradictory reported by others concerning single amino acids affecting serum cholesterol favor the hypothesis that one or several amino acid(s) cause protein-induced hypercholesterolemia.\r"

Some studies have found that high levels of dietary fat increase fecal bile acid excretion, whereas others report no effect. Wheat bran appears to reduce fecal bile acid concentration. This study was conducted to determine the effect of different dietary fat levels and types of wheat bran on bile acid metabolism. Rats were fed diets containing either no fiber, 2% cholestyramine (CHO) or brans of hard red spring, soft white winter or durum wheat--at both a 5 or 20% fat level. Animals were fed for 7 wk, and feces were collected in the last week. Wheat bran (all types) significantly increased fecal mass approximately fourfold, and CHO significantly increased fecal mass twofold compared to the fiber-free diet. Increasing the fat level did not increase fecal bile acid excretion, nor did the addition of wheat bran. Addition of CHO, however, more than doubled it. CHO increased fecal bile acid concentration, all wheat brans decreased it and fat level had no effect. Bile acid pool size was increased slightly by fat level and cholestyramine feeding but not by wheat brans. These results indicate that fat level slightly alters bile acid metabolism but that wheat brans do not.\r"

The daily intake of fruits, vegetables and potatoes was 505 and 1235 g with the low and the high fiber diets, respectively. Normally, young German women consume only 350 g of these foods each day. Dietary fiber intake was 18.8 g/d with the low fiber diet and 52.0 g/d with the high fiber diet. Daily gross energy intakes were 8540 and 8916 kJ (2041 and 2131 kcal) with the low and the high fiber diets, respectively. The apparent digestibility of energy was lower when the high fiber diet was consumed. Measured ME was 7665 and 7544 kJ/d (1831 and 1802 kcal/d) with the low and high fiber diets, respectively. It was calculated that fiber from fruits and vegetables contributed to ME about 3 kJ (0.7 kcal) per gram of fiber. On the average, the ME of the low fiber diet could be predicted by all calculation procedures except the formula of Miller and Judd. The ME of the high fiber diet could best be predicted by the specific factors of Merrill and Watt and by the Southgate formula.\r"

We investigated the relationship between dietary level of pyridoxine hydrochloride (PN-HCl) and concentrations of PLP in blood and PLP and PMP in liver and brain of mice. Female heterogeneous stock mice, 60 to 90 d old, were fed purified diets containing 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, or 7.0 mg PN-HCl/kg diet for 5 wk. PLP and PMP concentrations were determined by a spectrophotometric apotryptophanase assay. PLP content of plasma, erythrocytes, whole blood, liver and brain and PMP levels in liver and brain were highly correlated with dietary level of PN-HCl (r values ranged from 0.81 to 0.94, n per correlation = 32 to 43). By using the entire range of dietary levels of PN-HCl, both plasma and erythrocyte PLP were found to be significantly correlated with tissue PLP and PMP concentrations. For any one dietary level, however, correlations between plasma or erythrocyte PLP and tissue PLP and PMP concentrations were low and nonsignificant. These results suggest that plasma PLP levels may be suitable to determine vitamin B-6 status of populations, but not to reliably predict tissue concentrations of PLP or PMP in individuals.\r"

Data obtained from men (n = 224) and women (n = 217) aged 65-79 (nationwide sample in the Netherlands) were used for this purpose. Although alcohol intake (a maximum of 21% of the energy came from alcohol) tended to be positively associated with PLP, this association never reached statistical significance (p greater than or equal to 0.05). EAST-AC was inversely associated with alcohol intake, whether or not it was adjusted for vitamin B-6 and protein intake. Similar results were found for the total EAST activity (after adding PLP) or apoenzyme activity; the basal EAST activity (before adding PLP) or holoenzyme activity was not associated with the alcohol intake. These results indicate that caution is needed in the interpretation of the specificity of EAST-AC (i.e., the degree to which EAST-AC is unaffected by other factors) as an indicator of vitamin B-6 intake.\r"

Although plasma pyridoxal levels remained normal, the threefold increase in total erythrocyte pyridoxal kinase activity levels did not normalize plasma and erythrocyte pyridoxal-5'-phosphate levels. Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate hydrolysis was not affected by theophylline therapy. Increased pyridoxal oxidation was confirmed by elevated urinary 4-pyridoxic acid excretion after 15 wk of theophylline treatment. Mean erythrocyte alanine aminotransferase activity declined by 70%, and aspartate aminotransferase activity declined by 50%, indicating that decreased availability of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate can have widespread metabolic consequences. We conclude that the effect of theophylline on vitamin B-6 metabolism is not transitory and cannot be overcome by elevated intracellular levels of pyridoxal kinase. However, pyridoxine supplementation (10 mg/d for 1 wk) normalized indices of vitamin B-6 status and reversed the downward trend in both alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activity levels.\r"

Eggshell quality and values for a blood indicator of acid-base balance were reduced by high levels of dietary P or Cl in all of the experiments. Eggshell quality and values for the blood acid-base indicator were further reduced by high dietary levels of the combination of minerals. The adverse effects associated with high levels of the combination were greater than the sum of adverse effects associated with high levels of each mineral. The effects of P and Cl on plasma levels of these minerals were inconsistent and varied among experiments. The use of pair-fed controls revealed that the adverse effects of combined P and Cl on eggshell quality and acid-base balance were independent of their effects on feed and calcium intake. Calcium excretion was increased by consumption of the high P, high Cl diet. The information obtained from these experiments suggests that the adverse effects of high levels of dietary P and/or Cl on eggshell quality may be due, at least in part, to increased Ca excretion. This, in turn, may be mediated by acidemia resulting from the dietary manipulations, although the present data were insufficient to provide a direct link between acidemia and Ca excretion.\r"

The degree of stimulation was similar for both MT1 and MT2, with mRNA levels increasing approximately fourfold for a six- to eightfold increase in intracellular copper levels. In contrast, neither copper uptake nor ceruloplasmin mRNA showed any response to intracellular copper levels. Unlike the situation in the rat, there was no clear evidence for saturation of copper uptake. Incubating cells with increasing amounts of 64Cu resulted in a linear increase in the amount taken up over 2 h. The amount of 64Cu accumulated was the same in control and copper-depleted cells, which suggests that neither ceruloplasmin production nor copper uptake is regulated by intracellular copper levels. However, other possibilities, such as the chelators not being able to deplete the pool(s) responsible for the control of ceruloplasmin production or copper uptake, must also be considered.\r"

At all times of the day, total and free thyroxine concentrations were higher after soy feeding than after casein feeding. On average, total and free thyroxine concentrations were 34 and 26% higher with soy protein feeding than with casein feeding. Our data agree with other reports of protein-dependent changes of thyroid hormones and may explain why different dietary proteins have different effects on serum cholesterol levels in sensitive species.\r"

Spleen weight and total number of splenic cells were significantly lower in the food-restricted group at 8 mo of age. Percentages of T (Thy-1.1+) and B (surface Ig+) cells in the splenic cells were not significantly different between the two groups. The number of direct hemolytic plaque-forming cells per 10(6) spleen cells 4 d following immunization with sheep red blood cells and dinitrophenyl-Ficoll was significantly greater in the 8-mo-old mice in the food-restricted group than in the control group. In the latter group, antibody responses Progressively decreased with age. Mitogen responses to concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide were maintained in the food-restricted group but were depressed in the control group at 8 mo. In addition, though autoantibody to single-stranded DNA increased in the control group with advancing age, there was a steady decrease in the food-restricted group until 8 mo. Serum immunoglobulin (IgA and IgM) concentrations were significantly lower in the food-restricted group than in controls at 8 mo of age. Therefore, our results suggest that when senescence accelerated mice are subjected to food restriction, there may be a modulatory effect on the immune dysfunction associated with advancing age.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effects of energy restriction on the pituitary-ovarian axis and on a hormone responsive gene, the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). Female C3H/SHN F1-hybrid mice, known to display a high incidence of mammary tumors, ate an energy-restricted diet (48 kcal/wk) or a control diet (95 kcal/wk) beginning at the time of weaning. By 67 wk of age, 12 of 32 mice in the control group, but none of the 33 mice in the energy-restricted group, had developed mammary tumors. Six tumor-free mice from each group were studied in detail at 67 wk of age. All six tumor-free control mice, but none of the six energy-restricted mice, showed uterine endometrial hyperplasia at autopsy. Mice subjected to energy restriction did not display an estrous cycle. The average levels of MMTV mRNA in mammary glands and uteri were strongly reduced by energy restriction. MMTV mRNA levels in mammary glands from control mice were two orders of magnitude lower than those in mammary tumors. Energy restriction lowered the percentage of pituitary mammatropes and suppressed proliferation of mammatropes with advancing age. Energy restriction thus appeared to inhibit endometrial hyperplasia and to decrease MMTV production at the mRNA level in the mammary glands and in the uterus. These effects may be a consequence of hormonal changes originating at the pituitary-ovarian axis.\r"

  ".U": "91038376\r", 
  ".W": "The influence of life span-prolonging dietary energy restriction on hepatic expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 and 94 (GRP78 and GRP94) RNA was investigated in female C3B10RF1 mice. Mice were either fed ad libitum or fed diets reduced 20 or 40% in energy but containing approximately equivalent amounts of protein, fats, vitamins and minerals. Aging produced no changes in GRP mRNA. However, GRP78 and GRP94 mRNA levels were reduced approximately 50 and 40%, respectively, by 40% energy restriction. This level of energy restriction produced a 43% reduction in the mean plasma glucose levels of young and old mice. The changes in GRP mRNA expression appear to be specific, because the levels of these RNAs were normalized to the level of polyadenylated RNA, and no changes were detected in the levels of a number of other mRNAs. Although extreme glucose deprivation increases GRP mRNA levels in cultured cell lines, physiologically relevant reductions in blood glucose had the opposite effect in the liver, in vivo. The regulatory pathway responsible for these effects is not known. GRP mRNA levels are elevated by agents that increase the level of malfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, energy restriction may act to reduce malfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatic cells.\r"

Isoenergetic, isonitrogenous diets composed of corn oil or tallow (commercial grade), each at 5 or 34%, were fed to rats for 2 wk, and their preference for diets covarying in carbohydrate and protein was subsequently tested. When compared to either of the corn oil groups or the 5% tallow group, rats previously fed the high tallow diet selected more protein and less carbohydrate. Subsequent experiments testing the effects of 5, 20 or 34% tallow indicated that this preference for protein was induced by exposure to the tallow diets for only 18 h. In addition, the 34% tallow group selected more protein than did rats fed 5 or 20% tallow. Tests of diet selection with 5 or 34% corn oil, tallow or hydrogenated coconut oil indicated that rats fed 34% tallow ate significantly more protein than the 34% corn oil group. Furthermore, animals fed a 34% pure, additive-free tallow diet exhibited a preference for protein. These studies suggest that the type and level of dietary fat interact to influence dietary selection.\r"

DESIGN: Analysis of prospectively collected data from a cohort study. SETTING: Emergency departments of four community and three university hospitals. PATIENTS: 5,673 patients aged greater than or equal to 30 years who presented to the EDs of participating hospitals for evaluation of acute chest pain, including 772 (14%) with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After adjusting for clinical characteristics, no significant difference was found in the sensitivities of admission to the hospital or to the coronary care unit (CCU) between AMI patients with and without prior ECGs available for review. However, non-AMI patients with prior ECGs available for review were more likely to avoid CCU admission than were non-AMI patients without prior ECGs. This improvement in specificity was most marked in the 2,024 patients whose current ED ECGs had changes consistent with ischemia or infarction: when a prior ECG was available, non-AMI patients were more than twice as likely to be discharged (26% vs. 12%) and about 1.5 times as likely to avoid CCU admission (39% vs. 27%) (both p less than 0.0001). Admission rates of AMI patients with and without prior ECGs were similar. CONCLUSION: When the current ECG is consistent with ischemia or infarction, the availability of a prior ECG for comparison to determine whether the ECG changes are old or new improves diagnostic accuracy and triage decisions by reducing the admission of patients without AMI or acute ischemic heart disease (increased specificity) without reducing the admission of patients with these diagnoses (unchanged sensitivity).\r"

PARTICIPANTS: 386 housestaff; 221 responded. INTERVENTION: Survey questionnaire. MAIN RESULTS: 1) Frequency of needlestick: Of 221 respondents, 57 (26%) reported never having had a needlestick, while 164 (74%) reported at least one needlestick injury with a suture or hollow-bore needle. The average frequencies were 0.63 per resident-year among 149 non-surgical residents and 3.8 per resident-year among 72 surgical residents. Among residents in internal medicine, 12 of 78 needlestick injuries (15%) sustained were from patients documented to be HIV-positive. 2) Causes of needlestick: The causes of injury were assessed in detail in a sample of the 157 most recent needlestick injuries. Suturing was the cause in 35 of 61 (57%) surgical residents, while recapping needles was the cause in 36 of 96 (38%) non-surgical residents. Inexperience was not the cause of injury; in 94% of cases the residents felt comfortable performing the procedure, and in 74% of cases the residents had performed the procedure more than 50 times before. 3) Reporting of injury: Only 30 (19%) of 157 injuries were reported to the personnel health service, thus compromising documentation for potential workmen's compensation. CONCLUSIONS: Needlestick injuries are common among medical and surgical housestaff. Efforts should be made to prevent needlestick injuries and to report those that occur.\r"

DESIGN: Decision analysis comparing early surgery (timed at the onset of left ventricular dysfunction) with delayed surgery (timed at the onset of symptoms) using data from the literature and expert opinion for variables in a representative case scenario (40-year-old man with bicuspid aortic valve disease). SETTING: Tertiary care center doing valve replacement surgery. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The early-surgery approach was preferred based on quality-adjusted life years. Sensitivity analysis showed that the result was not affected by the following variables within their derived ranges: rate of symptom development after onset of left ventricular dysfunction for the delayed-surgery approach, perioperative mortality for both approaches, and occurrence of major nonfatal stroke or congestive heart failure for both approaches. Although the decision was sensitive to the yearly postoperative mortality rates, the delayed-surgery operative mortality rate had to be almost as low as the early-surgery rate to change the preference to the delayed-surgery approach. The preference could also change if survival were much more important to the patient in the first five years than after five years or if the patient disliked living on anticoagulants enough to value a year on anticoagulants as worth only 80% of a year not on anticoagulants. CONCLUSION: This decision analysis provides quantitative support for the impression that patients similar to the case scenario do better with surgery timed at the onset of ventricular dysfunction than with surgery delayed until symptoms develop. It thus supports the practice of following these patients noninvasively in order to time surgery.\r"

They were asked to indicate which treatment they preferred and which portion(s) of the curves most influenced their preference. A large majority of both patients and health professionals preferred the treatment that had worse short-term and better long-term survival. Eleven percent of patients and 51% of health professionals identified mid-curve data (points other than the curve end-points) as most influencing their preferences. CONCLUSIONS: A graphic survival curve appears to provide enough information to assess patient preferences between two alternative treatments. Patients appeared to differ from physicians and medical students in their interpretation of the curves.\r"

METHODS: A decision tree and threshold analysis were used to define the thresholds of disease probability at which either testing or treatment should be implemented. The expert testimony of two witnesses that exercise stress testing was the standard of care was compared with the results of the decision analysis.

DESIGN: Prospective, six-month comparison of nurse and attending ratings of houseofficer humanistic behavior. PROCEDURE: Using a six-item, Likert-scale humanistic behavior rating form, nurses and ward attendings evaluated 76 PGY-1, PGY-2, and PGY-3 houseofficers over a six-month period. Nurses and attendings voluntarily evaluated houseofficers on all inpatient units in both university and Veterans Administration teaching hospitals. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Nurse ratings discriminated residents from one another throughout the six months of the study and over all units in both hospitals. Attending physician ratings were only moderately correlated with nurses' and were significantly more lenient. Exploratory analyses of the nursing evaluations revealed that female houseofficers received significantly more favorable evaluations than did men and that ward nurses were significantly more lenient than were critical care nurses. Nurse ratings did not differ by hospital, training year, or month of evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses can provide information about humanistic behavior that will allow program directors to discriminate among different levels of houseofficer behavior. Information from nurses differs from that provided by attending physicians. Nurse ratings are affected by gender and by the type of unit from which they are obtained.\r"

DESIGN: Longitudinal descriptive study. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: 54 PGY-1-3 internal medicine and family practice residents enrolled in three training programs affiliated with Michigan State University's College of Human Medicine. INTERVENTION: Trainees' attitudes towards and knowledge about certain prevention activities were captured by an instrument designed for this study using 127 Likert scales. Counseling skills were assessed with one of two standardized patients. Residents were unaware of the simulation, which occurred in their routinely scheduled ambulatory care setting. Audiotapes of the interactions were rated by blinded, independent raters. Residents had strong positive beliefs about the role of primary care physicians in counseling patients, high levels of knowledge about what the counseling should entail, and high self-assessment about the frequency and quality of their own counseling interventions. Skill levels, however, were at or below a level defined as minimally acceptable. CONCLUSION: Resident physicians' skill levels, as measured in this study, are inadequate to accomplish routine counseling interventions in the primary care setting. These results suggest that more reliance should be placed on direct observation of physicians, ideally in nonreactive settings, for purposes of drawing conclusions about physician performance. Further, these results have implications for the training of students and residents in the area of counseling for prevention.\r"

DESIGN: Survey of residents who had recently completed internal medicine training. PARTICIPANTS: 5,693 respondents who completed residencies in 1987 and 1988 and were registered as first-time takers for the 1988 Certifying Examination in Internal Medicine. This constituted a 76% response rate. MAIN RESULTS: Virtually all residents were aware that routine evaluations were submitted on inpatient rotations, but were more uncertain about the evaluation process in the outpatient setting and the methods used to assess their humanistic qualities. Most residents had undergone a Clinical Evaluation Exercise (CEX); residents' clinical skills were less likely to be evaluated by direct observation of history or physical examination skills. Resident responses were aggregated within training programs to determine the pattern of evaluation across programs. The majority of programs used Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) certification, medical record audit, and the national In-Training Examination to assess most of their residents. Performance-based tests were used selectively by a third or more of the programs. Breast and pelvic examination skills and ability to perform sigmoidoscopy were thought not to be adequately assessed by the majority of residents in almost half of the programs. CONCLUSIONS: While most residents are receiving routine evaluation, including a CEX, increased efforts to educate residents about their evaluation system, to strengthen evaluation in the outpatient setting, and to evaluate certain procedural skills are recommended.\r"

The release of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's guide to clinical preventive services has provided physicians with authoritative prevention recommendations. While most physicians are specialists with little interest or skill in preventive care, primary care providers do accept an obligation to provide comprehensive care, including prevention. This paper examines the ethical basis for the idea of obligation. External pressures, legal, economic, and organizational, are affecting the physician-patient relationship in ways that encourage a contract mode of medical practice and limit physicians' ability to provide preventive care. As a profession, medicine needs to speak for the health needs of the public. As practitioners, physicians need to seek the welfare of their patients.\r"

Only through linkages to progressive health care reform, to primary care, and to the biopsychosocial model can prevention achieve an important place in medical education.\r"

Major reasons physicians do not perform the recommended tests include physician forgetfulness, disagreement with recommendations, lack of time, and patient refusal. Physicians also tend to overestimate their own performance rates. Barriers to screening test performance can be categorized into patient factors, physician factors, test factors, and health care delivery system factors. Interventions, such as computerized reminder systems, physician audits with feedback, and patient education and reminders, can be effective in promoting performance of such screening. Interventions that target both physician and patient may be particularly effective.\r"

The concentration of resources on those most in need is efficient, the widening of physicians' responsibility is welcome, and the influence on the recipients diffuses into the community. The Task Force report, however, fails to stress the problems and the limitations of this approach. The adverse effects of \"labeling\" can be serious. They need to be measured and taken into account, and there should be no screening without counseling and long-term care; the latter cannot be guaranteed unless there is a comprehensive general practitioner system. Screening readily generates overmedication, particularly since many physicians lack the skills, the inclination, or the staff to provide expert and continuing health advice. Concern for high-risk individuals should be only one part of a much wider preventive strategy. This is illustrated by the close correlations between the prevalence of high-risk status and the population mean value (0.85 for hypertension vs. mean blood pressure, 0.97 for excess use of alcohol vs. population mean intake). The medical approach, important though it is, must not distract attention from the more fundamental population strategy of prevention.\r"

In contradistinction to those issued by some other national organizations, screening for breast cancer using mammography at ages 40-49 is not recommended. It is concluded that the scientific evidence is insufficient at present to recommend mammography screening for women aged 40-49. The recommendations of the task force are: all women over age 40 should receive an annual breast examination; all women should have mammography every one or two years beginning at age 50 and concluding at approximately age 75 unless disease has been detected; and it may be prudent to begin mammography at an earlier age for women at high risk of breast cancer. These recommendations are appropriate in light of the available evidence; though at present there is no evidence that clinical examination of the breasts at any age reduces breast cancer mortality; the upper age beyond which breast cancer screening no longer has a significant effect in reducing breast cancer mortality is unknown; and there is no evidence that women at high risk for breast cancer benefit to a different degree from screening than women not at high risk.\r"

  ".W": "Three currently used screening methods are aimed at detecting colorectal cancer when it is asymptomatic and curable, and at detecting polyps so that they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. Digital rectal examinations are relatively cheap and easy but can detect only a small fraction of large-bowel cancers. Sigmoidoscopy is more sensitive, but its low acceptability to patients has been only partially mitigated by the introduction of the 35-cm flexible instrument. Fecal occult blood testing has limited sensitivity because blood from cancers and polyps is neither continuously shed nor uniformly distributed in feces; specificity and positive predictive value are also low because of other sources of blood in the stool. Prudent judgment suggests that all of these screening tests may prevent death from colorectal cancer in some patients. However, none has been proven effective in general use by well-controlled studies. Case-control studies can provide timely and valuable new evidence in this regard; the authors' investigations in progress are described. The current lack of strong evidence in support of these screening tests should not be interpreted as evidence against their use.\r"

Several studies have found that these screening questionnaires can increase detection rates, but no important impact on patient outcomes has been demonstrated. This review article outlines several reasons why it has been difficult to discern improvement in patient outcomes: inadequate study design, insufficient physician education, interdependence of psychiatric and medical conditions, and vague treatment guidelines. Practical use of the current psychiatric screening questionnaires and key areas for further investigation are considered.\r"

Women who are found by screening not to be immune to rubella can be safely vaccinated prior to pregnancy; those found to be at risk of having children with genetic disorders such as Tay-Sachs disease or thalassemia have the option of avoiding the conception of affected offspring. Screening during pregnancy permits the primary prevention of Rh disease and its sequelae when it results in the prophylactic administration of Rh-immune globulin to unsensitized Rh-negative women. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening identifies pregnant women who are at increased risk of carrying fetuses with neural tube defects or Down's syndrome, giving them the option of avoiding the birth of affected fetuses through abortion. Recombinant DNA technology will permit screening for many more genetic disorders as the disease-related genes and mutations are identified. For many of these disorders, the ability to predict the risk of disease will antedate preventive and therapeutic interventions by many years. During this lag phase, issues concerning the validity of the tests, the severity of the conditions for which screening is offered, the safety of the interventions, and the autonomy of the pregnant women in deciding to be screened are important.\r"

Labeling an individual with a false-positive test, or with a true-positive test for which there is no evidence that intervention makes a difference, e.g., intervention on an 80-year-old asymptomatic woman with hypercholesterolemia, can have a markedly negative impact on the quality of life. Interpreting statistical abnormalities out of clinical context, e.g., lending importance to a multiphasic blood screen showing \"high\" alkaline phosphatase in a teenager, leads to unnecessary costs and anxiety. The cost of screening programs that may not have been shown to do more good than harm is already having an impact on the resources available to diagnose and treatment symptomatic persons. Premature implementation of unproved screening programs will continue to decrease physician and public confidence in prevention.\r"

In secondary prevention among those with a history of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or transient cerebral ischemia, or unstable angina pectoris, 25 randomized trials demonstrated significant reductions from aspirin of 25% for the occurrence of an \"important vascular event\" (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or vascular death), 32% for nonfatal MI, 27% for nonfatal stroke, and 15% for vascular mortality. Among those evolving an MI, the Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2) showed a significant reduction of 23% in five-week vascular mortality among those started on a one-month regimen of daily aspirin within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of suspected MI. Aspirin also significantly reduced reinfarction, nonfatal stroke, and important vascular events. Finally, in primary prevention, the US Physicians' Health Study (PHS) showed a significant 44% reduction in the occurrence of a first MI among apparently healthy male physicians; numbers of strokes and vascular deaths were insufficient to permit conclusions for these endpoints. Thus, aspirin is of clear benefit in reducing MI, stroke, and vascular death in secondary prevention and among those evolving an MI. It is also beneficial in the primary prevention of MI among men over 40, but data concerning its effects on stroke and vascular death remain inconclusive.\r"

However, much can be done to reduce the number and severity of injuries, and the practicing physician has an important role to play in this process. This report outlines the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force report recommendations for prevention strategies to reduce injuries and then seeks to define a broader role for the physician in prevention injuries that extends beyond the confines of office-based practice. While screening and counseling have proven effectiveness in certain situations, interventions that are passive or automatic in action, such as air bags, have proven to be more effective long-term solutions to reduce both the number and the severity of injuries. The author outlines and provides examples of seven areas where physicians can have a major impact either directly or through implementing effective injury-control strategies. These are: treatment, education, screening, hazard identification, research, advocacy, and policy making. Using all of these approaches, physicians can play a truly effective role in reducing the burden of injuries for their patients.\r"

  ".W": "Nicotine meets all critical criteria for an addictive drug. Furthermore, there is no evidence that there would be widespread compulsive use of tobacco without nicotine. These findings have led to consideration of the cigarette as a contaminated vehicle for an addictive drug (nicotine). Nevertheless, nicotine itself may also be used therapeutically to reduce exposure to carcinogens and other tobacco toxins. Nicotine replacement is a useful adjunct in treating tobacco dependence. For example, nicotine replacement in the form of a polacrilex resin (chewing gum) can alleviate physically based signs and symptoms of tobacco abstinence. The fact that this form of nicotine replacement is not attractive to non-users of tobacco has opened the door to the use of nicotine in a therapeutic modality, permitting hope of eliminating tobacco dependence.\r"

The appearance of AIDS, however, has made competency in this area of interviewing essential for all primary care physicians. The teaching of sexual history taking presents a challenge to educators, since it involves all three educational domains--cognitive, affective, and skills. The authors have developed an approach to teaching sexual history taking to providers in small groups utilizing videotapes that model the content and sequence of questions and confront learners about the fears and the emotional concerns they may have in obtaining these data.\r"

  ".W": "Adolescent childbearing has adverse sequelae that are intensified when the onset of sexual activity takes place at a particularly early age. A relationship between the onset of sexual activity and the age of maturation has been demonstrated; as the mean age of menarche has become younger, a greater discontinuity has been created between physical development on the one hand and cognitive and emotional development on the other. Initiatives to prevent early sexual initiation and unintended pregnancy must be designed in that context and with an appreciation of normative social pressures. This report reviews research on adolescent development and sexual behavior, including the relationship between maturation and the onset of sexual activity, the timing of pregnancy risk, clinic utilization and reasons for delay in clinic attendance, and clusters of high-risk behaviors. It discusses the role of clinical interventions, suggesting ways in which those who treat adolescents can assist them in acquiring and maintaining protective behaviors.\r"

  ".W": "A prevention program is cost-effective if it yields more health benefits than do alternative uses of health care resources. Some prevention programs meet this standard: either they actually save more health care resources than they utilize, or their net costs per healthy year of life gained are lower than those of alternatives such as curative or palliative medicine. Other prevention programs, however, are less cost-effective than are medical treatments for the same disease. One lesson for public policy is that generalizations about the cost-effectiveness of \"prevention\" are unwise. Another lesson is that prevention programs should not be subjected to a higher standard than other health programs: they should not be expected to save money, but they should be expected to yield improved health at a reasonable price.\r"
