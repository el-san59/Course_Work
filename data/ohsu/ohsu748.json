One hundred twenty C3H/HE female mice were injected in the hind limb with 7.5 X 10(4) MBT-2 tumor cells. When palpable tumors developed in all animals, therapy was initiated. Animals were randomized into a control group and nine treatment groups as follows: cisplatin (DDP), MTX32 mg, MTX50 mg, MTX80 mg, DDP + MTX32, MTX50 + Leucovorin, MTX80 + Leucovorin, DDP + MTX50 + Leucovorin, DDP + MTX80 + Leucovorin. The combination of MTX50 mg with Leucovorin + DDP and DDP alone were the two most effective regimens in controlling tumor growth and prolonging survival. No statistically significant difference was observed between the group treated by high-dose MTX alone and those treated by low-dose MTX.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an extremely bright lesion on T2 weighted image, which is virtually pathognomonic. MRI is the most sensitive modality for the detection of an extra-adrenal or unsuspected multiple pheochromocytoma. This should obviate the need for routine abdominal exploration in the evaluation and treatment of pheochromocytoma. Therefore we strongly recommend magnetic resonance imaging in the management of adrenal masses in general and pheochromocytomas in particular.\r"

Tritiated dexamethasone was added to both untreated and charcoal-treated pooled normal serum and to pooled uremic serum to produce concentrations similar to those attained therapeutically (10-1000 ng/mL). Protein binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees C. Dexamethasone serum binding was linear over the entire range of concentrations for each set of pooled serum. The mean (+/- SD) percent bound (mean +/- SD) for dexamethasone was similar for untreated (75.1 +/- 3.6 percent) and charcoal-treated (77.3 +/- 3.5 percent) normal serum. Dexamethasone binding (69.2 +/- 1.8 percent, p less than 0.05) and serum albumin concentrations (39.9 vs. 55.1 mmol/L) were significantly less in uremic vs. normal serum, respectively. These results suggest that (1) the binding of dexamethasone is linear and occurs primarily to albumin, with little or no binding to corticosteroid-binding globulin; (2) endogenous cortisol does not compete with dexamethasone for protein binding sites; and (3) steroid pharmacokinetics may be altered in uremic patients due to the 24 percent higher free fraction of dexamethasone in this population.\r"

All other factors, including laboratory data, dietary intake, activity level, and concurrent use of other medications, were stable and noncontributory. This patient may have been at increased risk for this interaction secondary to his age and history of alcohol abuse. The mechanism of the interaction is probably inhibition of glipizide metabolism rather than protein-binding displacement.

There was considerable individual variation in AUC with one subject demonstrating an increase of 35 percent and one subject demonstrating a decrease of 18 percent. There was a trend toward aluminum hydroxide delaying tmax with only one subject experiencing an earlier tmax with the coadministration of aluminum hydroxide.

Data on patients considered for inclusion in the study were obtained from the files of the aminoglycoside monitoring services at Saskatoon University Hospital and Regina General Hospital. Both services use a computer program that calculates pharmacokinetic parameters using the Sawchuk-Zaske method. Children between the ages of 1 and 16 years with normal renal function from whom serum concentration had been obtained were included in the study. Exclusion criteria included abnormal or unstable renal function, cystic fibrosis, and pregnancy. The mean age of the pediatric group was 8.65 +/- 5.37 years. Average values for Vd and half-life were 0.34 L/kg and 2.3 h, respectively. No strong correlation was found between the Vd (L/kg) and age. The patients were subdivided into three age groups: 1-4.9 years, 5-9.9 years, and 10-16 years. Group 1 (1-4.9 years) had a larger Vd than the other groups and the Vd of all three groups were significantly different from the estimated Vd of 0.20 L/kg for adult patients. A \"normal\" pediatric value for the Vd of aminoglycosides could not be determined; however, the Vd in children is significantly larger than the Vd in adults and dosage regimens should be adjusted accordingly.\r"

Problems may occur in patients receiving drugs with a narrow therapeutic index when combined with cimetidine. Contrasting reports have been published on the potential interaction between digoxin and cimetidine. This study focuses on cimetidine's effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of chronic digoxin usage. Six hospitalized patients with stable congestive heart failure received their usual maintenance dose of digoxin 0.125-0.25 mg/d po. After confirming steady-state digoxin concentrations, cimetidine 300 mg po q6h was administered. Two patients were dropped from the study. Analysis of digoxin serum concentrations, area under the curve, and the rate of elimination suggested no significant differences in digoxin parameters when combined with cimetidine.\r"

The service was provided to five family practice physicians. Pharmacists identified hypertensive patients prior to their regularly scheduled office visits from April through June 1986. Patient's medical records and computerized drug files were reviewed, and written recommendations for drug therapy changes were placed in patients' medical record by the pharmacists. When appropriate, pharmacists alerted prescribers to lower cost alternatives. A matched control group of physicians was selected. Hypertensive patients were identified retrospectively in the control group. We found that the cost of antihypertensive drug therapy was significantly higher for study physicians' patients when compared with control physicians' patients in the period prior to implementing the service. The difference between the two groups was not significant after six months. Clinical pharmacist intervention decreased the average cost of antihypertensive treatment from 33.4 to 27.2 cents per day.\r"

The statistical power of a study could be spuriously increased or decreased, sample size could be altered dramatically, and the uniqueness of the individual unit under study (e.g., a patient) could be lost and substituted by average values of characteristics depending on which unit of study is selected. The 1985 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey of the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics was used to illustrate research methodologies that would deflate spuriously high results due to clustered sampling. Using the individual patient as the study unit, correction factors ranging from 1.99 to 35.40 were calculated in order to deflate exaggerated t-tests, chi-square, and F values of predictor variables. The effect of clustering was more marked on (1) continuous rather than binary outcome variables, as the former provide a richer environment to form clusters; and (2) on outcome variables relating to the practice-related or personal style of physicians. Using the physician (who represented a cluster of patients) as the unit of study, it was realized that correction factors were relevant to physician-specific predictors but not patient-specific predictors. Using design effect correction factors developed from a simple univariate analysis of variance, pharmacoepidemiologists can analyze accurately the currently available large survey databases of clustered samples.\r"

Regional asynergy is one of the first signs of myocardial ischemia and can be detected with 2-dimensional echocardiography (2-DE). This study determines the value of 2-DE in the emergency room for immediate detection of myocardial ischemia causing acute chest pain at the time the electrocardiogram was nondiagnostic. Forty-three patients (32 men and 11 women) with a normal or nondiagnostic electrocardiogram during acute chest pain were studied with 2-DE. Only patients without a previous myocardial infarction and without known coronary artery disease (CAD) were studied. The entire left ventricular wall was examined for presence of regional asynergy. Coronary angiography was performed within 3 weeks. Cardiac enzyme levels were measured serially to establish or rule out an acute myocardial infarction. Sensitivity of 2-DE for detection of myocardial ischemia was 88% (22 of 25), specificity 78% (14 of 18), negative predictive accuracy 82% (14 of 17) and positive predictive accuracy 85% (22 of 26). Sensitivity of 2-DE for detection of acute myocardial infarction was 92% (12 of 13), specificity 53% (16 of 30) and negative predictive accuracy 94% (16 of 17). Thus, 2-DE during pain and a nondiagnostic electrocardiogram can readily identify patients with CAD in the emergency room, and it can accurately rule out an acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Myocardial infarction size was measured by resting thallium-201 tomography. Peak early filling rate (in end-diastolic volumes/s) was measured by gated blood pool scintigraphy. Doppler measures of mitral inflow were peak early (E) and atrial (A) filling velocities, slopes of E and A, percent E and A filling, E/A ratio and diastolic filling period. In univariate analyses, there was a significant inverse correlation between infarction size and the peak early filling rate (r = -0.59, p less than 0.001), and this remained significant (r = -0.63, p less than 0.0001) in an analysis that included 2 other determinants of the filling rate, age and diastolic filling period.

Angioplasty was successful in 41 of 48 (85%) vein grafts and 24 of 24 (100%) arteries (difference not significant) at 5.1 +/- 4.0 hours from the onset of symptoms (79% treated less than 6 hours). There were no urgent bypass operations, strokes or transfusions. In-hospital survival was 90% (nonshock 95% vs shock 64%, p less than 0.01). Symptomatic acute reclosure occurred in 1 patient. Predischarge coronary arteriography in 34 patients demonstrated continued vessel patency in 32 infarct vessels (94%), although 5 of these vessels were redilated for restenoses. Predischarge paired ventriculography in 26 patients showed an increase in ejection fraction from 44 +/- 16% to 51 +/- 18% (p less than 0.01). One- and 3-year actuarial survival was 89 and 87%. Thus, prior coronary surgery should not preclude reperfusion therapy by direct angioplasty, which can be accomplished with low procedural risk, improvements in ventricular function and excellent in-hospital and late survival.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the presence or absence of angina during a thallium stress test positive for ischemia was independently predictive of an adverse outcome. Two hundred thirty-four consecutive patients with ischemia on a thallium stress test were identified. Ischemia was defined as the presence of defect(s) on the immediate postexercise scans not in the distribution of prior infarctions that redistributed on 4-hour scans. During the test 129 patients had angina, defined as characteristic neck, jaw, arm, back or chest discomfort, while the remaining 105 patients had no angina. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 8.2 years (mean 5.2 +/- 2.1) and was successfully obtained in 156 patients. Eighty-two of the 156 patients had angina (group A) and 74 had silent ischemia (group S). Group A patients were significantly older (62 +/- 8 vs 59 +/- 8 years, p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of sex, history of prior infarction or presence of left main/3-vessel disease. A larger percentage of patients in group A were receiving beta blockers (60 vs 41%, p less than 0.05) and nitrates (52 vs 36%, 0.05 less than p less than 0.10). There was a large number of cardiac events (myocardial infarction, revascularization and death) in both groups (37 of 82 [45%] in group A; 28 of 72 [38%] in group S) but no statistically significant difference between the groups. Similarly, life-table analysis revealed no difference in mortality between the 2 groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "One hundred ten patients with asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) were evaluated prospectively to assess the value of electrophysiologic testing. This testing consisted of up to 3 extrastimuli delivered during 3 drive cycle lengths from 2 right ventricular sites. A positive study was defined as monomorphic VT lasting 30 seconds or requiring cardioversion. Patients with a positive study were treated, and serial drug testing was done. An event during follow-up was sustained VT or cardiac arrest. The mean follow-up was 15 months. Of 57 patients with an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40%, 6 had a positive electrophysiologic test with 1 event and 51 had a negative test with 1 event. Twenty-eight patients had an ejection fraction less than 40% and coronary artery disease: 14 had a positive test with 1 event, and 14 had a negative test with 3 events. Twenty-five patients had an ejection fraction less than 40% and no coronary artery disease: 1 had a positive test with no events, and 24 had a negative test with 8 events. Only ejection fraction and congestive heart failure class were found to be independent predictors of outcome. Patients with an ejection fraction greater than 40% had low inducibility (11%), had few events (3.5%) and did not require electrophysiologic testing. In patients with an ejection fraction less than 40% and coronary artery disease, inducibility was high (50%) and a negative study was of no value. Patients with an ejection fraction less than 40% and no coronary artery disease had low inducibility (4%), had frequent events (33%) and did not benefit from electrophysiologic testing.\r"

  ".W": "A large population of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) patients was analyzed to determine whether age of patients, presence of conduction disturbances and mode of permanent pacing are related to the occurrence of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, cerebral embolism and cardiac mortality. Three hundred thirty-nine patients permanently paced (135 AAI, 79 DDD, 125 VVI) because of SSS were followed for a mean period of 5 years (range 2 to 10). Patients were divided into 4 groups according to age (less than 70 or greater than 70 years) and the presence or absence of an associated conduction disturbance. Sixty-eight percent of VVI, 55% of AAI and 40.5% of DDD patients were greater than 70 years of age. In the VVI and DDD groups a conduction disturbance was present in 67 of 204 (33%) patients; conduction disturbances were more common in patients greater than 70 years old (46 of 111, 41%) than in those less than 70 years old (21 of 93,22%). The Wenckebach threshold (greater than 140 beats/min) remained unchanged during the follow-up period in 82% of AAI patients. In 9% of these patients, the Wenckebach threshold showed some degree of deterioration, but only in 2 patients was it less than 100 beats/min (1.5%). Spontaneous second-degree atrioventricular block was observed in 7 patients (5%); it disappeared in 6 of these patients when drug therapy was discontinued.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-three patients with severe, stable, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) (New York Heart Association class III to IV) participated. Both drugs produced an increase in cardiac index, brought about by increased stroke volume index and heart rate, and systemic vasodilatation. The relative contribution of these mechanisms differed, dopexamine proving the more potent vasodilator. The effects of dopexamine were maintained without variation during the 48-hr infusion, apart from a reduction in the increase in heart rate. The effects of dobutamine, while remaining above control at most time-points during the 48-hr infusion, attenuated toward control values. Dopexamine also appeared to promote increased urine output and creatinine clearance during the 48-hr infusion. Both drugs were well tolerated. Dopexamine elicited larger peak hemodynamic effects at dosages that had equivalent effects on cardiac output, and favorable renal responses, and demonstrated no long-term attenuation of effect.\r"

To evaluate a possible loss of myocardial carnitine in less severe stages of CHF, total myocardial carnitine levels were compared in right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies from 28 patients with mild, moderate and severe dilated cardiomyopathy, 8 patients with CHF of different origin and 13 normal control subjects. If possible, free myocardial carnitine and free and total plasma carnitine were also determined. For the first time, myocardial carnitine levels have been measured in endomyocardial biopsies from 13 normal human hearts (control values: 9.9 +/- 0.8 nmol/mg noncollagen protein). In comparison with these control values, total myocardial carnitine was significantly reduced in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (6.1 +/- 0.5 nmol/mg noncollagen protein, p less than 0.0001), and CHF of other origins (6.6 +/- 1.1 nmol/mg noncollagen protein, p less than 0.02). Free myocardial carnitine concentrations in dilated cardiomyopathy (4.6 +/- 0.4 nmol/mg noncollagen protein) and CHF of different origin (4.4 +/- 0.5 nmol/mg noncollagen protein) were also significantly different from control values (control values: 9.7 +/- 0.7 nmol/mg noncollagen protein, p less than 0.0001 and p less than 0.005 for both groups). The loss of free and total myocardial carnitine was comparable in dilated cardiomyopathy and CHF due to other diseases. In contrast, plasma free and total carnitine levels in the CHF patients were significantly elevated (67 +/- 5.5 mumol/liter, control values 41 +/- 3.7 mumol/liter, p less than 0.005). Alterations in myocardial carnitine metabolism represent nonspecific biochemical markers in CHF with yet unknown consequences for myocardial function.\r"

(1) Significant transvalvular pressure gradients appear only if the orifice is severely narrowed. (2) The magnitude of this gradient is highly flow dependent. (3) At critical narrowings, minute alterations in orifice size may induce most significant changes in the transvalvular gradient. (4) In low flow states significant gradients appear only if the stenosis is extreme. In patients with aortic stenosis, especially those with failing hearts and low cardiac output, the pressure gradient may be effectively decreased by minimal dilatation of the aortic orifice. These patients, however, remain in jeopardy because recurrent narrowing may cause a gradient incompatible with life.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the \"adequacy\" of basal coronary flow in ventricular hypertrophy, the relation between proximal coronary artery dimensions and regional ventricular mass in aortic valve stenosis (AS) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) was evaluated. Coronary artery size was determined by quantitative coronary arteriography while global/regional ventricular mass was calculated using computer-processed biplane 2-dimensional echocardiography. In comparison to 18 \"normal\" subjects, left anterior descending coronary dimensions were significantly larger in those with hypertrophy (normal 3.32 +/- 0.54, AS 3.82 +/- 0.71, HC 4.72 +/- 0.81 mm, p less than 0.05), with progressive increases in left anterior descending/circumflex coronary diameter ratios (normal 1.04 +/- 0.14, AS 1.18 +/- 0.19, HC 1.25 +/- 0.31, p less than 0.01). Compared to the AS group, indexed anteroseptal mass was greater in the HC subjects (AS 40.9 +/- 8.9 vs HC 72.1 +/- 21 g/m2, p less than 0.001). Both septal width/left anterior descending coronary diameter ratios (AS 3.61 +/- 1.06 vs HC 4.85 +/- 1.17 mm/mm, p less than 0.05) and indexed anteroseptal mass/left anterior descending coronary diameter ratios (AS 11.2 +/- 3.0 vs HC 15.6 +/- 3.4 g/m2/mm, p less than 0.01) were greater in HC subjects. Increased coronary dimensions were observed in both AS and HC, with the greatest changes noted within the left anterior descending distribution in HC, but when analyzed with respect to regional ventricular mass, these subjects demonstrated relative \"inadequate\" enlargement in coronary artery diameters. Underdeveloped epicardial coronary arteries may contribute to anteroseptal myocardial ischemia, with resultant angina pectoris, increased ventricular ectopic activity and sudden death in HC.\r"

Before and after systolic outflow gradients were recorded in 784 valvuloplasties, and the gradient decreased from 71 +/- 33 to 28 +/- 21 mm Hg. The sites of residual obstructions could be ascertained in 196 patients. In these, the total systolic outflow gradients decreased from 85 +/- 41 mm Hg to 33 +/- 27 mm Hg. Of this total residual gradient, 16 +/- 15 mm Hg was transvalvar and 18 +/- 24 mm Hg was infundibular. The degree to which infundibular obstruction subsequently resolved was not determined in this study. The procedure was less effective in reducing outflow gradients in patients with dysplastic valves with or without Noonan's syndrome. There were 5 major complications (0.6%), including 2 deaths (0.2%), a cardiac perforation with tamponade (0.1%) and 2 tricuspid insufficiencies (0.2%). There were 11 minor complications (1.3%) and 21 incidents (2.6%). The incidence of major complications, minor complications and incidents was inversely related to age; it was substantially higher in infants and, in particular, neonates. Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty is a safe and effective method of lowering pulmonary outflow gradients in infants, children and adults. Small transvalvar and varied infundibular gradients commonly are present at the end of the procedure. Assessing the full effect of the procedure requires intermediate-term follow-up and assessing the duration of relief requires long-term follow-up.\r"

Valvuloplasty was successful in 192 of 204 children, reducing the peak systolic left ventricular ejection gradient from 77 +/- 2 to 30 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.001. The same degree of aortic stenosis gradients reduction was noted in both the 38 children under 1 year of age and in the 166 children over 1 year of age. Significant complications included death, aortic regurgitation and femoral artery thrombosis or damage. The incidence of these complications correlated with the age of the child, the ratio of valvuloplasty balloon size/anulus size, or both. The data suggest that percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty provides effective acute relief of valvar aortic stenosis in both infants and children. However, long-term follow-up data are necessary before balloon valvuloplasty can be established as a treatment of choice for congenital valvar aortic stenosis.\r"

Among 129 patients studied at necropsy, an average of 2.7 of the 4 arteries were narrowed greater than 75% in cross-sectional area at some point; in control subjects, narrowing was seen in an average of 0.7 arteries. Patients with unstable angina pectoris had a greater incidence of narrowing (3.2 arteries) than did patients with sudden coronary death (2.8), acute myocardial infarction (MI) (2.7) or healed MI (2.3). Each of the 4 major arteries was divided into segments 5 mm in length, and histologic sections were prepared and stained by the Movat method. A total of 6,461 segments were analyzed from the 129 patients and 1,849 from the 40 controls. In the 129 patients, 35% of the 5-mm segments were narrowed 75 to 100% in cross-sectional area (compared with 3% in control subjects). The group with unstable angina had the highest percentage (48%) of severely narrowed segments compared with the groups with sudden coronary death (36%), acute (34%) and healed MI (31%). Only 8% of the 6,461 segments were narrowed less than or equal to 25% in cross-sectional area, and virtually none of the 6,461 segments was normal; thus, 92% of the coronary segments were narrowed greater than 25% in cross-sectional area by atherosclerotic plaque alone. Among patients with fatal coronary artery disease studied at necropsy, therefore, the atherosclerotic process is severe and diffuse in the major epicardial coronary arteries.\r"

Partial gene duplication has also been recognized in a few cases. We have conducted a survey for duplication in 72 unrelated nondeletion patients, analyzed by Southern blot hybridization with clones representing the entire DMD cDNA. With careful quantitative analysis of hybridization band intensity, 10 cases were found to carry a duplication of part of the gene, a frequency of 14% for nondeletion cases (10/72), or 6% for all cases (10/181). The extent of these duplications has been characterized according to the published exon-containing HindIII fragment map, and in six of the 10 duplications a novel restriction fragment that spanned the duplication junction was detected. The resulting translational reading frame of mRNA has been predicted for nine duplications. A shift of the reading frame was predicted in four of the six DMD cases and in one of the two intermediate cases, while the reading frame remained uninterrupted in both BMD cases. RFLP and quantitative Southern blot analyses revealed a grandpaternal origin of duplication in four families and grandmaternal origin in one family. In all five families, the duplication was found to originate from a single X chromosome. Unequal sister-chromatid exchange is proposed to be the mechanism for the formation of these duplications.\r"

Using published pedigrees that include DNA polymorphism (RFLP) data, we establish that the states of the fragile-X mutation termed \"imprinted\" and \"nonimprinted\" usually can be distinguished by the level of cytogenetic expression of the fragile-X chromosome. This information is then used to assess the state of the fragile-X allele in carrier progeny of individual women who inherited a nonimprinted fragile-X chromosome. From this assessment, an estimate is made of the frequency, in individual women, of primary oocytes with an imprinted fragile-X chromosome. The results of this analysis provide additional support for the specific model in which chromosome imprinting occurs in a female in, on average, half of her primary oocytes. This is the expected frequency if X-chromosome inactivation is the initial step in the imprinting of the mutant fragile-X allele. Moreover, this analysis suggests a biological explanation for peculiarities of fragile-X inheritance described by others as \"clustering\" and the \"Sherman paradox.\" We interpret these peculiarities as consequences of a very small number of oogonial progenitor cells. Two progenitor cells for oogonia is the best integer estimate of the number of such cells at the time of the initial event that leads to chromosome imprinting.\r"

  ".W": "Arylsulfatase C is a microsomal membrane-bound enzyme previously thought to be the same as steroid sulfatase, the only X-linked enzyme known to escape from X inactivation in man. We had shown that arylsulfatase C actually consists of two biochemically distinct isozymes, s and f. Only the s form has steroid sulfatase activity. The f and s forms were thought to be related through posttranslational or posttranscriptional modification of the same gene product. In part consistent with this hypothesis, we now report that in a panel of 28 rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, expression of both s and f was concordant only with the human X chromosome, thus showing that the f form is also X linked. In three separate somatic hybrids containing human X chromosomes in an inactive state, the f form was still expressed. Thus, similar to the s form, the f form also escapes from X inactivation. However, contrary to expectations, the s and f forms were not related by posttranslational modification of the same gene product. A full-length cDNA for the s form failed to hybridize to transcripts produced from an f-expressing cell line, showing that there is little sequence identity between the two. They are also not related by differential splicing of a common primary transcript, since fibroblasts from some patients with steroid sulfatase deficiency due to gene deletion of the s form continue to express the f form. Therefore, although the f and s isozymes of arylsulfatase C are X linked and escape from X inactivation, they are products from separate genes, thus providing a unique isoenzyme system to study possible gene duplication and regulation in the part of the human X chromosome that escapes inactivation.\r"

In these individuals, the number of somatic cells (fibroblasts or red cells) with an active FRA-X chromosome could be assessed through the G6PD phenotype at the single-cell level. The data reported indicate a significant inverse correlation between the IQ level (as measured by the Wechsler-Bellevue test) and the percentage of fibroblast cells with an FRA-X active chromosome. In contrast, no significant correlation was found when the IQ level and red cell data were compared, thus suggesting the occurrence of somatic selection against hematopoietic stem cells with an active FRA-X chromosome.\r"

  ".U": "90196006\r", 
  ".W": "Laird has suggested that the mutation responsible for the fragile X (FraX) syndrome interferes with the process of X chromosome reactivation in oocytes, thus blocking the transcription of loci at or neighboring the fragile site (Xq27.3) and producing the clinical FraX phenotype; he has also suggested that the transcriptional block might result from inappropriate DNA methylation. We have explored the latter possibility by examining the methylation status of several genes flanking the fragile site in eight FraX males from seven unrelated families. These genes (HPRT, G6PD, P3, and GdX), contain 5' clusters of CpG dinucleotides which are differentially methylated in transcriptionally active and inactive loci. Using the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme, HpaII, we observed no differences between FraX and normal males in the methylation either of CpG islands in any of these genes or in nonclustered CpGs within the body of the HPRT gene. The same was true for the CpG cluster in intron 22 of the clotting factor VIII gene. In each gene, the island is methylated on the inactive X chromosome and not on the active one, but in no case were these islands methylated in FraX males. The four anonymous loci (DXS98, DXS304, DXS52, and DXS15) that are closely linked to the FraX locus (the closest is within 5 centimorgans) are not differentially methylated on active and inactive X, nor are they unusually methylated in FraX males. Therefore, our observations provide no evidence that DNA methylation in the vicinity of the FraX locus has a role in producing the clinical phenotype of the FraX syndrome.\r"

We and others have found that several of these repeats have variable lengths in different individuals, with allelic fragments varying in size by multiples of 2 bp. These \"microsatellite\" variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) may be scored by PCR, using unique flanking primers to amplify the repeat-containing regions and resolving the products on DNA sequencing gels. Since few VNTRs have been found on the X chromosome, we screened a flow-sorted X chromosome-specific genomic library for microsatellites. Approximately 25% of the phage clones hybridized to a poly (dT-dG).poly(dA-dC) probe. Of seven X-linked microsatellites present in positive phages, five are polymorphic and three have both eight or more alleles and heterozygosities exceeding 75%. Using PCR to amplify genomic DNAs from hybrid cell panels, we confirmed the X localization of these VNTRs and regionally mapped four of them. The fifth VNTR was regionally mapped by virtue of its tight linkage to DXS87 in Centre du Polymorphisme Humain families. We conclude that whatever factors limit the occurrence of \"classical\" VNTRs and RFLPs on the X chromosome do not appear to operate in the case of microsatellite VNTRs.\r"

These and other markers confirm that carboxypeptidase lies distal to the locus for cystic fibrosis, at a distance of approximately 12 centimorgans. The regions containing identity to the rat gene were sequenced and shown to be 82% identical to exons 9 and 10 of the rat gene. The presence of a codon for isoleucine at the residues corresponding to codon 255 of rat CPA1 cDNA strongly suggests that the A form of human carboxypeptidase has been isolated.\r"

  ".W": "We have performed linkage analysis in a large French-Acadian kindred segregating one form of autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTD) (type IA) using 17 polymorphic DNA markers spanning human chromosome 17 and demonstrate linkage to several markers in the pericentromeric region, including DNA probes pA10-41, EW301, S12-30, pTH17.19, c11-2B, and p11-2c11.5. Linkage of markers pA10-41 and EW301 to CMTD type IA has been reported elsewhere. Four new markers, 1516, 1517, 1541, and LL101, which map to chromosome 17 have been identified. The marker 1516 appears to be closely linked to the CMTD locus on chromosome 17 as demonstrated by a maximum lod score of 3.42 at theta (recombination fraction) = 0. This marker has been mapped to 17p11.2 using a somatic cell hybrid constructed from a patient with Smith-Magenis syndrome [46,XY, del(17)(p11.2p11.2)]. A lod score of 6.16 has been obtained by multipoint linkage analysis with 1516 and two markers from 17q11.2, pTH17.19, and c11-2B. The markers 1517 and 1541 have been mapped to 17p12-17q11.2 and demonstrate maximum lod scores of 2.35 and 0.63 at recombination values of .1 and .2, respectively. The marker LL101 has been mapped to 17p13.105-17p13.100 and demonstrates a maximum lod score of 1.56 at a recombination value of .1. Our study confirms the localization of CMTD type IA to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17.\r"

  ".W": "alpha 1-Antitrypsin (alpha 1AT), the major serum inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, is a highly polymorphic protein associated with isoelectric focusing (IEF) patterns typical for each variant. alpha 1AT Vmunich, a previously unreported normal alpha 1AT variant, has a unique IEF banding pattern in which the 7 and 8 alpha 1AT protein bands focus with the normal M-type 7 and 8 bands, despite the fact that the major fraction of the Vmunich protein focuses in the \"V\" region of the IEF gel. To characterize the molecular basis of this variant and its unique IEF pattern, DNA sequence analysis of the coding exons of the Vmunich alpha 1AT gene was carried out using the polymerase chain reaction. The Vmunich allele differed from the common normal M1(Val213) alpha 1AT allele by a single nucleotide substitution of cytosine for adenosine, with the resultant amino acid change Asp2 GAT----Ala GCT. Inheritance of the allele was confirmed by family analysis using allele-specific amplification with the polymerase chain reaction. The Asp2----Ala mutation explains the cathodal position of the Vmunich protein on IEF, as there is a substitution of a negatively charged amino acid by a neutral one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nucleotide sequences of the major noncoding region of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 95 human placentas have been determined. These sequences include at least a 482-bp-long region encompassing most of the D-loop-forming region. Comparisons of these sequences with those previously determined have revealed remarkable features of nucleotide substitutions and insertion/deletion events. The nucleotide diversity among the sequences is estimated as 1.45%, which is three- to fourfold higher than the corresponding value estimated from restriction-enzyme analysis of whole mtDNA genome. A hypervariable region has also been defined. In this 14-bp region, 17 different sequences were detected. More than 97% of the base changes are transitions. A significantly nonrandom distribution of nucleotide substitutions and sequence length variations were also noted. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that diversity among the negroids is much larger than that among the caucasoids or the mongoloids. In fact, part of the negroids first diverged from other humans in the phylogenetic tree. A striking finding in the phylogenetic analysis is that the mongoloids can be separated into two distinct groups. Divergence of part of the mongoloids follows the earliest divergence of part of the negroids. The remainder of the mongoloids subsequently diverged together with the caucasoids. This observation confirmed our earlier study, which clearly demonstrated, by the restriction-enzyme analysis, existence of two distinct groups in the Japanese.\r"

The biochemical mechanism underlying this effect is unknown but may result from decreased affinity of the mutant enzyme for thiamine or from stabilization of the abnormal enzyme by thiamine. The E1 alpha subunit of the complex participates in the thiamine-dependent decarboxylation of branched-chain alpha-ketoacids. We sequenced the E1 alpha subunit by using reverse transcription of RNA followed by enzymatic amplification of cDNA in two patients with thiamine-responsive maple syrup urine disease. The deduced amino acid sequence of this subunit in the patients was identical to that in normal controls, suggesting that in the patients the thiamine-binding site is abnormal because of a mutation in the E1 beta subunit. Other possible explanations are (a) that a mutation in the E1 beta or E2 subunits either alters thiamine binding by E1 alpha because of allosteric interactions or causes the complex to be unstable and (b) that thiamine stabilizes the complex.\r"

In most studies, blacks are shown to have the highest overall mortality rate from cardiovascular disease--higher than the rate for Hispanics, and substantially higher than the rate for whites and Asians. In some of these studies, blacks also have higher rates of both hypertension-related stroke and coronary artery disease. In some of the major clinical trials, Hispanic patients have the next-highest death rate from high blood pressure and ischemic heart disease. In other, smaller studies, however, non-Hispanic whites have had comparable or higher age-adjusted death rates. Asians, by contrast, have significantly lower death rates from cardiovascular disease, irrespective of national origin, and they also have correspondingly lower mortality from stroke and other hypertension-related diseases. As in coronary artery disease, issues related to access to care may be implicated in the disproportionate morbidity and mortality rates noted in black and Hispanic patients, as well as among some lower-class segments of the non-Hispanic white population. Access to care may depend upon a number of factors, among them cultural isolation, public awareness, individual and group attitudes, perception of resource availability, actual resources, socioeconomic status, educational level, and peer behavior.\r"

Although most such reactions are mild, the potential for acute and life-threatening reactions cannot be underestimated when considering readministration of beta-lactam agents, such as the penicillins or cephalosporins, to persons who have previously exhibited sensitivity. In addition to concerns about possible allergic reactions to the beta-lactam antibiotics individually, considerable cross-reactivity has been demonstrated among such classes as the penicillins, the cephalosporins, and the imipenems, although it cannot yet be predicted on an individual basis. Early studies of the unique monocyclic beta-lactam--or monobactam--aztreonam, indicated that the new class demonstrated negligible cross-reactivity with the standard beta-lactams both experimentally and clinically.Further, aztreonam was associated with an extremely low (2 percent) incidence of immunologic drug reactions. Aztreonam also has been found to be well-tolerated by highly penicillin-allergic patients. Although further clinical study is indicated, data so far are encouraging. If it is confirmed that monobactams such as aztreonam are minimally cross-reactive, well-tolerated by subjects allergic to other beta-lactam antibiotics, and only weakly immunogenic, fewer allergic reactions may be associated with antimicrobial therapy in the future than have been seen with the other available beta-lactam antibiotic drugs.\r"

In the 48- to 72-hour interim between presentation and the availability of reliable culture and sensitivity data that allow for definitive therapy, empiric therapy is extremely important. Aztreonam, the first member of the monobactam class of monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics, is highly active against most gram-negative aerobic bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Its spectrum of activity is similar to that of the aminoglycosides but without the toxicity associated with those agents. For this reason, aztreonam may play an important role in empiric therapy. Currently, it can be recommended as single-agent empiric therapy only for severe urinary tract infections, but in combination with a variety of other agents, it has proved useful against a wide range of bacterial infections, and in certain subgroups, such as penicillin-allergic patients, it may represent the treatment of choice. It is not yet clear whether aztreonam is superior to other relatively nontoxic agents, such as the third-generation cephalosporins or carbapenems, but there is little doubt that this new agent is a generally safe and effective drug for the treatment of suspected gram-negative sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "Frail and vulnerable elderly patients, recognized primarily by the presence of such disabilities as immobility, incontinence, and dementia, are at particularly high risk for the development of infectious diseases, which are the leading cause of hospitalization in this population. The infectious diseases most often observed in the debilitated elderly are pneumonias, urinary tract infections, skin infections, and gastroenteritis, with fever a common manifestation. Some of the factors identified as contributing to their increased susceptibility include diminishing physiologic functioning; compromised host-defense mechanisms; increased incidence of mechanical risk factors, such as pressure ulcers, indwelling or condom catheters, feeding tubes, and soft tissue injuries; and comorbidities such as soft tissue or pulmonary edema. In addition to the common infecting pathogens found in the general population, these unique compromising factors increase the risk of elderly patients for aerobic gram-negative bacillary infection. Further increasing the therapeutic dilemma are ethical considerations involved in prolonging treatment that might be considered medical intervention beyond what is routine and necessary. Although the decision to treat must be made on an individual basis, studies have not always shown treatment to provide benefits in terms of quality of life. Once it is decided to treat, however, appropriate therapy is crucial. One of the most important considerations is renal function, which impacts on effectiveness, toxicity, and cost of therapy and is likely to be diminished in elderly patients. A non-nephrotoxic agent, such as aztreonam, may be a more appropriate therapeutic choice than an aminoglycoside antibiotic in this patient population.\r"

Predisposing factors include altered upper respiratory tract flora and altered barriers that normally protect the sterile lower respiratory tract from invasion by pharyngeal bacteria. Aztreonam, which is highly active against most gram-negative pathogens and which does not cause nephrotoxicity, has been evaluated in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia. In vitro and pharmacokinetic data on aztreonam indicate that this agent provides an alternative agent for use when resistance to cephalosporin and aminoglycoside antibiotics has developed. Data further suggest that aztreonam may interact synergistically with aminoglycosides against gram-negative pathogens. Clinical study supports the usefulness of aztreonam against gram-negative nosocomial pneumonia. Since aztreonam is inactive against gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, it must be used in combination with other antibiotics when these pathogens are suspected.\r"

The authors studied the number, viability, and ultrastructure of PAM recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage from normal and HIV-infected subjects, and their ability to phagocytose and kill Staphylococcus aureus. PAM from HIV-infected subjects who did not have pneumonia were present in greater numbers and phagocytosed significantly more opsonized Staphylococcus aureus (32.5% and 27.3% for nonsmokers and smokers, respectively) than did PAM from healthy controls (19.5% and 18.2%). In 15 patients with AIDS and pneumonia (due to Pneumocystis carinii in 13/15), viability of PAM and their phagocytic capacity were significantly reduced; in smokers with AIDS and pneumonia, the PAM yield was also dramatically decreased. Killing of S. aureus was similar by PAM from all patient groups. HIV infection was associated with the electron microscopic finding in PAM of extensively ruffled PAM cell-surfaces and ingestion of lymphocytes. Thus, HIV infection stimulates the phagocytic capacity and produces morphologic changes consistent with the possibility that PAM are activated by this retroviral infection. In patients with AIDS who develop pneumonia, especially in smokers, the number, viability and phagocytic capacity of PAM are significantly decreased; our study could not determine whether this diminished activity reflects evolution of the HIV infection or a secondary effect of the pneumonia.\r"

Although all clinicians tended to underestimate CVP, only the residents did so significantly (p less than 0.05). Sensitivity and specificity, and agreement and correlation between the clinicians' assessment and catheter measurements were higher when ventilated patients were excluded.

The only scientific, objective means of diagnosing fetal asphyxia at delivery is through umbilical blood acid-base studies. This test is convenient, noninvasive, and accurate.

Logistic regression was used to control for potentially confounding factors, including number of recent sexual partners, frequency of intercourse, and previous episodes of gonorrhea. Compared with women who had never smoked, current cigarette smokers had a significantly elevated relative risk of pelvic inflammatory disease of 1.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.5). Similarly, former cigarette smokers had a significantly elevated relative risk of pelvic inflammatory disease of 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 4.2). However, a dose-response relationship was not observed. These results suggest that cigarette smoking is associated with pelvic inflammatory disease. Whether or not this association is causal requires clarification. The high prevalence of cigarette smoking and the serious consequences of pelvic inflammatory disease make such clarification an important consideration for future research.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between infection with different human papillomavirus types and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was studied in a group of 398 women seen in a private gynecology practice in Washington, D.C. Each woman was assessed for human papillomavirus infection by Southern blot hybridization analysis of cervical cells obtained by swab. The human papillomavirus results were correlated with the results of Papanicolaou smears taken the same day and with data abstracted from medical records regarding past cervical disease. Subjects with normal cytologic findings at the time of human papillomavirus testing were followed up for an average of 2 to 3 years with additional Papanicolaou smears. At the time of human papillomavirus testing, 58% (19/33) of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia had detectable human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in contrast to 10% (28/289) of women with normal cytologic findings (p less than 0.001). This association persisted after statistical adjustment for age and current use of oral contraceptives, a factor that appeared to increase the detection of human papillomavirus. Among women with no current cytologic evidence of neoplasia, human papillomavirus detection was more likely in those with a history of past genital neoplasia (p = 0.05). In the follow-up study, 15% (3 of 20) of cytologically normal women who were human papillomavirus-positive at baseline subsequently exhibited cervical cells suggestive of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia compared with only 5% (9 of 195) of human papillomavirus-negative women. However, this difference reflected recurrent and not incident neoplasia.\r"

We routinely use this material for the detection by molecular hybridization of human papillomavirus infection of the cervix. We have analyzed deoxyribonucleic acid isolated from cervicovaginal cells by Southern blot hybridization to detect a common restriction fragment length polymorphism on chromosome 13. We suggest that in the near future most, if not all, major human genetic disease loci will be cloned and their mutations will be identified. With this knowledge and innovative methods, such as the polymerase chain reaction, it will be possible to distinguish normal individuals who harbor a variety of recessive genetic mutations that may place them at risk to produce offspring with serious genetic diseases. We propose that both genetic and cancer screening can be performed during the same office visit. Such testing offers the advantage of identification of women at risk for genetic disease with a noninvasive procedure before or concurrent with childbearing. Easily accessible genetic material extracted from exfoliated cervicovaginal cells can also be used for population genetic studies.\r"

Cohen's d, the overall effect size as determined by Tukey's jackknife method, was -0.001 (95% confidence interval = -0.018 to 0.017).

Pregnancy complications as a result of trauma occurred in 18 of 205 patients (8.8%): premature labor (n = 10), placental separation (n = 5), fetal injury (n = 1), and fetal death (n = 2). Multiple regression analysis of the data base showed obstetric findings (contractions, uterine tenderness, and bleeding) on presentation to be highly associated with complications (17/88; 19.3%). In their absence complications were rare (1/117; 0.9%). Detectable fetomaternal hemorrhage was significantly more common in trauma patients (18/205) than in control subjects (2/110) (p less than 0.01), but its role in managing trauma patients was limited to detection of rare massive hemorrhage (1/205) and detection of rare hemorrhage exceeding that covered by the standard Rho (D) immune globulin dose (2/205). Fetomaternal hemorrhage need not be quantitated in patients who lack obstetric findings on presentation. Despite rare reports of delayed abruptio placentae, it is doubtful that prolonged observation (greater than 2 to 3 hours) in the hospital is necessary in patients who lack obstetric findings on initial presentation.\r"

  ".W": "Prostaglandin E2 production by amnion is thought to be an important event in the onset of human labor. It has been suggested that 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, also produced in the amnion, may mediate prelabor contractions. For either of these compounds to play a paracrine role they need to cross the chorion, which has a high capacity to metabolize prostaglandins. With the use of an in vitro system we have shown that both prostaglandin E2 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid cross either amnion or intact amnion-chorion-decidua at a rate similar to that of an extracellular marker sucrose. Analysis by high performance liquid chromatography revealed that at physiologic concentrations neither prostaglandin E2 nor 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid were metabolized by amnion alone. Moreover, 100% of the 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 72% of the prostaglandin E2 remained in the active form after passage across intact amnion-chorion-decidua. There did not appear to be any difference in the rate of transfer or permeability of the membranes before or after spontaneous labor. We conclude that both 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and prostaglandin E2 synthesised in the amnion can cross the membranes by diffusion through the extracellular space, remaining largely unmetabolized, and may play a role in the onset of human labor.\r"

Prostaglandin E2 was given in the following manner: 0.5 mg in gel strictly intracervically (n = 4), extraamniotically (n = 4), or prostaglandin E2 (4 mg) in gel vaginally (n = 4). The myometrial activity was registered over a period of 30 minutes before and at least 3 hours after gel application by means of an extraamniotic microtransducer catheter. After both extraamniotic and vaginal gel application, myometrial activity was significantly increased compared with intracervical application. All the women had favorable cervical states 6 hours after treatment and were delivered vaginally within 24 hours. All infants were delivered in good condition with 1-minute Apgar scores greater than 7. From these results we conclude that proper intracervical prostaglandin E2 gel application, in contrast to extraamniotic or vaginal application, induces cervical ripening without significant myometrial activity. Because careful intracervical application appears to avoid or minimize the risks of myometrial hyperstimulation, this technique should be considered particularly in women with unfavorable cervices and delicate fetuses.\r"

Single-gloved hands revealed the presence of visible blood in 38% of cases (n = 42) whereas visible blood was noted in only 2% of double-gloved hands (n = 48) (p less than 0.001). These results demonstrate that the sterile barrier between surgeon and patient was compromised intraoperatively and that particles the size of red blood cells were able to cross this barrier. In addition, these data suggest single gloving may be less than optimal in maintaining a sterile barrier, as well as strongly suggesting that double gloving can improve the integrity of the patient-surgeon sterile barrier during pelvic surgery.\r"

Selection of the donor site is an aspect of the procedure that is very important for preventing highly visible lifelong scars. In this regard the mons pubis is an excellent choice as a donor site. Scar visibility is minimized by regrowth of the pubic hair. Another advantage is the anterior location of the mons, which allows for healing without constant pressure in patients who must remain supine in the postoperative period. Graft harvesting requires shaving the mons pubis and injecting saline solution into the subcutaneous tissue to elevate the skin and thus provide a firm flat base for dermatome application. Hair growth does not occur in the recipient site because the hair follicles are not harvested. Healing of both donor and recipient sites has been excellent with minimal discomfort during pubic hair regrowth. Thus it is recommended that the mons pubis be given serious consideration as a graft donor site in gynecologic surgery.\r"

During the period 1971 through 1985, the incidence of ectopic pregnancy concurrent with induced abortions was 1.35/1000 induced abortions, compared with 13.6/1000 pregnancies not terminated by induced or spontaneous abortion. The rate was higher among women who obtained abortions at earlier gestational age and among older women. The death-to-case rate for ectopic pregnancies concurrent with induced abortion was 1.3 times higher than that for women not undergoing abortion. Most of the deaths of women with ectopic pregnancy who underwent induced abortion were attributable to the failure to diagnose the ectopic pregnancy before the woman left the facility where the abortion was performed. Such deaths could be prevented by the provider of the abortion assuring that the tissue is examined for products of conception at the time of the abortion.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombocytopenia occurred in 513 (7.6%) of 6715 consecutive deliveries that occurred in our hospital over a 3-year interval. The patients with thrombocytopenia could be divided into three groups. The largest group (65.1%) consisted of healthy women whose thrombocytopenia was incidentally detected. The next group of patients (13.1%) was composed of healthy women who had an obstetric or medical condition such as diabetes or premature labor. No mother or infant in either group had excessive bleeding, and no infant had a cord platelet count less than 50 x 10(9) per liter. The last group (21%) was composed of hypertensive patients and patients with immune thrombocytopenia. Two infants in this group had cord platelet counts less than 50 x 10(9) per liter, but neither had bleeding. This study indicates that incidental thrombocytopenia in an otherwise well woman at term is the most frequent type of thrombocytopenia and poses no apparent risk for mother or infant at delivery.\r"

  ".W": "Histidyl proline diketopiperazine values have been established in human amniotic fluid (n = 81) and maternal serum (n = 36) throughout gestation (10 to 42 weeks). Newborn cord serum (n = 10) and first-voided fetal urine (n = 10) levels were also documented. These measurements reveal increasing amniotic fluid levels with term gestation values (15,551 pg/ml) nearly thirteen-fold higher than maternal serum concentrations (1150 pg/ml). Corresponding fetal urine and cord serum concentrations were 16,781 and 2160 pg/ml, respectively. The amniotic fluid values are not influenced by fetal sex or maternal labor, nor do they correlate with amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein levels. However, there is a significant inverse correlation (r = -0.628; p less than 0.0001) between amniotic fluid prolactin and histidyl proline diketopiperazine after midgestation. The hypothesis that histidyl proline diketopiperazine may be a regulatory peptide for decidual prolactin production was tested by culturing term decidua in the presence of varying concentrations of histidyl proline diketopiperazine, but no inhibitory effect was observed. Decidual cultures did not produce measurable amounts of histidyl proline diketopiperazine. It is suggested that amniotic fluid histidyl proline diketopiperazine is derived from fetal urine.\r"

The frequency of diarrhea, discharge, and bleeding remained constant. Of the various warning signs, only diarrhea and discharge were associated with the diagnosis of preterm labor.

Various patterns of contractions tended to be associated with higher rates of preterm labor and preterm delivery, but results were generally not statistically significant.

This study evaluates fetal acoustic stimulation in the early intrapartum period as a predictor of subsequent fetal condition. The study group consisted of 201 patients, approximately 60% of whom had complicated pregnancies. All were in the latent phase of labor with singleton, vertex-presenting fetuses. Gestational age ranged from 37 to 43 weeks. Fourteen of the 201 fetuses (7%) showed a nonreactive response to fetal acoustic stimulation and those fetuses were at significantly greater risk of initial and subsequent abnormal fetal heart rate patterns, meconium staining, and cesarean delivery because of fetal distress and Apgar scores less than 7 at both 1 and 5 minutes. Transient fetal heart rate decelerations after a reactive response occurred in 25% of patients; however, fetal outcome was not worse in this group. A reactive response to fetal acoustic stimulation was associated with high specificity and negative predictive values. Therefore we conclude that fetal acoustic stimulation in the early intraprtum period may discriminate the compromised from the noncompromised fetus.\r"

All patients had serial evaluation of renal function, urine microscopy, and electrolyte studies at the onset of acute renal failure and on follow-up. There were three immediate maternal deaths (two in the pure preeclampsia group and one in the other group). Nine patients (50%) in the \"pure\" group required dialysis during hospitalization and all 18 patients had acute tubular necrosis. Five patients (42%) in the other group required immediate dialysis and three patients had bilateral cortical necrosis. The majority of pregnancies in both groups were complicated by abruptio placentae and hemorrhage. All 16 surviving patients in the pure preeclampsia group had normal renal function on long-term follow-up (average 4.0 +/- 3.1 years). Conversely, nine of the 11 surviving patients in the second group required long-term dialysis on follow-up and four of them ultimately died of end-stage renal disease. We conclude that proper management of acute renal failure in patients with pure preeclampsia-eclampsia does not result in residual function impairment.\r"

We measured digoxin-like immunoreactive substance levels every 2 weeks throughout the third trimester in 170 women; of these, 20 developed hypertension. Digoxin-like immunoreactive substance levels rose with gestational age. A graph of the slope of digoxin-like immunoreactive substance plotted against gestational age was fitted for the results obtained from each woman. There was no significant difference in the mean rate of increase of digoxin-like immunoreactive substance level per week between pregnancy-induced hypertension and normotensive pregnancy, nor was there any difference between these two groups at any gestational age studied.

Data analysis revealed a significantly higher urine output in the nifedipine group during the first 24 hours after delivery (3834 versus 2057 ml; p less than 0.05). A significant reduction in mean arterial pressure was also noted in the nifedipine group between 18 and 24 hours postpartum (93.9 versus 100.2 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in the systolic or diastolic blood pressures, pulse, laboratory study results, or the need to administer hydralazine to control blood pressure.

The urine was recollected by suprapubic aspiration and bacteriuria was confirmed in 52%, corresponding to an incidence of bladder bacteriuria of 3.7%. A history of past urinary tract infection, bacteriuria in pregnancy, operative delivery, epidural anesthesia, and bladder catheterization increased the risk of postpartum urinary tract infection. Only 21% of the women complained of dysuria; this symptom occurred significantly more often after operative delivery and in patients with previous urinary tract infection. Two hundred fifty-one women with bladder bacteriuria were subjected to different treatments by randomized allocation: 153 patients with amoxicillin-susceptible bacterias were selected for amoxicillin treatment of 1, 3, and 10 days' duration. The cure rates were 84%, 94%, and 98%, respectively; the single-dose therapy was significantly less effective than 10 days' treatment (p less than 0.05). Forty-six women with amoxicillin-resistant bacterial infections received cephalexin or nitrofurantoin therapy of 7 days' duration; the cure rate was 91%. Fifty-two women served as control subjects and received no treatment. Ten weeks later 27% still had persistent bacteriuria in their suprapubic aspiration control specimens. All therapeutic regimens except the single-dose method showed a cure rate that was significantly higher than the spontaneous cure rate (p less than 0.05). Multiparity seemed to be a predisposing factor for persistence of bacteriuria. The study indicates that puerperal patients with positive midstream urine specimens should not be automatically treated, but more thoroughly examined. In cases of confirmed bladder bacteriuria, treatment should be recommended; 3 days' therapy appears to be sufficient.\r"

A multivariate analysis showed that increased log human chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit levels within the range of 20 to 500 mIU/ml, intrauterine tissue demonstrated by ultrasonography, higher gestational age, and active bleeding were significant predictive variables for the presence of villi in curettage specimens. A mathematical formula and a clinical scoring system for the prediction of residual villi in these cases were devised and were applied to the data of our study group. The sensitivity, false-negative rate, and specificity of the scoring system were 90.9%, 2.2%, and 59.2%, respectively; however, the false-positive rate was 75.6%. By use of this scoring system in patients with first-trimester abortion and low human chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit level, the presence of villi in curettage specimens can thus be predicted with a high sensitivity and as many as 60% of curettage procedures might be prevented.\r"

At a final concentration of 0.1% bacterial conditioned medium, a significant stimulation of prostaglandin E2 production from amnion cells was observed for this range of microorganisms. Conditioned medium obtained from culturing Bacteroides fragilis caused a dose-related increase in prostaglandin production, final concentrations of 0.02% to 0.1% being stimulatory but greater concentrations (0.1% to 10%) causing a progressive inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. A similar concentration-related response in which stimulation was followed by inhibition occurred on addition of increasing concentrations of phospholipase A2 to amnion cells. These data suggest that bacterial phospholipase may release arachidonic acid from amnion leading to prostaglandin E2 synthesis, but excessive addition of phospholipase and consequent increased arachidonic acid availability may give rise to substrate inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzyme and inhibit prostaglandin E2 synthesis. Overall it appears that a wide variety of microorganisms associated with preterm labor may secrete phospholipase, which liberates amnion arachidonic acid for conversion to the oxytocic agent prostaglandin E2.\r"

Respiratory exchange ratio was 0.9 at 36 to 39 weeks' gestation and 0.8 at 5-13 weeks post partum. Respiratory frequency did not change during pregnancy. The increase in minute ventilation is in excess of the increase of carbon dioxide production and the resultant fall in end-tidal carbon dioxide tension reflects a fall in systemic arterial blood carbon dioxide tension. The greater respiratory exchange ratio during late pregnancy as compared with post partum also reflects this hyperventilation during pregnancy. Fourteen subjects with pregnancy-induced hypertension studied cross-sectionally failed to show any difference in the respiratory variables measured when compared with normotensive subjects at a similar length of gestation.\r"

Myometrial alpha 2-adrenergic receptor density falls sharply late in gestation, and diminished presynaptic neuromodulation could contribute to increased norepinephrine release reported at this time. Two studies were performed to investigate this potentially important mechanism. First, when alpha 2-adrenergic receptors were measured in well-innervated (tubal end and cervix), denervated (perifetal), and richly vascularized regions (placental) of late pregnant guinea pig uteri with the selective radioligand [3H]rauwolscine, high levels were detected in perifetal myometrium, particularly outside the site of placental implantation. Second, we report an unsuccessful attempt to demonstrate alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated feedback suppression of electrically stimulated norepinephrine release from tubal and cervical regions of nonpregnant, midterm, and late-pregnant uteri. Together these results suggest that guinea pig myometrial alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are located mostly postjunctionally and are not associated with the vasculature. Thus an alpha 2-adrenergic feedback mechanism is unlikely to play an important role regulating uterine sympathetic neurotransmission.\r"

By day 8, immunoreactivity was most pronounced in knobs interacting directly with uterine epithelium but was noted in nonknob cytotrophoblast as well. Fetal membranes, identified by day 10, were stained intensely on all days examined. In later gestation the trophoblast was stained intensely on the surface and in the cytoplasm, with some staining over nuclei. No appreciable changes in the staining pattern were observed after day 10. Uterine epithelium demonstrated epidermal growth factor receptor staining first on the antimesometrial (day 7) and then the paraplacental epidermal (day 9). After day 10, most staining was at the embryo-maternal interphase.

To evaluate the role of the conceptus in maternal blood pressure regulation, we measured the changes in systolic blood pressure b (by tail-cuff plethysmography) throughout gestation and mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and organ blood flows (with radioactive microspheres) on postmating day 21 for calculation of total peripheral and organ vascular resistances in spontaneously hypertensive rats with litter size surgically adjusted to 0 to 10 conceptuses on postmating day 7. Blood pressure remained elevated in those rats with zero fetuses but decreased during the last week of pregnancy in those rats with three or more fetuses. The magnitude of the decrease was directly related to litter size. At term, cardiac output was positively correlated (r = 0.61; p less than 0.001), whereas mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance were negatively correlated (r = -0.74; p less than 0.001 and r = -0.79; p less than 0.001, respectively) with litter size. Resistances of all the vascular beds in the body, except the kidneys, spleen, and hepatic artery were also negatively correlated with fetal number. Thus pregnancy is characterized by a generalized maternal vasodilation, and the fetal/placental unit may play a significant role in modulating maternal vascular tone.\r"

Deoxyribonucleic acid aneuploidy was associated with tumor size, histologic grade, clinical stage, and high S-phase fraction. Deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy and S-phase fraction value were independent prognostic parameters, together with the presence of lymph node metastases and tumor size. In conclusion, our results indicate that flow cytometric deoxyribonucleic acid analysis helps to predict the prognosis and may thus influence the choice of treatment.\r"

Incubation of cervical epithelial cells with the spin-trap N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone and subsequent examination by electron spin resonance spectroscopy gave signals from a nitroxide radical, which has been tentatively assigned to an adduct from either a carbon-centered lipid radical or a lipid alkoxyl radical; no significant differences in either the type of radical detected or the intensity of the signals was found between patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and normal control subjects. There was no significant correlation between the intensity of the electron spin resonance signal and the phospholipid-esterified 18:2(9,11)/18:2(9,12) molar ratio. This finding provides no support for the classification of 18:2(9,11) as a \"free radical product.\"\r"

Human synthetic amylin amide (30 to 300 pmol/site) stimulated a dose-dependent increase in blood flow after intradermal injection in rabbit skin. Amylin amide was 100 times less active than the structurally related potent vasodilator neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide. Amylin amide did not induce edema formation; however, as a consequence of its vasodilator activity, amylin amide potentiated edema formation induced in rabbit skin by bradykinin. The intravenous injection of amylin amide (10 nmol) caused a systemic drop in blood pressure. This study demonstrates that amylin amide elicits vasodilator responses in vivo. It is possible that the release of amylin amide from the pancreas in type II diabetes could lead to changes in vascular tone.\r"

There was no detectable xanthine dehydrogenase activity in plasma from either limb. Plasma also contained evidence of products consistent with the formation of oxygen-derived free radicals, namely, the appearance predominantly in the reperfused limb of hemoglobin and fluorescent compounds. These data indicate for the first time in humans that ischemia-reperfusion events are associated with the appearance of xanthine oxidase activity and its products in the plasma effluent.\r"

  ".W": "Testicular germ cell tumors can be prevented if the neoplasia is diagnosed at the stage of carcinoma in situ (CIS). Hyperdiploid DNA content is one of the markers of CIS germ cells. We developed a noninvasive procedure for detection of CIS of the testis by means of a nonradioactive in situ hybridization assay with a probe for chromosome 1. Seminal cytospin smears from 2 men with isolated CIS changes, from 6 men in whom CIS was combined with a tumor, and from 16 control men without evidence of testicular neoplasia were tested. Ejaculates from men with CIS contained on average 2.6% hyperdiploid cells, whereas the corresponding percentage in the smears from controls was 0.2 (P = 0.009). In a blind study we identified samples from both patients with isolated CIS changes and from 3 of the 6 men in whom CIS was accompanied by a tumor, based on the percentage of the hyperdiploid cells. No false-positive results were obtained. Thus this study confirmed findings of previous immunocytochemical and flow cytometric studies that indicated exfoliation of CIS germ cells into seminal fluid. For detection of aneuploid cells in semen, in situ hybridization may be a more sensitive technique than flow cytometry. Applied on seminal samples, in situ hybridization may become a valuable and fast tool for diagnosis of CIS and thereby for prevention of testicular cancer.\r"

  ".W": "We and others have published data that indicate that the role played by microtubules and microfilaments in biliary secretion is as follows: microtubules play a part in secretion and microfilaments play a part in the canalicular contraction. To further study the role of the cytoskeleton in canalicular contraction, we observed the contraction of bile canaliculi (BC) induced by vasopressin (VP) in cultured differentiated hepatocytes treated with several agents that selectively rearrange the cytoskeleton. The hepatocytes obtained from 14-day-old rats were cultured for 48 hours. The BC formed between the cells were dilated and closely sealed by junctional complexes. Ruthenium red stain showed that the junctional complexes of the BC were tightly sealed. Cytoskeletal changes were observed by double-labeled fluorescence microscopy. A spontaneous contraction of the BC was rarely seen during a 60-minute observation period in controls. When the hepatocytes were incubated with VP (10(-8) M), the canalicular contraction began at 30 minutes, gradually progressed, and was complete by 60 minutes. The contraction was reversed after 60 minutes of incubation in VP-free medium. In cytochalasin B-treated hepatocytes, actin appeared to form pools around the dilated BC, and the canalicular contraction after VP was rarely observed. In colchicine-treated hepatocytes, the microtubules were depolymerized. Although the BC appeared unaffected by colchicine alone, the canalicular contraction induced by VP was markedly decreased. beta-lumicolchicine had no effect on the cytoskeleton or on the canalicular contraction. Mg2(+)-ATPase histochemistry revealed that the BC that did not contract after VP contained little Mg2(+)-ATPase reaction product. When the BC contracted, diverticula came off to form diacytotic vesicles, as indicated by the presence of the BC marker enzyme reaction product within the vesicles. Colchicine treatment blocked the diacytotic process. This prevented the contraction stimulated by VP, because all of the routes of escape of the canalicular contents were blocked off, including diacytosis. In conclusion, the integrity of actin filaments and Mg2(+)-ATPase is necessary for VP-induced contraction, and the integrity of microtubules is essential for regurgitation of BC content (diacytosis).\r"

DOC-salt-treated rats without binder demonstrated marked glomerular hypertrophy, many globally sclerosed glomeruli, severe proteinuria, focal cardiac fibrosis, and splenomegaly. A significant reduction of glomerular hypertrophy, glomerulosclerosis, severity of proteinuria, splenomegaly, and the myocardial lesion took place when the DOC-salt-treated rats were given phosphate binder. The globally sclerosed glomeruli exhibited remarkable hypertrophy while structurally preserved glomeruli showed little evidence of enlargement. The plasma phosphate level was low in rats with dietary phosphate binder. In conclusion, the dietary phosphate binder ameliorated glomerular hypertrophy, glomerulosclerosis, proteinuria, myocardial fibrosis, and splenomegaly occurring in DOC-salt-treated rats. The data indicated that there was an association between glomerular hypertrophy and glomerulosclerosis in this model. The exact mechanisms of action of the phosphate binder, however, remain far from clear.\r"

Insulin-like growth factor-1, rat multiplication-stimulating activity, and platelet-derived growth factor had no effect on proliferation of cultured GEC exposed to heparin (100 micrograms/ml). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) partially reversed heparin-induced growth inhibition in a dose-dependent fashion with a maximum effect seen at 1 ng/ml. No additive effect was seen with combinations of EGF and the other growth factors assayed. A decrease in EGF-stimulated incorporation of 3H-thymidine by GEC was seen with as little as 2 hours of heparin exposure and persisted for up to 48 hours. Heparin consistently increased binding of 125I-EGF to GEC with a significant increase apparent after 2 hours of exposure and a further increase with a 24-hour exposure. Increased EGF binding to heparin-treated cells was due to a significant increase in the association constant of EGF and its receptor with no effect on receptor number. Interactions between GEC and heparinlike glycosaminoglycans in the glomerular basement membrane may play a role in the regulation of GEC proliferation in normal and diseased states.\r"

  ".U": "90196172\r", 
  ".W": "Cell death by apoptosis mediates several important physiologic and pathologic processes and appears to be intrinsically programmed. Its characteristic features are distinctive morphologic changes of nucleus and cytoplasm, along with cleavage of chromatin at regularly spaced sites. Here we study DNA organization and nuclear structure in apoptotic thymocytes to define the cleavage event and, by implication, the role of the responsible endonuclease. We show that in apoptosis, double-stranded cleavage of DNA generates two classes of chromatin fragments: 70% of DNA exists as long, H1-rich oligonucleosomes bound to the nucleus, and 30% comprises short oligonucleosomes and mononucleosomes, which are depleted in H1, enriched in HMG1 and 2, and not attached to the nucleus. This minority class probably derives from chromatin in a transcriptionally active configuration, which would allow better access to enzymes in the nucleoplasm, producing more complete digestion. The characteristic nucleolar morphology in apoptosis can also be explained in terms of cleavage of the transcriptionally active ribosomal genes, with conservation of the nucleolin-rich fibrillar center. The chromatin cleavage, nucleolar morphologic changes, and chromatin condensation were closely mimicked by micrococcal nuclease digestion of normal thymocyte nuclei in the presence of protease inhibitors. Thus, in apoptosis, selective activation of an endogenous endonuclease appears to be responsible not only for widespread chromatin cleavage but also for the major nuclear morphologic changes.\r"

To test the hypothesis that smooth muscle cell proteoglycan synthesis may be modified by macrophage products, pigeon arterial smooth muscle cells were exposed to the media of either cholesteryl ester-loaded pigeon peritoneal macrophages or a macrophage cell line P388D1. Proteoglycans radiolabeled with [35S]sulfate and [3H]serine were isolated from culture media and smooth muscle cells and purified following precipitation with 1-hexadecylpyridinium chloride and chromatography. Increasing concentrations of macrophage-conditioned media were associated with a dose-response increase in [35S]sulfate incorporation into secreted proteoglycans, but there was no change in cell-associated proteoglycans. Incorporation of [3H]serine into total proteoglycan core proteins was not significantly different (5.2 X 10(5) dpm and 5.5 X 10(5) disintegrations per minute (dpm) in control and conditioned media-treated cultures, respectively), but selective effects were observed on individual proteoglycan types. Twofold increases in dermatan sulfate proteoglycan and limited degradation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan were apparent based on core proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Immunoinhibition studies indicated that interleukin-1 was involved in the modulation of proteoglycan synthesis by macrophage-conditioned media. These data provide support for the role of macrophages in alteration of the matrix proteoglycans synthesized by smooth muscle cells and provide a mechanism to account for the reported increased dermatan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate ratios in the developing atherosclerotic lesion.\r"

  ".W": "We previously demonstrated that pentoxifylline stimulated leukocyte migration in vitro and leukocyte accumulation in vivo and protects neonatal mice from experimentally induced Staphylococcus aureus infections. In the present studies we have investigated pentoxifylline's effect on human leukocyte function in vitro. In these studies we demonstrate that pentoxifylline at low concentrations (ie, 0.01 and 0.1 mg/ml) stimulates both leukocyte migration and microbicidal activity in vitro. Alternatively, low concentrations (0.001 to 0.1 mg/ml) of pentoxifylline had no significant effect on the binding uptake of S. aureus by leukocytes, nor did it enhance phagocytic degranulation. At extremely low concentrations (0.001 mg/ml), pentoxifylline enhanced oxygen metabolism by human leukocytes, as reflected by increased H2O2 production and chemiluminescence (CL). At higher concentrations (ie, 0.1 to 1 mg/ml), pentoxifylline consistently suppressed these leukocyte functions in vitro. Thus, this study supports the following hypothesis: 1) the in vivo effects of pentoxifylline may involve a direct effect on both leukocyte mobilization and microbicidal activity, and 2) the enhanced microbicidal activity induced by pentoxifylline may be a result of enhanced leukocyte oxygen metabolism. In summary, pentoxifylline appears to be an interesting immunomodulator (ie, immunoenhancement and immunosuppression) of leukocyte function in vitro, but additional studies will be required before the efficacy of pentoxifylline in man can be determined.\r"

  ".U": "90196176\r", 
  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to specific keratin subtypes were prepared and characterized by immunoblotting and immunohistochemical assays on human cell cultures and normal and malignant human tissues. Chain-specific MAbs to keratin 7 (RCK 105, OV-TL 12/30) and keratin 18 (RGE 53, RCK 106, CK18-2), as well as broadly cross-reacting keratin MAbs (RCK 102, OV-TL 12/5) could be shown to react with different types of human epithelial tissues and were therefore tested for their usefulness in the differential diagnosis of carcinomas. The two broad-spectrum antibodies stained virtually all of the more than 350 carcinomas tested, especially when combined, and distinguished them from most nonepithelial tumors. The keratin 18 MAbs distinguished adenocarcinomas (which are keratin 18 positive) from most squamous cell carcinomas (which are generally keratin 18 negative). The MAbs to keratin 7 could be shown to recognize specific subtypes of adenocarcinoma and could, for example, distinguish between ovarian carcinomas (keratin 7 positive) and carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract (keratin 7 negative), or between transitional cell carcinomas (keratin 7 positive) and prostate cancer (keratin 7 negative). In general, malignancies showed the expected keratin reactivity pattern as concluded from the keratin pattern of its cell of origin or its type of differentiation. The use of an extended series of malignancies did, however, also illustrate that exceptions to this rule exist. For example, certain antibodies to keratin 18 stained tumor areas in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. Also a certain percentage of tumors, which generally showed no keratin 7 expression, were positive with RCK 105 or OV-TL 12/30. On the other hand, a certain percentage of tumors, which were generally positive for keratin 7, did not show a staining reaction with these MAbs. Furthermore subtle differences between reactivity patterns of different MAbs recognizing the same keratin protein were observed, both in the normal and malignant human tissues, indicating that specific keratin epitopes may be masked in certain tissues and that unmasking of such epitopes can occur with malignant progression. This phenomenon may be of some use in a further subtyping of carcinomas, especially those of the gastrointestinal tract. Despite these exceptional staining patterns, the keratin MAbs described above have proved to be useful tools in the characterization of epithelial tumors in routine histopathology and cytopathology, in which they add to a more refined diagnosis of (adeno)carcinomas.\r"

This approach allowed the detection of individual keratins 4, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 18, and 19 at the single-cell level. By using an antibody recognizing keratins 5 and 8 (RCK 102) and two antibodies specific for keratin 8 (CAM 5.2 and M 20), it was also possible to derive information on the distribution of keratin 5. Our results show that during immature squamous metaplasia there is an acquisition of keratins typical of squamous epithelium, ie, keratins 4, 5, 13, and 14. This process continues during further differentiation to mature squamous metaplasia. In premalignant lesions the expression pattern of the progenitor reserve cells and immature squamous metaplastic epithelium is partly conserved. However, in most cases an induction in the expression of the keratins 4, 13, and 14 was observed. Furthermore, CIN III shows a more extensive expression of keratins typical of simple epithelia, ie, keratins 8 and 18, as compared to CIN I and CIN II.\r"

  ".W": "Enteroviruses are implicated as etiologic agents in the inflammatory diseases myocarditis and polymyositis. In this report, we show that a previous enterovirus exposure in mice can influence development of myocardial inflammation with a second enteroviral exposure. Inoculation of 25-day-old male C3H/HeJ mice with 10(3) or 10(5) plaque-forming units (PFU) of infectious or ultra violet (UV)-inactivated coxsackievirus B2 (CVB2), followed by inoculation 28 days later with 10(5) PFU of a myocarditic variant of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3-m) results in more intense myocardial inflammation and injury than is seen in age-matched mice inoculated with CVB3-m alone. More severe disease occurs with the lower primary dose of CVB2. Neutralizing antibody to CVB2 is detected early after primary inoculation and neutralizing antibody to CVB3 is first detected 5 days after secondary inoculation. In vitro proliferation of splenocytes from mice inoculated with one or both viruses occurs in response to both CVB2 and CVB3 antigens. We recently demonstrated that murine T cells are capable of recognizing an enterovirus group antigen. Thus cell-mediated immune responses to a conserved antigenic epitope(s) among the enteroviruses may be involved in the exacerbation of myocardial inflammatory disease during a second enterovirus infection. The secondary infection model described here may more accurately mirror virus-induced myocarditis in the human population because the majority of adults have been exposed to several enteroviruses before induction of disease.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial fibrosis can be produced in certain inbred strains of mice after coxsackievirus B subtype 3 (CVB3) infection. The mechanism responsible for this interstitial matrix alteration is unknown. The presumption is that fibrosis occurs in areas of myocyte damage and inflammation associated with viral infection, analogous to scar formation after cell injury in other organ systems. To test this hypothesis, we examined the hearts of A/J strain mice infected with three CVB3 variants (Crowell [CVB3-CR], Woodruff [CVB3-WD], and Lerner [CVB3-LR]), each known to cause different degrees of acute myocardial injury. With these three variants, virus was present in the heart until day 28 after inoculation but was absent thereafter. Fourteen days after inoculation, inflammation with myocyte necrosis was seen in discrete foci throughout the myocardium with all three variants. Collapse and disorganization of the usually delicate connective tissue matrix identifiable by silver impregnation was seen in these areas of myocyte injury. Persistent, diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of the myocardium was seen 55 days after inoculation with CVB3-WD and CVB3-LR, but hearts initially infected with CVB3-CR showed only rare interstitial lymphocytes comparable to uninfected control hearts. The focal scars produced by myocyte necrosis 14 days after inoculation were accentuated and heavily collagenized 55 days after inoculation with CVB3-WD and CVB3-LR; however, these foci were indistinct 55 days after inoculation with CVB3-CR. Furthermore, the usually delicate network of interstitial collagen fibers surrounding individual myocytes became thickened throughout the heart 55 days after inoculation with CVB3-WD and CVB3-LR, away from visibly scarred areas produced early after infection with these variants. This diffuse reticulin thickening was not seen after infection with the Crowell variant. Only the virus variants associated with persistent interstitial inflammation at day 55 developed major collagen matrix alterations and interstitial fibrosis. We conclude that this persistent interstitial lymphocytic infiltration reflects altered immune function related to specific virus variants in this animal strain. We postulate that these lymphocytes are part of a delayed immunopathogenic response uncoupled from the original viral injury and inflammatory damage. Potential mechanisms by which this interstitial lymphocytic infiltration results in fibrosis are discussed.\r"

Here we report that endothelial and smooth muscle cells of arterioles and venules near the bifurcations incorporated significantly increased levels of 3H-TdR 19 to 72 hours after chrysotile exposure. As many as 28% of the vessels had labeled cells 31 hours after exposure. No labeled cells were observed in vessels from sham-exposed or iron-exposed controls. This proliferative response resulted in a doubling of both the number of smooth muscle cells and the thickness of the smooth muscle cell layer, determined by ultrastructural morphometry 1 month after exposure. The fact that a variety of cell types incorporates 3H-TdR so rapidly after asbestos inhalation leads us to speculate that the response involves the release of diffusible growth factors.\r"

Moreover, both human and hamster pancreatic cancer share expression of some tumor-associated antigens, such as those with blood group specificities, including A, B, H, Leb, Lex, and Ley. By examining other antigens commonly expressed in human pancreatic cancer, we have found that monoclonal antibodies CO17-1A (recognizing 17-1A antigen), OC 125 (recognizing CA 125 antigen), B72.3 (recognizing TAG-72 and DU-PAN-2 react with induced pancreatic cancer in a pattern similar to that seen in human pancreatic cancer. Remarkably, although the epitopes of the antigens recognized by these three antibodies are different, many tumor cells were reactive with all these antibodies. However, in contrast to the human cancer, none of these antigens were expressed in the normal hamster pancreatic tissue, except for 17-1A. However, all of these antigens were expressed in some hamster tissues showing the same cellular localization as pancreatic cancer cells and corresponded, to a great extent, with findings in human tissue. Expression of these antigens was diminished in vitro (cell culture) but was regained in vivo (homologous transplantation). The results emphasize the usefulness of this experimental model for studying some aspects of tissue antigenicity, particularly as it relates to pancreatic cancer.\r"

Families of borderline adolescents were chronically disrupted, particularly during the patients' early childhoods. The traumatic childhood experiences of the borderline adolescents were similar to those of adults with borderline personality disorder in recent studies.\r"

Two GTTs were performed for each patient, one during the late follicular phase and one during the late luteal phase. Although many patients experienced symptoms of hypoglycemia during the GTT, the hypoglycemia symptoms were not specific to the luteal phase and did not resemble the patients' PMS symptoms.\r"

There were no significant relationships between any of the 18 questionnaire scores and a subject's quantity/frequency of drinking or his family history of alcoholism. There was only one significant correlation between the alcoholic fathers' type 2 characteristics, according to the type 1/type 2 theory, and the sons' questionnaire scores. The relevance of these findings to the theory is discussed.\r"

In the first case, a suicidal patient reacted to psychiatric life support measures (maximum observation) with increasingly life-threatening acting out, necessitating a difficult, seemingly paradoxical staff decision to withdraw life support. In the second, a patient felt to be improving killed herself when life support was withdrawn. The authors argue that there are clinical limits to psychiatric life support and an appropriate goal of psychiatric treatment is to maximize the chances for patient survival, rather than to attempt to guarantee such survival.\r"

The HIV-1 antibody seroprevalence rate for all persons tested was 5 percent. The highest seroprevalence rates were in male homosexual/bisexual intravenous drug users (23 percent) and homosexual/bisexual men (13 percent). There was a significant decrease in the HIV-1 antibody seroprevalence rate among clients during the 48-month period from 14 percent in the first six months to 3 percent in the last six months. This decrease coincided with an increase in the number of low-risk female clients and low-risk heterosexual male clients, and a decrease in the number of homosexual/bisexual males participating in the programs. These findings suggest the need for development and implementation of other strategies to identify and reach persons at highest risk for HIV-1 infection.\r"

Observations of workers indicated that environmental contamination arose from several sources. Among the 11 work stations with HBsAg environmental samples, eight had high work loads, seven had inappropriate behaviors, and nine had flawed laboratory techniques. This information suggests that a multifactorial approach is needed to minimize the risk of laboratory-associated infections.\r"

  ".W": "Between May 7 and June 7, 1986, 27 residents of a rural county in Maryland developed legionellosis, and two died. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 was cultured from the sputum of two patients and identified in lung tissue of a third patient by direct fluorescent antibody staining. An additional 11 patients had four-fold rises in antibody titer to L. pneumophila, and 13 had single titers greater than or equal to 1:256. To determine risk factors for disease, we performed a case-control study. Twelve of 16 case-patients reported visiting store A in the two weeks before onset of illness compared with four of 28 control-patients. A serologic survey of employees showed that employees of store A were 3.63 times more likely than control employees to have titers of antibody to L. pneumophila greater than or equal to 1:256 (95% confidence intervals 0.8, 16.7). Cultures of soil specimens, samples of water from the hot water system of store A and from stagnant ponds near store A collected five weeks after the end of the outbreak were negative for Legionella species. Store A was adjacent to a site of excavation and construction during May 1986, when the community was experiencing an extended drought. This investigation suggests that exposure to excavation and construction activity may be a risk factor for legionellosis.\r"

From 1980 to 1986, 2,306,533 skin tests, using five TU PPD, were performed on active-duty Navy and Marine Corps personnel, 0.97 percent of which were positive. A downward trend in positive tests was found with a high of 1.43 percent in 1980 and a low of 0.80 percent in 1983. Since 1984, the percentage of positive tests has remained the same or increased. Shore-based medical facilities around the world reported 1,491,646 skin tests with 1.07 percent positive; Navy ships reported 814,887 skin tests with 0.78 percent positive. PPD-positivity for ships in the Pacific area was higher (0.98 percent) than for ships in the Atlantic (0.62 percent). During this same period, the percentage of positive tests in Navy and Marine Corps recruits ranged from a high of 1.82 percent in 1981 to a low of 1.23 percent in 1986. Since 1984, the percentage of positive tests has remained relatively stable in recruits. The frequency of positive PPD tests found in this study is lower than the percentage positive (1.59 percent) found in active-duty Navy personnel in 1969 and the percentage positive (5.2 percent) found in a study of Navy and Marine Corps recruits between 1958 and 1969.\r"

The 8.9 percent tuberculin positivity rate in tenth grade students was significantly higher than the 5.1 percent rate found in seventh graders. A majority of those who were skin test positive were born outside the United States. These results suggest that tuberculin testing in an urban school setting may identify a significant number of candidates for TB preventive therapy, particularly among tenth grade students and those who are foreign-born.\r"

Paired serum specimens, from patients lacking the serologic criteria for diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), were tested. A four-fold increase in E. canis-IFA antibody was found in 16/144 (11 percent) of these paired serum samples. Patients with serologic evidence of E. canis infection had a mean age of 34 years, 69 percent were male, and 63 percent lived in a town less than 10,000 population. Signs and symptoms included: fever 94 percent, headache 94 percent, fatigue 94 percent, anorexia 81 percent, nausea 60 percent, and rash 44 percent. When compared to control patients, whose sera were submitted for RMSF testing but did not meet serologic criteria for RMSF or E. canis, case-patients were more likely to have had leukopenia (OR = 4.9, 95 percent Cl = 1.2, 19.0) and tick exposure (OR = 9.5, 95 percent Cl = 1.4, 62.7). The results suggest E. canis, or a closely related agent, is a cause of human illness. Ticks are probable vector.\r"

While the experience of family planners, particularly in those countries most threatened by heterosexual HIV transmission, has shown that the most effective measures of pregnancy prevention have relied on women, little attention has been given to barriers to HIV transmission that depend on the woman and are under her control. Tactics which interrupt transmission of the virus should be considered in their own right and separated from those that interrupt pregnancy, for insurance, the diaphragm. Greater emphasis is urged for research on preventive methods women could use, including the possibility of a topical virucide that might block transmission through the vaginal route.\r"

A higher number of cases were detected during hot and humid months (April--July). Nineteen children less than 5 years of age (index cases) and their 71 family members were followed for 3 weeks after the release of the index cases from the hospital. Diarrhea continued for greater than 14 days (persistent diarrhea) in 8 (32%) index children. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 1 (12.5%) of 8 family members who developed diarrhea during the follow-up period. Index cases excreted oocysts for 3-28 days (12.37 +/- 8.35 days). Almost all the patients recovered with oral rehydration.

Parasite specific serodiagnostic ELISA systems for onchocerciasis and dracunculiasis were devised based on these findings. Phosphate buffered saline extracts of adult worms were passed through a column of monoclonal antibodies to phosphorylcholine (PC). Crude and PC-depleted extracts were reacted on ELISA plates with individual sera from subjects infected with a range of nematodes. Binding of total antibody (Ig) or IgG class antibody and IgG4 subclass antibody was revealed using goat antihuman-Ig-phosphatase conjugate, or appropriate mouse monoclonal antihuman-Ig-type-specific reagents, followed by goat antimouse-Ig-phosphatase conjugate. Specificity of ELISA was improved by restricting reaction to the host's IgG4 antibody subclass, and/or by removing PC determinants from crude antigens. In parallel immunoelectroblots, crude and PC-depleted extracts probed with pooled sera showed potentially useful diagnostic antigens, including a 12 kDa protein from D. medinensis and 14, 18, and 27 kDa proteins from O. volvulus. Two Onchocerca specific ELISA systems non-reactive with antibodies to D. medinensis were devised.\r"

  ".W": "The impact of mass treatment with ivermectin on the intensity of Onchocerca volvulus transmission by the black fly (Simulium yahense) was evaluated on the Liberian Agricultural Company rubber plantation in Liberia, West Africa. The adult pre-treatment prevalence of onchocerciasis was greater than 80%, and the average intensity of infection was 5.35 mf/mg of skin. The drug was administered at 2 annual intervals, reaching 58-60% of the approximately 14,000 people living in 73 camps. Landing/biting catches of black flies made in central and peripheral plantation zones indicated similar fly activity before and after ivermectin treatment (man hr index of 2.1 and 2.4 within the plantation, and 10 and 10.9 outside the plantation, respectively). The number of infected flies with developing larvae (L1, L2, L3 stages) of O. volvulus in treated areas was reduced by 93.4-95%; the number of infective flies with L3 larvae was reduced by 81.7-89.3%. Parasite loads of infected (L1, L2) and infective flies (L3 stages only) outside the plantation also decreased by 86.8% and 80%, respectively. Monthly transmission potential (MTP) showed a similar decrease: from 22.9 to 5.8 (74.6% reduction) in the treated area, and from 210 to 158.8 (24.4% reduction) in untreated areas. Mass treatment with ivermectin efficiently controlled, and at least temporarily interrupted, transmission of Onchocerca volvulus by black fly vectors.\r"

Spirochetes were detected in the blood through 30 days, in the brain through 60 days, and persisted in the spleen, liver, kidneys and articular tissue through 360 days. Acute exudative arthritis, tendonitis, and bursitis were evident in multiple joints by day 30. Arthritis regressed thereafter but capsular fibrosis and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates persisted throughout the study. Several rats developed exacerbations of acute arthritis within days 180-360, a pattern similar to that encountered in human Lyme disease. Rats had a high prevalence of nonsuppurative myocarditis and vasculitis during days 90-360. Spirochetes were visualized by microscopy in joints and other tissues during the first month of infection, but were seen only sporadically thereafter. All rats seroconverted to B. burgdorferi by day 30. IgM titers persisted and IgG titers rose progressively through day 360. Immunoblots revealed IgM reactivity to a single 41 kDa protein until 360 days, when reactivity to a 60 kDa protein emerged. IgG reactivity occurred against progressively more proteins with time, indicating continued antigenic stimulation. Chronic and recurrent arthritic lesions and myocardial involvement suggest that the rat is a reliable model for further investigation.\r"

The latter was associated with cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). To study viral risk factors for DHF/DSS, a retrospective seroepidemiological survey was conducted in Cerro, a densely populated district in Havana City. The prevalence of plaque reduction neutralizing antibodies to DEN-1 and DEN-2 viruses was measured in 1,295 individuals (children and adults). Of these, 43.7% were immune to DEN-1 virus and 23.6% to DEN-2 virus. Of those individuals who were immune, 26.1% were immune to DEN-1 virus only, 6% to DEN-2 virus only, and 17.6% to both viruses. The DEN-2 virus infection rate in DEN-1 immune individuals was 3.8 times higher than in non-immune individuals. The 5 DHF/DSS cases in the sample had evidence of DEN-1 virus plus DEN-2 virus infections. Three were children and 2 were young adults. No cases were found in individuals infected with DEN-1 virus or DEN-2 virus only. Children infected by DEN-1 virus followed by DEN-2 virus had a high risk of acquiring DHF/DSS. Blacks and whites were equally infected with DEN-1 and DEN-2 viruses.\r"

We investigated the interaction of human neutrophils with Naegleria trophozoites and examined the effect of neutrophil stimulation by the recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on this interaction. As indicated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, TNF stimulated the adherence of neutrophils to N. fowleri with destruction of the ameba. Neutrophil iodination, an indirect measure of stimulation, increased from 0.81 +/- 0.23 nmol/10(7) cells/hr to 2.41 +/- 0.62 nmol/10(7) cells/hr following the addition of TNF to the neutrophil-N. fowleri mixture (P less than 0.05). This was independent of complement or specific immunoglobulin. Ingestion of neutrophils by Naegleria trophozoites was observed following more prolonged incubation, particularly in the absence of TNF. These findings suggest a role for TNF-mediated destruction of Naegleria trophozoites by neutrophils in host defense, and that ingestion of host neutrophils by Naegleria trophozoites may represent a virulence factor.\r"

The 25% Strongyloides infection rate is one of the highest prevalences recorded in southern Africa. The Trichuris infections in the Kaudom group appeared to be autochthonous, and this population did not harbor Strongyloides. Regular contact with pans in summer and boreholes at any time probably facilitated the acquisition of infections in wet and fecally polluted sites.

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of 3 monospecific antivenoms were compared in patients envenomed by the Malayan pit viper, Calloselasma rhodostoma. There was a biphasic decline in serum concentrations following intravenous administration. The initial rapid decline was attributable to the formation of venom-antivenom complexes, as the fall in antivenom during this phase was positively correlated with the initial venom concentration (P = 0.045). The total apparent volume of distribution for each antivenom was 1.5-3 times larger than that of the central compartment, which suggests some tissue distribution in addition to complex formation. This was marked for antivenom from the Government Pharmaceutical Organization of Thailand which contained mostly F(ab)2 fragments. The terminal elimination half time was shorter for Twyford antivenom of caprine origin. Systemic clearance was lower for Thai Red Cross antivenom. In 8 of the 26 patients who experienced recurrence of non-clotting blood after initial response to antivenom, serial measurements of plasma venom and antivenom concentrations revealed that recurrence of venom antigenemia and non-clotting blood bore no direct relation to the elimination half-life of the antivenom used, but non-clotting blood recurred when serum antivenom levels fell below 10-20% of the total given. There is no substitute for close monitoring of envenomed patients so that indications for further antivenom can be detected promptly.\r"

The mean prevalence of antibody to vesicular stomatitis Indiana (VS IN) virus was 15.2%, but was significantly higher in 1 herd. A total of 25 cases (annual incidence rate of 9%) of clinical vesicular stomatitis (VS) was reported. VS NJ virus was identified as the causal agent by detection of VS NJ virus antigens by the complement fixation test. VS NJ virus was isolated in 11 cases. All episodes of disease occurred between November and January, the beginning of the dry season. Most animals maintained stable neutralizing antibody titers throughout the study, and all diseased animals were previously seropositive to VS NJ virus. A total of 31 animals with neutralizing antibodies to VS NJ virus had a VS NJ virus-specific IgM response, and 6 animals had IgM responses that persisted for as long as 6 months. There was no relation between IgM responses and clinical disease occurrence. VS NJ virus persisted predominantly as a subclinical infection in cattle throughout the year in enzootic areas of Costa Rica. The humoral response did not prevent reinfection with VS NJ virus.\r"

No venous thromboembolism occurred in any of the 542 patients without a risk factor, whereas 12 of 177 patients (7%) with at least 1 risk factor had a venous thromboembolism. Pneumatic compression hose was the most common form of prophylaxis used, but it could not be applied to 35% of limbs because of plaster immobilizers, external fixators, complex wounds, or traction. In the high-risk group, 25 patients (14%) received no prophylaxis because of a physical impediment to application of these hose and a contraindication to anticoagulation. Age greater than 45 years was the only risk factor predictive of venous thromboembolism by logistic regression analysis. Patients with more than one risk factor had a significantly higher incidence of venous thromboembolism than those with only one risk factor. We conclude that a selected subgroup of trauma patients appears to be at risk of venous thromboembolism and should receive prophylaxis. Approximately one in seven high-risk patients cannot receive anticoagulant or mechanical prophylaxis because of their injuries.\r"

Three of these were late arrivals (by transfer or self-imposed delay) and died of protracted hemorrhage. Only three deaths occurring in the Emergency Department itself were found to have been potentially preventable. The important factors in maximizing survival of trauma patients remain rapid transport; immediate, appropriate, rapid evaluation; and quick diagnosis, resuscitation, and definitive therapy. These require a well-trained emergency medical ambulance service delivering patients quickly to a hospital designed to handle trauma patients. One person, preferably a general surgeon with trauma experience, should supervise and monitor the patient continually until the resuscitation phase and all diagnostic tests are completed and definitive therapy is initiated.\r"

  ".W": "Intestinal motility, absorption, and secretion are altered after intestinal obstruction, but at what point the normal bacterial barrier function of the viable gut fails after intestinal obstruction is unclear. Thus, we tested whether after simple intestinal obstruction bacteria would translocate across the viable intestinal wall to cause systemic infection. Within 6 hours of intestinal ligation 1 cm proximal or distal to the ileocecal valve, bacteria had translocated to the mesenteric lymph nodes, and by 24 hours after intestinal obstruction, bacteria had spread to the liver, spleen, and blood stream. Bacterial translocation rarely occurred in the animals undergoing laparotomy and sham intestinal ligation, indicating that bacterial translocation was not due to surgical stress. Based on the results of these studies, bacterial translocation induced by intestinal obstruction appears to be due to disruption of the ecology of the normal gut microflora, leading to intestinal overgrowth with certain enteric bacilli and mucosal damage. Although the exact mechanism(s) by which simple mechanical obstruction injures the intestine is not known, the fact that mucosal injury did not occur in germ-free mice suggests that bacteria may play a role in the pathogenesis of obstruction-induced intestinal injury.\r"

Enterocolitis developed in seven patients (54%): two at diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease; three after colostomy; and two after pull-through. Five children died (38%): one from enterocolitis, two from cardiorespiratory failure after recovery from enterocolitis, and two from end-stage cardiac disease. Children with trisomy 21 can safely undergo definitive operation for Hirschsprung's disease but are at high risk for developing enterocolitis and complications of associated cardiac disease.\r"

Hepaticoenterostomy was performed with transhepatic insertion of a T tube following an original technique. A portion of the horizontal limb of the T tube is placed in the left hepatic duct, the other portion in the duodenum or jejunum, and the vertical limb extends into the right hepatic duct and the right lobe of the liver and is brought out through the abdominal wall. This tube is irrigated daily and removed after 12 months in order to keep the stent in place for a sufficient duration to prevent stenosis. This technique was used in 45 patients who underwent operations from 1954 to 1984. There were 6 postoperative deaths. Of the 39 patients discharged from the hospital, 37 were followed up. Excellent results were obtained in 30 patients who remained asymptomatic after observation from 1 to 14 years. In three patients, results were good, but there were occasional episodes of fever that subsided with antibiotics; one of these patients was observed for 17 years. Results were poor in four patients who developed a recurrent stenosis; three of them underwent reoperations, with satisfactory results. Long-term observation has shown that the described surgical procedure is useful in cases of high stenosis of the hepatic duct, because a stent can be left in place for a year and usually will prevent stenosis at the biliary intestinal anastomosis.\r"

These vessels coursed upward behind the posterior parietal peritoneum. The anterior and posterior walls of the remnant stomach were stained blue after injection of methylene blue solution into the splenic artery. The surgical importance of the posterior gastric artery is obvious because of its high frequency and deep origin and course.

SSOM appeared to be a more precise measurement instrument than TM and far more sensitive to the detection of clinical improvement. The study documents the significant contribution of a nurse-educator to the evaluation process, as this contribution correlates well with TM yet provides a unique and independent perspective. Finally, SSOM of evaluation correlated significantly with oral examination and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) test results. Addition of SSOM to TM is recommended for clerkship evaluation of ward performance.\r"

The instrument was compared, in a series of 30 patients in whom a total of 150 readings were taken, in respect of accuracy, ease and speed of use, and acceptability to patients, with the Perkins hand-held applanation tonometer. There was good correlation between measurements obtained with the two instruments: r = 0.92, (p less than 0.001); the Pulsair was described as easy to use in 87% of subjects, and no patient found the procedure unpleasant. The median times taken for Pulsair measurements were 7 (range 4-14) seconds for a single reading in conscious patients, and 11 (range 4-29) seconds for four readings in anaesthetised patients. These times were significantly quicker than those recorded with the Perkins tonometer which were 83 (range 66-138) seconds and 20 (range 8-45) seconds respectively (p less than 0.001). We conclude that the Pulsair is suitable for use by those who are not ophthalmologists for the rapid measurement of intra-ocular pressure changes during anaesthesia.\r"

Evaluation was by anaesthetists and by visual analogue scoring by the patients. The anaesthetists found that patients who received metoprolol were significantly less anxious (p less than 0.005) and better sedated (p less than 0.001) before induction of anaesthesia. The patients who received metoprolol found themselves more calm compared with placebo patients. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were reduced by metoprolol compared to placebo. Metoprolol may be a valuable drug for premedication.\r"

Each technique was supplemented by spraying lignocaine through the fibrescope and intravenous fentanyl-droperidol sedation. Inhaled nebulisation was successfully used for 96% (46 of 48) of patients, was safe, effective and acceptable to the patient and bronchoscopist. The cricothyroid injection method produced better conditions than nebulisation in patients who had diagnostic bronchoscopy. The nebuliser technique is as satisfactory as the spraying technique in patients for diagnostic bronchial lavage in whom bleeding from a cricothyroid puncture is unacceptable. Patients who used the nebuliser were more satisfied. This technique may also be a useful method for 'awake' intubation.\r"

The local anaesthetic used comprised a mixture of lignocaine 0.5% with adrenaline 1:200,000; the dose of lignocaine administered varied from 3.8 mg/kg to 4.9 mg/kg. Plasma adrenaline increased by 326% and plasma noradrenaline by 75% at 10 minutes after completion of the block. Mean heart rate increased from 75 to 94 beats/minute after 20 minutes, whilst there were no obvious changes in systolic and diastolic arterial pressures. Potentially serious arrhythmias developed in two patients, thought to be related to the peak plasma concentrations of adrenaline produced. It is recommended that the dose of adrenaline used as described for this block should be reduced.\r"
