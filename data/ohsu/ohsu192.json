  ".W": "The authors studied the relationship between lateral cerebral ventricular size and regional cerebral blood flow during mental activation in 30 patients with schizophrenia. Patients with large ventricles had diffusely lower cortical gray matter blood flow than patients with small ventricles. In addition, an inverse correlation between ventricular size and prefrontal blood flow was observed while patients were attempting to solve a neuropsychological test specifically related to the prefrontal cortex. These data suggest that structural brain pathology impairs prefrontal physiology in schizophrenia, implicating a neural mechanism for the intellectual deficits characteristic of this disorder.\r"

This report describes 23 largely chronic DSM-III schizophrenic patients who, after a period of inpatient treatment, sustained good outcome without maintenance antipsychotic medication over an average of 15 years. Retrospective study of these patients revealed that their distinguishing characteristics at admission included better premorbid social and occupational adjustment, higher levels of accrued psychosocial competence and acquired skills, fewer hebephrenic traits, and the preservation of affect (depressed mood). Hence, even within a largely chronic patient sample, classic predictors of good outcome may also be useful in predicting sustained remission without medication.\r"

Patients with dementia or depression were found to have lower CSF somatostatin concentrations than control subjects despite markedly different clinical presentations. Severity of depression was clearly different in all three groups but showed no significant correlation with CSF concentration of somatostatin. There was a significant positive correlation between CSF somatostatin-like immunoreactivity and cognitive functioning in all 47 subjects, but this association was not statistically significant within individual diagnostic groups. These data raise interesting questions about possible biological links between Alzheimer's disease and depression in older patients.\r"

The mean basal cortisol level of the patients with panic disorder was significantly higher than that of the normal control subjects but almost identical to that of the depressed patients. Only three of the patients with panic disorder had abnormal DST results. These results indicate that patients with panic disorder have an abnormality of at least one function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system which overlaps the abnormality in major depressive disorder.\r"

In the present survey, no treatment was regarded as critical by a majority of psychiatrists for any of the five anxiety and somatoform disorders studied. The authors conclude that because neurotic disorders form an important part of the workload of psychiatrists, consensus procedures should be used to develop guidelines for treatment until the research literature can provide more adequate guidance.\r"

Limitation of SI units deemed suitable for use in reporting clinical laboratory results stems from recommendations put forth by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. Limitations are: 1) the liter as sole recommended unit of volume in concentration measurement; 2) substance concentration (unit mole) favored over mass concentration (submultiples of the kilogram); and 3) discouraging the use of the prefixes hecto-, deca-, deci-, and centi-. Further discussion by the American Medical Association and other organizations is required before consensus in the US medical community can be reached as to extent of and time frame for conversion to SI for reporting clinical laboratory measurements.\r"

To examine ways to improve the delivery of these basic services, we evaluated well child clinics and mass vaccination campaigns under operational conditions in a rural area of Nicaragua. We found that mass vaccination campaigns using volunteers reached 77.1 per cent of the population under age six. At stationary well child clinics in which villages were invited to a health center and a small food ration was used as an incentive, attendance improved to 94.1 per cent. Similar attendance levels (99.2 per cent) were attained by mobile well child clinics also using a food incentive. Attendance at stationary clinics decreased with the distance of the village from the health center. However, stationary clinics took up only half as much health workers' time as mobile clinics. Our results suggest that stationary clinics employing food as an incentive could be used for villages or neighborhoods close to a health center while mobile clinics offering food should be reserved for more isolated villages.\r"

The model contains a demographic-epidemiologic (DE) submodel, which stimulates the distribution of coronary risk factors and the conditional incidence of CHD in a demographically evolving population; a \"bridge\" submodel, which determines the outcome of the initial CHD event; and a disease history (DH) submodel, which simulates subsequent events in persons with a previous CHD event. The user of the model may simulate the effects of interventions, either preventive (i.e., risk factor modification) or therapeutic, upon mortality, morbidity, and cost for up to a 30-year period. If there were no future changes in risk factors or the efficacy of therapies after 1980, baseline projections indicate that the aging of the population, and especially the maturation of the post-World War II baby-boom generation, would increase CHD prevalence and annual incidence, mortality, and costs by about 40-50 per cent by the year 2010. Unprecedented reductions in risk factors would be required to offset these demographic effects on the absolute incidence of CHD. The specific forecasts could be inaccurate, however, as a consequence of erroneous assumptions or misestimated baseline data, and the model awaits validation based on actual future data.\r"

The study population was at high risk for unintended pregnancy and STDs; at time of interview 46 per cent of women were not contracepting and 59 per cent were treated for STD or STD exposure. Two-thirds of women had at least one prior pregnancy and 50 per cent had at least one living child. Only 26 per cent of women knew that some contraceptive methods may reduce the risk of STD acquisition; however, 62 per cent expressed interest in contraceptive methods which would reduce their risk of STD acquisition. This study suggests that provision of contraceptive services in STD clinic settings may address dual needs in a group at high risk for both unintended pregnancy and STD.\r"

Thiocyanate provided the poorest discrimination. Carbon monoxide measured as blood carboxyhaemoglobin or in expired air gave sensitivity and specificity of about 90 per cent. Sensitivities of the tests were little affected by the presence among the claimed nonsmokers of a group of 21 \"deceivers\" who concealed their smoking. It is concluded that cotinine is the measure of choice, but for most clinical applications carbon monoxide provides an acceptable degree of discrimination and is considerably cheaper and simpler to apply.\r"

In three regions, population-based data were obtained from the 12 hospitals which provided all surgical care to discrete populations. The overall rate of surgical operations per 100,000 population was 124, 1.5 per cent to 9 per cent of the rate in western countries. The ratio of surgeons per 100,000 population was 0.36, 1/80 the ratio in the United States. There were almost twice as many operations per surgeon as in the USA. These data indicate a severe shortage of surgeons in Pakistan's district hospitals. They also provide the spectrum and relative numbers of different operations performed at the district level. This information has been useful along with other factors in designing a surgical curriculum at the Aga Khan University in Karachi, Pakistan.\r"

The reconstructed knees had a significantly greater total AP laxity (3.8 +/- 0.6 mm) (mean and SEM) than the controls (1.0 +/- 0.1 mm). Differences in primary AP laxity were responsible for 81% of the difference in total laxity, with only a 0.4 mm difference in secondary laxity. Neutral stiffness in the reconstructive knee was 17% of control, while stiffness at 30 newtons (N) of anterior force was approximately 50% of controls. Ligament stiffness in the linear region for the ACL allograft was 35% of the control value of 686 N/mm. The maximum load of the allografts was 571 +/- 45 N, or 25% of the contralateral ACL control strength (2301 +/- 155 N). Five of the seven allografts failed at the femoral insertion. Both elongation (83%) and energy (21%) to maximum load were less for allografts than controls. Histologic evaluation of the allografts revealed the presence of a regular oriented dense connective tissue which resembled a normal ligament. Microangiography revealed a periligamentous and endoligamentous vascular pattern reminiscent of a normal ACL and complete revascularization of the bone plugs.\r"

  ".W": "Sir Robert Jones, in 1902, described a transverse fracture of the proximal diaphysis of the fifth metatarsal, which he treated conservatively with good results. Since that time, classification into acute and chronic categories by several authors has been proposed and most agree with the relatively high incidence of non-union. Controversy exists concerning operative versus nonoperative primary treatment especially in athletes. The purpose of this study was to determine if nonoperative treatment could be used effectively in treating these fractures. A retrospective study of nine patients with 10 Jones' fractures was completed. The cases were categorized as acute or chronic by clinical history and radiographic appearance. The average age was 23.6 years. There were eight males and one female. In this group, competitive athletes sustained chronic fractures, while acute fractures occurred in nonathletes. Treatment consisted of a short leg nonweightbearing cast until radiographic and clinical healing occurred, followed by 6 weeks of limited activity. Mean clinical and radiographic union of chronic fractures was 9.4 weeks; acute fractures, 22 weeks. All competitive athletes returned to their preinjury level of competition at an average of 12 weeks following initiation of treatment. There was one refracture. Our data indicate that nonoperative treatment of early chronic or subacute fractures without intramedullary sclerosis can compare favorably with surgical treatment procedures reported in other studies in returning athletes to play postinjury. We suggest serious consideration be given to the method herein as a form of primary treatment of the early chronic Jones' fracture without intramedullary sclerosis.\r"

Involvement of the tendon itself is secondary to areas of mucinoid or fibrotic degeneration, or may be a result of a partial rupture. The sheath (or mesotenon) may also become chronically inflammed. Retrocalcaneal bursitis seems to be a separate entity with hypertrophy and fibrosis of the bursa usually occurring in conjunction with a prominent posterior superior angle of the os calcis. The vast majority of patients can be successfully treated nonoperatively; however, there is a group of patients who are refractory to nonoperative management who would like to continue running, particularly if they are competitive. A retrospective review of 45 surgical cases in 37 patients was performed. All but two of these patients were competitive long-distance runners. There were 24 cases of Achilles tendinitis and/or tenosynovitis, 14 cases with retrocalcaneal bursitis, and 7 with a combination of both. Mean followup was 3 years (range, 1 1/2 to 8 years). Overall there were 87% satisfactory results. Ninety-two percent of the patients with involvement with the tendon and/or sheath had a satisfactory outcome as compared with 71% of patients with retrocalcaneal bursitis. Passive dorsiflexion in the 29 unilateral cases improved from a mean of 17 degrees preoperatively to a mean of 25 degrees postoperatively. We feel that surgery offers a solution for highly motivated runners with chronic posterior heel pain who would like to continue running when conservative measures have failed.\r"

To reduce the incidence of knee sprains and strains, the most common injuries to this population, the following preventive recommendations are presented: 1) optimum maintenance of playing fields; 2) use of the soccer-style shoe; 3) noncontact and controlled activities in practice sessions; and 4) increased vigilance over technique during injury-prone preseason practices. The authors conclude that more research into factors such as exposure time and activity at injury will further reduce the risk to the high school football player.\r"

Subjective evaluation of function was obtained by questionnaire. At arthroscopy, meniscal lesions were seen in 37 of 51 knees, and degenerative changes were noted in 24 knees. The ACL was absent in 43 knees. Partial meniscectomy or suturing was performed on 20 patients. All patients had an average of 3 weeks of supervised physical therapy stressing hamstring strengthening. At followup, thigh girth measurements of injured and normal legs found thigh wasting in 40 patients. Seven of 33 patients radiographed showed evidence of degenerative changes. About two-thirds of the patients returned to some level of athletics and had no problems with activities of daily living. Twenty were able to return to pivoting sports, but only five could return to their preinjury levels of competition. Of the 18 patients who did not return to athletics, only 8 were considering or had had a ligament reconstruction. Those patients who chose to continue rehabilitation beyond the prescribed period and who modified their activities had a better functional outcome.\r"

The results were then compared with our experience with the proplast ligament used in a previous clinical series. This prospective review evaluated the patients preoperatively and at regular intervals during the postoperative period. The average followup was 24 months postoperation. Eighty-three percent of the patients had a satisfactory result, scoring greater than 140 points on a 200 point knee grading scale. Objectively, the anterior instability pattern was improved in 87% of the knees. Subjectively, pain of at least a mild degree persisted in 70% of the patients postoperatively. This pain seemed to correlate with articular cartilage changes documented intraoperatively. Major complications occurred in two patients. In conclusion, the PTFE prosthetic ligament was an improvement over the proplast ligament in the reconstruction of the multiply operated, unstable knee. The 83% satisfactory rate with the PTFE was promising compared to a 52% satisfactory rate using the proplast ligament. However, we encourage future long term studies of the PTFE prosthetic ligament in the reconstruction of the ACL in the chronically unstable knee.\r"

  ".W": "Infrapatellar Contracture Syndrome (IPCS) is an infrequently recognized cause of posttraumatic knee morbidity. Unique to this group of patients is the combination of restricted knee extension and flexion associated with patella entrapment. IPCS can occur primarily as an exaggerated pathologic fibrous hyperplasia of the anterior soft tissues of the knee beyond that associated with normal healing. It can also occur secondarily to prolonged immobility and lack of extension associated with knee surgery, particularly intraarticular ACL reconstruction. IPCS follows a predictable natural history which is divided into three stages. Symptoms, diagnostic findings, and recommended treatment are determined by the stage at presentation. Once beyond its early presentation, IPCS is best treated by an anterior intraarticular and extraarticular capsular debridement and release, followed by extensive rehabilitation. The authors review 28 consecutive cases of IPCS. At followup 3 months to 4 years postoperation, the patients had averaged 2.3 additional surgical procedures following their index procedure or injury. The average increase in extension at followup was 12 degrees with the average increase flexion 35 degrees. Eighty percent of patients demonstrated signs and symptoms consistent with patellofemoral arthrosis; 16% of the patients demonstrated patella infera. The authors conclude that prevention or early detection and aggressive treatment are the only ways of avoiding complication in these problem cases.\r"

  ".W": "Knee and hip problems account for up to 40% of injuries in classical ballet. Despite apparent flexibility, many dancers appeared to have tight iliotibial bands that contributed to lower limb problems. Thirty senior female ballet dancers were contrasted with thirty age-matched active volunteers for hip and knee range of motion, and the information derived was correlated with their orthopaedic medical histories. Dancers spent a reasonable period of time warming up, but it was usually with an unbalanced routine that emphasized hip abduction and external rotation to the exclusion of adduction work. This was reflected in the significantly lower range of passive hip adduction and internal rotation compared to the controls. Furthermore, the older and more experienced the dancer, the more this trend was exaggerated. This unbalanced flexibility may play a role in the production of lateral knee pain (30% of the dancers) and anterior hip pain (33% of the dancers). It is suggested that more attention should be given to a balanced stretching regimen as part of the dancers' warmup in an effort to reduce the frequency of some of the chronic hip and knee complaints.\r"

  ".W": "Endocrine responses in seven power athletes were investigated during a 12 week strength training period, when the athletes were taking high doses of androgenic-anabolic steroids, and during the 13 weeks following drug withdrawal. During the use of steroids significant decreases (P less than 0.05 to 0.001) in the serum concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, triidothyronine, free thyroxine, and thyroid hormone-binding globulin (TBG) were found, whereas the value of triidothyronine uptake increased (P less than 0.001). In relation to the changes in the thyroid function parameters measured, we suggest that the primary target of androgen action was TBG biosynthesis. In five of the seven subjects, serum concentrations of growth hormone increased at some point of the study 5 to 60-fold. Because of the use of exogenous testosterone, serum testosterone concentration tended to increase. This increase was associated with a corresponding increase (P less than 0.001) in serum estradiol. Furthermore, there were major decreases in serum LH (P less than 0.01) and FSH (P less than 0.01) concentrations, and testicular testosterone production was therefore decreased. This was characterized by a very low serum testosterone concentration (5.1 +/- 1.8 nmol/l) 4 weeks following drug withdrawal. Cessation of drug use resulted in return of all the variables measured to the initial values, except for serum testosterone, which was at a low level (14.6 +/- 8.8 nmol/l) 9 weeks after drug withdrawal, indicating prolonged impairment of testicular endocrine function. No consistent changes were found in the eight control athletes.\r"

Postoperatively, complete paralysis of the musculocutaneous nerve was noted in six cases and incomplete paralysis in one case. Two patients had complete axillary nerve palsies. There were two cases of partial paralysis of the radial, median, and ulnar nerves, respectively. Seven of the patients underwent brachial plexus exploration an average of 16 weeks following their initial operation (range, 4 to 40). Suture material was removed from around or within two musculocutaneous nerves and one ulnar, one median, and one axillary nerve. Two lacerated musculocutaneous nerves were amenable to delayed primary repair. Two musculocutaneous, one median and one axillary nerve required grafting. Injury to the brachial plexus was associated with inadequate knowledge of regional anatomy, blind clamping of axillary artery lacerations, use of axillary incisions which limited exposure, and failure to identify the musculocutaneous nerve during Bristow procedures. If a brachial plexus injury occurs during a Putti-Platt or a Bristow procedure and the lesion does not rapidly, progressively, and completely recover, the brachial plexus should be explored since there is a high likelihood of structural neurologic injury.\r"

An extensive cross-reactivity with sera from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease also was observed. Two polypeptides (Mr 119,000 and 123,000) reacted with all the sera from visceral leishmaniasis patients. When they were electroeluted from gels and evaluated with respect to specificity to the L. donovani chagasi subspecies, these components were expressed in all strains of Leishmania tested, but not in those of Trypanosoma cruzi. These results indicated that these components are shared by Trypanosomatidae of genus Leishmania. The eluted polypeptides did not react with sera from patients with Chagas' disease, indicating the feasibility of using purified antigens to discriminate between the humoral immune responses in T. cruzi and Leishmania infections.\r"

Follow-up examination of these children showed a high rate of reinfection, with 29.6% excreting cysts during the year following treatment. During the same period 13.3% of previously uninfected children had started passing cysts, while over half of infected, but untreated, children had undergone apparent \"self-cure.\" Younger children were more likely to be reinfected than older children, and continued excreting cysts for a longer period of time.\r"

Such transmission was enhanced if the females had taken a bloodmeal 2 to 7 days prior to mating. Male Ae. albopictus also transmitted dengue virus vertically to their F1 progeny. Infected progeny were found among those derived from eggs laid greater than or equal to 73 hr after mating but not among those derived from eggs laid prior to that time. This suggests that virus probably was not transmitted directly to ova but, rather, underwent prior replication in the female genital tract. Female Ae. albopictus experimentally infected with dengue type 1 virus did not transmit their infection sexually to males. This finding supports the hypothesis that male mosquitoes naturally infected with dengue virus acquired their infection vertically.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of Rift Valley fever (RVF) viral infection on the survival of female Culex pipiens was examined. In 3 experiments in which mosquitoes ingested RVF virus, there was a 44% decrease in survival to days 14-16 for transmitting vs. nontransmitting mosquitoes, and a 48% decrease in survival for individuals with disseminated vs. nondisseminated infections. These results were corroborated by other experiments in which survival of mosquitoes intrathoracically inoculated with RVF virus was compared with that of those inoculated with diluent. In both the per os and inoculation tests, uninfected mosquitoes survived significantly longer than infected mosquitoes. Even though mosquitoes with disseminated infections had a lower survival rate than did uninfected mosquitoes, dissemination and transmission rates were similar at days 7 and 14-18 after the infectious bloodmeal. This suggests that nondisseminated individuals were developing disseminated infections and becoming capable of transmitting virus between days 7 and 14-18 at approximately the same rate older transmitters were dying. The decreased survival associated with RVF viral infection should be considered in predictive models of this disease.\r"

Eighty-seven percent of the tumors occurred in the parotid tail. The rest were in the deep lobe, or in an extraparotid location. Fifteen patients had multifocal tumors. The maximum number of tumor foci in one patient was six. A significant increase in the female incidence was noted with a 1.5:1 male-to-female ratio as compared with the previous male dominant ratio of 8:1. Eighty-two percent of the female patients in our group were smokers. We correlated a very high incidence of cigarette smoking in our series when compared with age-matched groups in both sexes within the general population. Since it is estimated that one of eight patients with Warthin's tumor will have multifocal disease, we suggest wider exposure and more meticulous operative exploration to avoid overlooked synchronous tumor foci and subsequent recurrence.\r"

A detailed analysis of the 26 patients who underwent craniofacial resection for tumors invading the anterior fossa cribriform plate region has been presented. Histologic studies revealed epithelial tumors in 18 patients, sarcoma in 6 patients, melanoma in one patient, and ossifying fibroma in one patient. The median survival in this group of patients was 60 months. Survival was influenced by histologic diagnosis. Malignant tumors involving the base of the skull can be successfully resected using a craniofacial approach with minimum morbidity and acceptable operative mortality as demonstrated in this experience. Unfavorable prognostic factors included massive intracranial extension, high grade tumor, and previous treatment failure.\r"

We observed one such patient, then instituted a prospective study. We observed a 58 percent incidence of apparently diminished parathyroid reserve among 53 patients given high doses of I 131. Susceptibility does not appear to be related to age, sex, extent of thyroid operation, operative technique, the amount of thyroidal I 131 uptake, the use of external radiation to the neck, or to the presence of parathyroid glands or of Hashimoto's disease in the operative specimen; however, susceptibility may be related to the anatomic location of the parathyroid glands in relation to the thyroid gland. The administered dose of I 131 almost reached significant levels (p = 0.1) in the present study. The initial pretreatment serum calcium levels were consistently lower among affected patients (p = 0.01), suggesting the presence of a preexisting latent impairment of parathyroid reserve which was subsequently unmasked after the administration of I 131. Thyroid cancer is compatible with very long-term survival, and therefore, there is a considerable risk of delayed chronic hypocalcemia among patients who have received large doses of I 131, particularly female patients in the premenopausal age group. These patients deserve special management surveillance.\r"

The resultant hypopharyngeal defects were reconstructed with gastric transposition, a tubed pectoralis major myocutaneous flap, and a pectoralis major flap patch, respectively. There were three hospital deaths in the gastric transposition group (6 percent) and none in both pectoralis major flap groups. The leakage rate was 8.3 percent in the gastric transposition group, 25 percent in the tubed pectoralis major flap group, and 3.7 percent in the pectoralis major flap patch group. Stricture was avoided with the interdigitation technique used at the tubed-flap-to-esophagus anastomosis, although the fistula rate was high. The overall complication rate was higher with gastric transposition. Although swallowing was satisfactory in all three groups, 42 percent of the patients with gastric transposition experienced regurgitation. Over a follow-up period of 16 to 50 months the local recurrence rate was 5 percent, and the actuarial survival rate was 55 percent at 24 months.\r"

Fibrocartilaginous callus formed in the first week. Beginning in the second week, this was gradually replaced by bony callus, a process which started from the medullary cavity of the bone end. The cut end of the original cartilage showed no activity. The periosteum and perichondrium became continuous at 4 weeks. The site of ossification assumed the appearance of the original costochondral junction. The gap between the original cartilage and the new cartilage disappeared when fusion occurred at 48 weeks. Osteochondral junctions at various periods after operation were subjected to disruption force until the junctions were pulled apart. The average force required to break 16 junctions was 2,738 g, and was not related to the period of healing.\r"

Seventy-nine of these patients had cancer. There were 13 operative failures (13.5 percent) in 10 patients. Failures were attributed to arterial thrombosis in four instances, venous anastomotic problems in four instances, fistula and infection in the neck in one instance, carotid blowout in one instance, psychosis with avulsion in one instance, and an unknown cause in two instances. Seven second attempts at salvage of jejunal flaps were performed with five successes. There were five deaths in the perioperative period (6 percent). Of these, one was directly attributed to graft failure. The following eight abdominal complications required operation: wound dehiscence (four instances), small bowel obstruction (one instance), Mallory-Weiss tear (one instance), gastrostomy tube leak (one instance), and acute gastric dilatation (one instance). Complications in the neck included infection (six instances), infection requiring operation (three instances), hematoma (three instances), and suture line dehiscence (one instance). Fistulas developed in 28 patients (32 percent), 12 of whom required operative closure (43 percent). Significant stenosis developed in six patients, two of whom required operative revision. Of 79 patients treated for cancer, 34 died from progression of disease which recurred an average of 9.7 months postoperatively. Death ensued an average of 16.7 months postoperatively. Ten patients died with no evidence of disease. At last follow-up, 28 patients were alive without apparent disease. Twenty-six of these patients have good swallowing function. Significant palliation and a high rate of restoration of function are possible with the free jejunal autograft. Careful patient selection should markedly decrease operative morbidity and mortality.\r"

This technique permits separation of the oronasopharynyx from the intracranial contents, coverage of dural grafts, restoration of composite tissue loss, and achievement of superior aesthetic results in a single stage. When choosing vascular anastomotic sites, free-flap transfer permits a greater latitude in flap orientation, tailoring, and inset than is possible when using fixed pedicled rotation flaps. When confronted with a deeply invasive or gigantic malignancy, a multidisciplinary team approach is optimal. The risk associated with sophisticated ablative and reconstructive operative procedures is justified when dealing with potentially curable lesions. The success of these extensive procedures is related not only to the functional result and the aesthetic appearance, but most importantly to the resultant quality of life they allow.\r"

Multivariate analysis revealed that only thickness was an independent variable (p less than 0.0001). Patients with tumors less than 6 mm in thickness had a significantly better survival rate compared with those patients with tumors greater than 6 mm in thickness, regardless of the tumor stage.

Over a 10 year period, we performed rim mandibulectomy to treat oral cavity malignancies with mandibular involvement. This retrospective analysis of 38 patients comparing rim mandibulectomy with the traditional segmental mandibulectomy has demonstrated equivalent local control rates between rim mandibulectomy and segmental resection (75 and 64 percent, respectively). Patients with rim mandibulectomies were more satisfied with their postoperative appearance, and some were able to wear lower dentures if well motivated. In performing the rim mandibulectomy, we found that smooth, curved osteotomies without step-offs resulted in a technically simple operation that was biomechanically sound and had a low complication rate. Rim mandibulectomy, because it is based on sound pathologic principles and does not disrupt the mandibular arch, is an operation that adequately resects the tumor without compromising the cancer operation or the patient.\r"

  ".W": "Of the 3,907 cases of primary head and neck or lung cancer diagnosed between 1961 and 1984, 94 patients were identified with a history of cancer at both sites. The total incidence of lung cancer in our head and neck cancer patients was 5.4 percent. Of the 94 patients, 73 had both cancers diagnosed at our institution. These 73 patients were further analyzed. Squamous cell carcinoma accounted for 63 percent of the lung cancers. Twenty of the lung cancers were synchronous and 47 were metachronous after head and neck cancer. Of the synchronous lung cancers, 50 percent were postoperative stage I, whereas only 11 percent of the metachronous cancers were postoperative stage I. The lung cancer survival rate was significantly better for the synchronous cancer group at 5 years (34 percent) than for the metachronous cancer group (5 percent). The better survival rate was evidently due to the greater proportion of early-stage lung lesions. The relatively large number of advanced-stage lung lesions in the metachronous cancer group suggests that aggressive screening of head and neck cancer patients for lung cancer may detect more metachronous lung cancers at an earlier stage and thus improve the survival rate of these patients.\r"

All patients were staged prior to definitive treatment and were autopsied. The overall incidence of distant metastases was 47 percent. The hypopharynx had the highest incidence of distant metastases (60 percent), followed by the base of the tongue (53 percent) and the anterior tongue (50 percent). Of the 387 patients with distant metastases, 91 percent died with uncontrolled tumor either at the primary site or in the neck. The lung was the most common site of distant metastases (80 percent), followed by the mediastinal nodes (34 percent), the liver (31 percent), and bone (31 percent). Overall, 6 percent of the patients had stage I disease, 20 percent had stage II disease, 32 percent had stage III disease, and 43 percent had stage IV disease. The highest incidence of distant metastases was found in those patients with stage IV disease (193 of 350 patients, 55 percent). We believe that the initial stage of disease does appear to be related to the ultimate development of the distant metastases.\r"

  ".W": "Initial manifestations of AIDS in the head and neck area occur frequently. In fact, up to 40 percent of patients may have involvement of the head and neck. The most common malignancies are Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Since AIDS-related malignancies are a relatively new problem for radiation oncologists, optimal therapy for these neoplasms is unknown. A retrospective review of AIDS patients treated with radiotherapy has been performed. Fourteen patients were identified. Of these, five were treated for head and neck tumors (four for Kaposi's sarcoma and one for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). Epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma, as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, were seen to be as radioresponsive as the classical forms, but local control was difficult to achieve. Kaposi's sarcoma tended to recur marginally and within the field. Nonetheless, we believe radiotherapy can offer significant palliation for AIDS patients with head and neck tumors. It is of utmost importance that the head and neck surgeon must be acutely aware of the common patterns of presentation of this disease.\r"

  ".U": "88021550\r", 
  ".W": "From 1956 to 1978, 646 patients were treated with radiotherapy for carcinoma of the nose (350 patients, 54 percent), eyelids (159 patients, 25 percent), pinna (93 patients, 14 percent), and skin adjacent to the lip (44 patients, 7 percent). The histologic distribution was 72 percent basal cell carcinoma, 18 percent squamous cell carcinoma, and 10 percent mixed basal and squamous cell features. Tumors less than 2 cm in diameter were found in 602 patients (93 percent), whereas 44 patients (7 percent) had larger tumors. Tumor involvement of cartilage and bone was seen in 23 patients at the time of diagnosis. The 5, 10, and 20 year control rates were 99 percent, 98 percent, and 98 percent, respectively, for 502 tumors less than 2 cm in diameter. This compared favorably with control rates of 92 percent at 5 years and 79 percent at 10 years for tumors from 2 to 5 cm in diameter and 60 percent at 5 years and 53 percent at 8 years for 12 patients with massive tumors (p less than 0.0001). The histologic characteristics of the lesion had a strong influence on tumor control (p less than 0.02). Of the patients with cartilage or bone invasion, tumor was controlled in 19 (83 percent). Of these 19 patients, 11 had no evidence of disease for 3 years or more. Of all 646 patients treated, failure was seen in 60 (9 percent). It correlated well with the size of the lesion, being 7 percent for tumors of less than 2 cm and 50 percent for tumors of greater than 5 cm. Of the 60 patients in whom treatment failed, 48 (80 percent) had prior definitive therapy. Radiotherapy was an efficient modality to control operative failures; however, it was not as efficient at control in patients in whom previous radiotherapy failed. Operation was the treatment of choice to salvage patients in whom radiotherapy failed. Of the patients in whom retreatment failed, 10 were known to have died from skin cancer, and an additional 6 patients were presumed to have died from the cancer. This study has demonstrated a good control rate and good cosmetic results for small tumors of the eyelids, pinna, and nose. In addition, a good control rate was obtained in patients with cartilage and bone involvement. Treatment of massive tumors should involve planned operative resection with adjuvant radiotherapy.\r"

Inevitably, there are limitations to its usefulness but it has the advantage that no special apparatus is required for its performance. The implications of this test are discussed in relation to difficult intubation, obstetric anaesthesia, the teaching of applied anatomy and checking by their trainers of intubations performed by very junior anaesthetists. Familiarity with this test should be considered essential for its reliable implementation.\r"

For equivalent degrees of depression of psychomotor function, lormetazepam depressed the laryngeal reflex less than Diazemuls (p = 0.004). Lormetazepam give over 60 seconds depressed the laryngeal reflex more than when given over 10 seconds (p = 0.008) or over 20 seconds (p = 0.048), although a significant difference was not demonstrated between the 10-second and 20-second groups. These results concur with experimental evidence that benzodiazepine receptor multiplicity exists, which allows various members of the benzodiazepine group of drugs to exhibit differing therapeutic ratios for their various effects.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of sufentanil were studied in 28 pediatric patients undergoing cardiovascular procedures. Patients were divided into four groups on the basis of age: neonates (0-1 month, n = 9), infants (1-24 months, n = 7), children (2-12 yr, n = 7), and adolescents (12-18 yr, n = 5). Sufentanil 10-15 micrograms/kg, was administered by IV bolus and plasma concentrations measured for up to 20 hr. A tri-exponential equation best described the time-concentration data in all patients. Clearance rate (Cl) was 6.7 +/- 6.1 ml.kg-1.min-1 (+/- SD) in neonates, which was significantly lower than the values of 18.1 +/- 2.7, 16.9 +/- 3.2, and 13.1 +/- 3.6 ml.kg-1 min-1 observed in infants, children, and adolescents, respectively. The volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) was 4.15 +/- 1.0 L/kg in neonates, significantly greater than the values of 2.73 +/- 0.5 and 2.75 +/- 0.5 L/kg observed in children and adolescents, respectively. The elimination half-life (T1/2 beta) was 783 +/- 346 min in neonates, significantly longer than the values of 214 +/- 41, 140 +/- 30, and 209 +/- 23 min observed in infants, children, and adolescents, respectively. The plasma concentration of sufentanil at the time of additional anesthetic supplementation to suppress hemodynamic responses to surgical stimulation was 2.51 ng/ml in neonates, significantly higher than the levels of 1.58, 1.53, and 1.56 ng/ml observed in infants, children, and adolescents, respectively. The authors conclude that age-related differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of sufentanil are evident in pediatric patients with major cardiovascular disease who are undergoing cardiovascular surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Because isoflurane has been reported to produce coronary steal, we studied 12 open chest, anesthetized (pentobarbital) dogs with critical stenosis (CS) of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCA). Sonomicrometers were implanted to measure systolic wall thickening, myocardial blood flow (MBF) was measured with microspheres (15 microns diameter), and regional venous sampling was performed to estimate regional oxygen extraction and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). Anesthetic concentrations of isoflurane reduced arterial blood pressure dramatically, resulting in a maldistribution of MBF distal to the CS consistent with the pattern characterizing a transmural coronary steal effect. Elevation of arterial blood pressure with phenylephrine during high concentration isoflurane (1.7 +/- 0.1%) augmented MBF, but the maldistribution distal to the CS persisted. Despite the maldistribution, however, there was no indication of ischemia in the LCA region because systolic wall thickening, oxygen extraction, and MVO2 were not significantly different between the LCA and left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) (control) areas. Because wall thickening, oxygen extraction, and MVO2 were markedly reduced by isoflurane in both the LCA and control areas, it was concluded that isoflurane substantially reduced myocardial oxygen requirements by inducing myocardial depression, reducing heart rate, and decreasing afterload. Consequently, the apparent maldistribution of LCA blood flow (coronary steal) was due to the hemodynamic and vasodilatory effects of isoflurane, but did not result in ischemia because the level of blood flow was at or above the requirements of the myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of nitrous oxide on cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) was examined during a varying background anesthetic state in the New Zealand White rabbit. Seventy percent nitrous oxide resulted in significant and similar increases in CBF during anesthesia with both 0.5 MAC of halothane (44 +/- 14 to 63 +/- 17 ml.100 g-1.min-1) (mean +/- SD) and anesthesia with isoflurane (34 +/- 9 to 41 +/- 11 ml.100 g-1.min-1). During anesthesia with 1.0 MAC halothane or isoflurane, N2O also increased CBF, but the increments (halothane, 73 +/- 34 to 111 +/- 54 ml.100 g-1 min-1; isoflurane 34 +/- 13 to 69 +/- 34 ml.100 g-1.min-1) were significantly greater than those observed at 0.5 MAC. When 0.5 MAC halothane or isoflurane was supplemented with morphine (10 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 2 mg.kg-1.min-1), the CBF effect of N2O was not significantly different from that observed with 0.5 MAC alone. It was concluded that, in the rabbit, the effects of N2O on cortical CBF vary with the background anesthetic state and that the increase in CBF caused by N2O becomes greater as the end-tidal concentration of halothane or isoflurane increases from 0.5 to 1.0 MAC. Morphine, when added to 0.5 MAC of halothane or isoflurane, does not alter the effect of 70% N2O on cortical CBF.\r"

  ".W": "The cardiovascular effects of the administration of nifedipine and nifedipine combined with propranolol were examined in 15 monkeys during 0.75 and 1.25 MAC of anesthesia with isoflurane, enflurane, or halothane. Hemodynamic variables measured included heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), maximum rate of increase of the Left ventricular pressure (max LV dP/dt), and thermodilution cardiac output (CO). The infusion of nifedipine at a rate adequate to produce therapeutic blood levels during 0.75 MAC with each anesthetic decreased MAP and SVR, but had no effect on cardiac index (CI), max LV dP/dt, or HR. Increasing the anesthetic concentration from 0.75 to 1.25 MAC during nifedipine administration decreased HR and MAP in all groups and decreased CI with halothane and enflurane, but not with isoflurane. Addition of propranolol by infusion in amounts adequate to produce 75% beta-adrenergic blockade caused a further depression of CI, max LV dP/dt, HR, and MAP. However, the hemodynamic depression was significantly greater with halothane and enflurane than with isoflurane. Intravenous administration of calcium chloride (10 mg/kg) after calcium channel and beta-adrenergic blockade only partially reversed the hemodynamic depression that occurred with all three anesthetics. It was concluded that acute loading with nifedipine with and without propranolol exerts a greater cardiovascular depressant effect during enflurane or halothane anesthesia than during isoflurane anesthesia. The myocardial depressant effects of nifedipine and propranolol myocardial depressant effects of nifedipine and propranolol may be synergistic with the depressant effects of potent inhalation anesthetics.\r"

In a double-blind, randomized fashion, 90 anesthetized patients received a mean dose of 25 micrograms/kg fentanyl during surgery. Inadequate spontaneous respirations at the end of anesthesia were treated with either naloxone 0.08 mg or nalbuphine 2.5 mg IV every 2 min while heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP), respiratory rate (RR), and tidal volume (TV) were measured at 2-min intervals. Arterial blood samples for analysis of PaCO2, PaO2, and pH were drawn when spontaneous ventilation resumed, and 30 and 60 min later. Narcotic antagonism and respiration were deemed adequate when TV was greater than or equal to 4 ml/kg and RR greater than or equal to 8 breaths/min. Heart rate, SBP, DBP, TV and RR were recorded, as were the occurrence of renarcotization (RR less than 8) and analgesic requirements every 5 min during the recovery room stay. Sixty of 90 patients required narcotic antagonism at the end of surgery. No patient required more than three doses (0.24 mg) of naloxone or four doses (10 mg) of nalbuphine. Both antagonists produced similar and moderate increases in SBP and HR while restoring adequate spontaneous ventilation. There were no significant differences in TV, RR, or arterial blood gases (ABGS) between the two groups after narcotic reversal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The structural similarity of the halothane metabolite, 2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethene (CDE), to haloethenes that are metabolized by and inactivate cytochrome P-450, suggests that CDE may undergo secondary metabolism and degrade these isozymes. This possibility was examined in hepatic microsomes by determining fluoride release and cytochrome P-450 loss due to CDE metabolism in the presence of several anesthetics. CDE alone decreased cytochrome P-450 from phenobarbital-treated rats by as much as 37%, but the addition of isoflurane or halothane to incubations containing CDE increased the loss of cytochrome P-450 nearly twofold. Fluoride release was enhanced approximately 2.5 to 3 times by halothane or isoflurane; however, fluroxene inhibited fluoride release and did not enhance the loss of cytochrome P-450. Extrapolation of these results to the clinical situation suggests that the metabolism of CDE produced during halothane anesthesia and the accompanying cytochrome P-450 loss may contribute to the inhibition of drug metabolism produced by halothane.\r"

These differences were noted despite the fact that patients given LE + HCO3 received no less ephedrine and no more additional anesthetic than controls.

Study 1 (n = 8)--EMAC Reduction: Dezocine reduced EMAC in a dose-dependent fashion by a maximum of 58 +/- 3% (mean +/- SEM) after injection of 20 mg/kg.

Group 2 (n = 5) was studied in exactly the same manner except that instead of dezocine, each dog received drug carrier solution alone (carrier). Significant hemodynamic differences between carrier and drug groups were observed only at the 20 mg/kg dose level, which produced death in one dog and a decrease in mean aortic pressure to 39 +/- 5% of baseline, in cardiac output to 60 +/- 9% of baseline, and in stroke volume to 69 +/- 9% of baseline in the remaining dogs. It is concluded that dezocine produces a dose-dependent reduction in EMAC limited by cardiovascular toxicity. This toxicity appears to be related to direct myocardial depression by high doses of dezocine in the presence of enflurane.\r"

Using the 2-[14C] deoxyglucose method, glucose utilization was measured in the spinal cord and in the brain, including structures related to pain modulation, in the presence and in the absence of analgesia produced by epidural morphine as confirmed by the hot plate test. Glucose utilization was shown to be similar in the spinal cord and in the brain in both groups of animals.

Measurement of mouth opening, induced by a constant test force, was made when each patient was deeply anesthetized, as judged by clinical parameters. Succinylcholine, vecuronium, or pancuronium was then administered. The mouth opening measurement was repeated immediately after the loss of limb muscle twitch response and 45 s following the loss of twitch response. For the 24 patients receiving succinylcholine, there was a significant reduction in mean mouth opening (P less than 0.0001) and a significant increase in jaw stiffness (P less than 0.0001) immediately after limb relaxation. Forty-five seconds after full limb relaxation was attained, the mean mouth opening was still reduced (P less than 0.0001) and the mean jaw stiffness was still increased (P less than 0.0003) in the succinylcholine group. Patients receiving either vecuronium or pancuronium did not show a significant change of mouth opening or jaw stiffness following limb relaxation. Three patients, who received succinylcholine, required several attempts at tracheal intubation due to increased resistance to mouth opening. Anesthesia and surgery proceeded in all patients. None of the patients developed malignant hyperthermia. In view of the fact that a reduction in mouth opening was a constant finding when succinylcholine was administered during halothane anesthesia, the assumption that isolated \"masseter spasm\" or jaw stiffness heralds malignant hyperthermia should be reconsidered.\r"

Baroreflex control of heart rate was assessed by a pressor test using phenylephrine. Plasma concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography, and plasma droperidol concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay, from blood samples withdrawn before baroreflex evaluation. All data were obtained before and 5, 10, and 15 min following droperidol administration. Baroreflex response was significantly decreased after droperidol at each time of the study with the maximal decrease (-47% from control) observed at 5 min. No resetting of baroreflex was present since the pulse interval at the reference pressure was unchanged. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations were moderately but significantly increased only at 5 min, while no significant change in epinephrine concentrations was observed. It is concluded that droperidol induces a moderate but sustained alteration of baroreflex function and a transient increase in plasma norepinephrine concentrations.\r"

Single and repetitive stimulation was applied to rabbit cervical sympathetic and vagus nerves exposed to solutions containing lidocaine 0, 0.3, or 0.6 mmol/l (9.1 or 18.2 mg/dl) at 37 degrees C. Unit responses were recorded in dissected filaments or extracellularly in the vagus nodose ganglion. With lidocaine 0.3 mM, equilibrium conduction block, tested by single shocks, was rare. 40-Hz trains produced a significantly greater increase in latency (slowing of conduction) and a much greater incidence of UDB in the sympathetic units than in myelinated vagus axons of equivalent control conduction velocities or in unmyelinated axons. 10-Hz stimulation did not produce UDB. With lidocaine 0.6 mM, the incidence of equilibrium conduction block was too high among sympathetic axons to assess UDB, and significantly higher than among nonsympathetic myelinated and unmyelinated units. The observations support the hypothesis that the differential block of sympathetics observed clinically with spinal anesthesia may be, at least in part, a use-dependent (frequency-dependent) effect. UDB seems unlikely to contribute to local anesthetic block of pain impulses.\r"

Thirty healthy surgical patients were given an initial 0.1 mg/kg bolus of vecuronium, followed by an infusion of vecuronium at an initial rate of 1.0 microgram . kg-1 . min-1. After 1 h of steady-state 90% twitch depression, plasma vecuronium concentrations (Css90) were measured by capillary column gas chromatography. Total plasma clearance of vecuronium was estimated using Css90 values. Vecuronium infusion rates (mean +/- SD) were similar for patients given enflurane (0.28 +/- 0.13 microgram . kg-1 . min-1) and isoflurane (0.30 +/- 0.13 microgram . kg-1 . min-1), but significantly higher in patients given fentanyl (0.92 +/- 0.37 microgram . kg-1 . min-1). Values for Css90 in the patients receiving enflurane and isoflurane were similar (71 +/- 34 and 72 +/- 44 ng/ml, respectively), but significantly higher in those receiving fentanyl (165 +/- 48 ng/ml). Total plasma clearance was similar during enflurane, isoflurane, and fentanyl anesthesia (4.4 +/- 2.6, 4.6 +/- 1.2, and 5.6 +/- 1.9 ml X kg-1 min-1, respectively). The authors conclude that patients receiving isoflurane and enflurane require markedly lower vecuronium infusion rates to achieve 90% neuromuscular blockade than those receiving fentanyl. The enhancement of neuromuscular blockade by isoflurane and enflurane represents a change in the pharmacodynamics of vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade, rather than a change in pharmacokinetics.\r"

  ".W": "The authors sought to determine if isoflurane would attenuate effects of three different types of vasoconstrictors on isolated segments of canine epicardial coronary arteries removed from healthy dogs. As the endothelium has a major role in regulating epicardial coronary artery tone, and as it modulates the effect of many vasoactive substances, experiments were conducted both on normal rings and on rings whose endothelium had been mechanically removed. In addition, the endothelium is thought to be damaged in human atherosclerosis. Rings were suspected in organ chambers filled with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution, aerated with 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide, and connected to strain gauges for the measurement of isometric tension. Isoflurane 2.3% (1.5 MAC in the dog) was added to the aerating gas mixture in half the preparations, while the other rings served as control. The vasoconstrictors serotonin, phenylephrine, or prostaglandin F2 alpha were added in increasing concentrations to the bath solution. In the presence of endothelium, vasoconstrictor evoked contractions were attenuated by isoflurane. Maximal tension generated by prostaglandin F2 alpha in untreated rings was 114 +/- 18% (mean +/- SEM) of a reference contraction, while, following isoflurane, it was 46 +/- 8% (P less than 0.005). In the absence of endothelium, isoflurane attenuated neither prostaglandin F2 alpha nor serotonin evoked contraction, and had decreased effectiveness against phenylephrine mediated contraction (P less than 0.001). It is concluded that isoflurane attenuates vasoconstrictor-evoked contraction of isolated canine epicardial coronary arteries, and that this effect is mediated by the endothelium.\r"

Group 1 (n = 8) received SUF in progressively increasing infusion rates from 0.005 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1 to a maximum of 1.215 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1. MAC was determined at stable SUF concentrations in plasma [SUF] during each infusion rate. Group 2 (n = 10) received SUF at a dose rate (0.007 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1) designed to produce approximately 35% MAC reduction, and MAC determinations were made at regular intervals over a mean infusion time of 7.6 +/- 0.43 h (mean +/- SEM). Group 3 (n = 7) received 1.215 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1 and were studied as in group 2 over an infusion time of 6.7 +/- 0.42 h. In group 1, the highest infusion rate (1.215 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1) produced [SUF] = 48 ng/ml and reduced MAC by 71 +/- 6%. This was not statistically different from the reduction which occurred at [SUF] = 0.92 ng/ml (57 +/- 7%; infusion rate 0.015 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1; P = 0.21). In group 2, the degree of MAC reduction achieved by stable [SUF] (0.54 +/- 0.08 ng/ml) declined over time (MAC reduction at start = 34 +/- 2% versus 18 +/- 4.0% at the end of the infusion; P = 0.001), suggesting the development of tolerance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The right lung was ventilated continuously with 100% O2, while the left lung was ventilated with either 100% O2 (\"hyperoxia\") or with an hypoxic gas mixture (\"hypoxia\": end-tidal PO2 = 50.1 +/- 0.1 mmHg). Cardiac output (CO) was altered from a \"normal\" value of 3.10 +/- 0.18 l . min-1 to a \"high\" value of 3.92 +/- 0.16 l . min-1 by opening arteriovenous fistulae which allowed measurements of two points along a pressure-flow line. These four phases of left lung hypoxia or hyperoxia with normal and high cardiac output were repeated in the presence and absence of almitrine. Almitrine bismesylate was administered as a constant infusion of 14.3 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1 for a mean plasma concentration of 219.5 +/- 26.4 ng . ml-1. Relative blood flow to each lung was measured with a differential CO2 excretion (VCO2) method corrected for the Haldane effect. With both lungs hyperoxic, the percent left lung blood flow (%QL-VCO2) was 44 +/- 1%. When the left lung was exposed to hypoxia, the %QL-VCO2 decreased significantly to 22 +/- 1%. However, with the administration of almitrine, the %QL-VCO2 during left lung hypoxia increased significantly to 36 +/- 2%. The arterial oxygen tension decreased significantly between hyperoxia (PaO2 = 633 +/- 6 mmHg) and hypoxia (271 +/- 31 mmHg). With the addition of almitrine, there was no change during hyperoxia; however, during hypoxia, the PaO2 decreased significantly to 124 +/- 15 mmHg. Cardiac output did not influence these findings.

  ".W": "An open circuit tracer gas washout method for measurement of lung volume in patients during anesthesia and intensive care is described and tested. The method employs a device for dispensing the tracer gas, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), a fast SF6 analyzer, a pneumotachograph, and a computer. The dispensing device delivers SF6 into the airway in proportion to instantaneous inspiratory flow so that inspiratory SF6 concentration is held constant, usually at about 0.5%, regardless of the inspiratory flow pattern. The amount of SF6 present in the lungs at the end of a washin is calculated during washout from signals representing expired SF6 concentration and expired flow. From this, lung volume is derived. Accurate and reproducible results were obtained in lung model tests during ventilation with air, N2O in O2, and halothane in O2. Functional residual capacity (FRC) was measured both with SF6 washout and nitrogen washout in five mechanically ventilated patients. This gave the regression equation: FRCSF6 = 10 ml + 1.04 x FRCN2, r = 0.99. A similar close agreement was observed for total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV) measurements in eight healthy, spontaneously breathing subjects: TLCSF6 = 91 ml + 1.01 x TLCN2, r = 0.99; RVSF6 = -32 ml + 0.97 x RVN2, r = 0.95. Comparison with body plethysmography in eight healthy, sitting subjects gave the regression equation: FRCSF6 = 180 ml + 0.96 x FRCbox, r = 0.99. The median (range) for the coefficient of variation at duplicate determinations in 10 anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated adults was 3.0% (0.2-6.6%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After insertion of a radial artery catheter, subjects hyperventilated 3% CO2, 0-5% O2, balance N2. Saturation ScO2, computed on-line from mass spectrometer end-tidal PO2 and PCO2, was used to manually adjust FIO2 breath by breath to obtain a rapid fall to a hypoxic plateau lasting 30-45s, followed by rapid resaturation. Arterial HbO2% (Radiometer OSM-3) sampled near the end of the plateau averaged 55.5 +/- 7.5%. ScO2% (from the mass spectrometer) and SaO2% (from pH and PO2, by Corning 178) differed from HbO2% by + 0.2 +/- 3.6% and 0.4 +/- 2.8%, respectively.

It was found in 15 of the 25 patients with inferior infarction, accompanied by a marked reduction in right ventricular ejection fraction (28 +/- 8%), but was notably alleviated one month later with normalization of right ventricular ejection fraction (39 +/- 7%) and wall motion. These phenomena seem to be specific in right ventricular infarction.\r"

It was observed that levels of these enzymes in the CSF of control subjects were very low but were significantly elevated (p less than 0.001) in both serum and CSF in patients with stroke. The elevation was greater in the CSF than in the serum and was maximum during the first four days of stroke. Thereafter, the enzymatic activity declined. Of all these enzymes, GGTP in CSF correlated best with the clinical picture. It was possible to differentiate between the ischemic and hemorrhagic type of stroke on the basis of CSF levels of GGTP (greater than 60.0 units in hemorrhagic stroke). There was no correlation between GGTP levels in CSF and serum or among GOT, GPT, and GGTP in CSF. It can be concluded, therefore, that estimation of GGTP in CSF is helpful not only in predicting the degree of cerebral damage and functional outcome of the patient following stroke but also in differentiating the type of stroke.\r"

During oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) in a population study the author and co-workers have earlier shown that smokers have higher blood glucose values early postload and lower values at two hours compared with nonsmokers. Eighty-three patients, all with intermittent claudication but with a normal OGTT, have now been studied according to their response to an oral glucose load. The blood flow resistance during reactive hyperemia, as measured with a calf plethysmograph, was compared between subjects in the quartile of patients with the highest forty-five-minute blood glucose and those in the lowest quartile. The blood flow resistance was significantly higher in the group with a high forty-five-minute blood glucose, 13.3 +/- 1.34 vs 9.5 +/- 0.65 (mean +/- SEM), p less than 0.02. Blood pressure and blood lipids were similar in the two groups. It is suggested that an exaggerated early response in the OGTT might be an independent risk factor for peripheral arterial disease.\r"

No substantial improvements have been made, largely because little or no attention has been paid to the underlying physiology. Evidence is presented that these vessels are dilated by virtue of their proximity to small arteriovenous communications. This would explain the response these vessels demonstrate when injected with sclerosing solutions, as well as the relationship between their size and their color, which is documented by objective and subjective measurements. Two novel methods of treating telangiectasias with existing sclerosing solutions are described, and the characteristics of an ideal sclerosant for these vessels are proposed.\r"

  ".W": "Milrinone (M) has been shown to improve left ventricular (LV) performance in animal and human studies. M has strong vasodilator action, and whether increased LV performance is due primarily to vasodilation or to a direct positive inotropic effect is unclear. Ten mongrel dogs were studied. Disopyramide caused a significant and sustained decrease in LV function and was a good model for myocardial depression. At equal reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR), M reversed this LV depression to a significantly greater degree than nitroprusside (NP) did. At equal levels of vasodilation, M produced significantly greater improvement in indices of LV function than NP did in our model of disopyramide-induced LV failure. This suggest that its effect on LV function is not due entirely to afterload reduction, or to reflex sympathetic stimulation, but has a substantial component of direct inotropic stimulation. This study also demonstrated a reversal of disopyramide-induced LV dysfunction by M, which may be clinically useful since, as in many antiarrhythmics, myocardial depression may be a limiting factor in its use.\r"

Multiple coronary lesions were present in 19 patients, and 15 had incomplete revascularization. All patients had RAP done immediately before and after completion of all dilatations, and in 13 patients pre- and post-PTCA exercise treadmill tests (ETT) were also performed. Angina occurred in 16 (70%) patients during pre-PTCA RAP, but in only 4 (17%) after PTCA (p less than .05). The electrocardiogram was positive for ischemia (horizontal or downsloping ST depression greater than or equal to 1 mm) in 18 patients (78%) during pre-PTCA RAP. However, 13 patients (57%) continued to have an ischemic response during post-PTCA RAP (not significant-NS). In 4 patients with multiple coronary lesions who had sequential pacing studies after PTCA of each lesion, the maximum degree of ST depression decreased by 1 mm or more after each dilatation in 3 patients but remained greater than or equal to 1 mm in all. In the 13 patients undergoing both RAP and ETT, angina developed in 7 during pre-PTCA RAP and in 2 after PTCA (p less than .05), compared with 8 and 3 (p less than .05) during pre- and post-PTCA ETT, respectively. Ischemic ST depression occurred in 9 patients during pre-PTCA RAP and in 6 after PTCA (NS), and in 8 and 6 (NS) during pre- and post-PTCA ETT, respectively. Concordance between the two tests was good.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An aortic ejection fraction (AF) was determined. The calculated AEF data were correlated with the presence or absence of AI. The mean AEF from the 17 AI patients was 27.1 +/- 7.2%, while the mean for the non-AI group was 12.0 +/- 6.5% with p less than .001. An AEF of 18% separates the two groups with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 88%, 86%, and 87% respectively. Preliminary data demonstrate a mean reduction in AEF of 12.2 percentage points in 7 AI patients who underwent aortic valve replacement. The AEF may be a useful new parameter to evaluate hemodynamic changes associated with aortic valve replacement in patients with aortic insufficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Cancer was diagnosed in 15 patients among 300 consecutive patients with intermittent claudication. The cancer-associated claudication is characterized by a more accelerated course of claudication, more often requires vascular surgery, and moreover, the lasting relief of claudication depends upon the efficiency of cancer therapy. It is the authors' impression that cancer-associated claudication is predetermined by atherosclerosis and aggravated by cancer through the chronic hypercoagulability state secondary to neoplasm. The clinical picture is characterized by rapid progression, with the frequent necessity of vascular surgery for limb salvage and a higher incidence of graft occlusion. Awareness of this possibility of hidden malignancy may be related to the clinical picture of hemodynamic deterioration of the underlying arterial insufficiency. A high index of suspicion leads to earlier diagnosis of neoplasm. Effective oncologic therapy will often bring the symptomatic relief of ischemic symptoms in the lower extremities. This report indicates that associated neoplasm has a more vicious course of the underlying arterial insufficiency and intermittent claudication.\r"

Standard curves were made for each measurement and the levels of allergen-specific IgG of the sera were expressed in units (U). Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-specific IgG increases from 9 months of age until adulthood. The atopic group showed higher mean values than the non-atopic group (r less than .001). Egg white-specific IgG reaches a peak around 3 to 4 years of age. After this, it declines until adulthood. These results suggest that age factors and allergen factors must be taken into consideration when evaluating allergen-specific IgG antibodies.\r"

The current study evaluated the long-term effects using venom-specific IgG4 determinations. Forty-six patients ranging in age from 3 to 67 years were followed for periods up to 6 1/2 years. All patients included in the study demonstrated Hymenoptera sensitivity on intradermal testing using 0.2 mL of venom extract at concentrations of 0.01 microgram/mL, 0.1 microgram/mL, or 1 microgram/mL. IgE-specific venom antibody levels were tested and found to be elevated. During the first year following institution of venom immunotherapy, 46/46 patients demonstrated an increase in venom-specific IgG4. After the first year of treatment, values reached a plateau. The IgG4 venom-specific antibodies remained relatively constant over the second and third years of the study. Thirty of the 46 patients were followed for more than 3 years. All of the 30, treated greater than 3 years with continuous immunotherapy, demonstrated a gradual decline in IgG4 levels. Despite very low or negligible levels of venom-specific IgG4 antibodies, six patients accidentally stung were still clinically protected. This study suggests that long-term immunity is not mediated in the same manner as that of short-term protection.\r"

The serial immunoglobulin levels including IgG, IgA, IgM showed polyclonal increased immunoglobulin levels during the first month. Only one-fourth of patients had high serum IgE levels. There was no correlation with house dust mite antigen skin test and anti-mite IgE levels. By using the polyethylene glycol and ELISA methods, IgE-circulating immune complexes were detectable in 60% of high serum IgE patients. IgG-circulating immune complexes were also detected in 70% by the polyethylene glycol method and 60% by Raji cell method. CH50 and serum properdin factor B level increased during acute febrile phase. Serial T cell subset studies showed OKT4 cells decreased progressively and OKT8 levels were within normal range during the first and second week. By the third week, OKT4 cells increased and OKT8 cells decreased. This progressed to the fifth week and returned to normal range 2 months later. During the acute febrile phase of the first week, Leu2+15+ cells increased and Leu2+15- cells decreased. After the second week, the Leu2+15+ cells decreased and Leu2+15- cells increased. This increase continued to the fifth week when the Leu2+15+ cells were at the lowest level and the Leu2+15- cells at the higher level corresponding to the OKT8 change. After the fifth week, the Leu2+15+ cells and Leu2+15- cells returned to normal. Patients had increased antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic reaction at the first week of the acute febrile stage. It decreased dramatically in the second week and returned to normal 2 months later.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We conducted a study with three goals: longitudinal determination of demographic and laboratory data characterizing pediatric arrest victims; identification of factor(s) predictive of outcome; and determination of the prevalence of ionized hypocalcemia in pediatric arrest victims. All resuscitation efforts were documented during a one-year period in a 240-bed tertiary care children's hospital. Patients were classified into two groups--respiratory arrest (RA, requiring only assisted ventilation), and cardiac arrest (CA, absence of palpable cardiac activity requiring closed-chest CPR). Collected data and laboratory tests were analyzed using a step-wise discriminant analysis to determine which factors were predictive of outcome. There were 113 arrests in 93 children; 53 were CA victims and 40 were RA victims. CA had a high in-hospital mortality (90.6%) compared to RA (32.5%). The population was young (55% less than 1 year old) and 87% had at least one chronic underlying disease. No laboratory or demographic value was significantly associated with eventual outcome. The number of doses of epinephrine in CA victims, or bicarbonate in RA victims, was associated with eventual outcome. None of 31 CA victims receiving more than two doses of epinephrine survived to discharge. Low ionized calcium concentrations (less than 3.5 mg/dL) were identified in ten patients; septic shock was present in seven, and chronic renal failure in two.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-eight percent of the 60-and-over age group mentioned cardiac disease as their reason for taking the course, compared to only 2.1% for the under-20 age group. To assess recall and actual performance of CPR, a follow-up survey was mailed to all participants six months after the course. Seventy-two percent were still confident in their ability to perform CPR, although no one had performed the technique on a real victim; 61.9% thought there should have been more manikin practice time; 92.2% still had their CPR refresher card. Only 32.3% would perform CPR on a known AIDS patient. This survey provides demographic and personal data that should be considered when planning future large-scale CPR training programs.\r"

Subjects were tested on a recording mannequin immediately after the refresher. Pretest scores were low on almost all skills. After treatment, both groups demonstrated significant improvement (P less than .01), especially on checking the carotid pulse, correct hand position, and ventilation volume. Although students who had watched the tape performed better on compression rate (P less than .05), there was virtually equivalent improvement on the other skills regardless of treatment. Both methods showed promise for reversing skills degradation without mannequin practice.\r"

One infant and 11 pediatric-sized collars were tested on mannequins representing an infant and a 5-year old child. Maximum forces generated by cooperative children were measured, then applied to the mannequins to reproduce head and neck flexion, extension, rotation, and lateral motion. Limitation of motion was measured in each direction for each collar and combination method. In general, collars of rigid plastic construction performed better than did foam types. However, when used alone none of the collars provided acceptable immobilization, with even the best allowing 17 degrees flexion, 19 degrees extension, 4 degrees rotation, and 6 degrees lateral motion. When combined with supplemental devices, immobilization to 3 degrees or less in any direction could be achieved. Findings were verified using cooperative children and selected collars. Overall, combination methods were more effective than cervical collars alone (P less than .001) or supplemental devices alone (P less than .05). The modified half-spine board used with a rigid collar and tape was the most effective combination method. We conclude that prehospital cervical spine stabilization in pediatric patients is best accomplished using a rigid-type cervical collar in combination with supplemental devices as described.\r"

We confirm the SBT as the standard of comparison against which newer prehospital devices can be compared objectively. Of the three devices compared against the SBT, the factory-fabricated short board devices (KED and XP-One) provided the greatest degree of immobilization, in addition to logistical advantages over the SBT.\r"

Seven normal volunteers received phenytoin sodium 15 mg/kg IV with and without activated charcoal. During the charcoal phase, a total dose of 300 g was administered in repeated doses over 48 hours with sufficient sorbitol to produce one to two bowel movements per day. Serum phenytoin concentrations were determined from one to 72 hours after the infusions and were fitted to a one-compartment linear elimination model. The administration of multiple-dose activated charcoal reduced the phenytoin half-life from 44.5 to 22.3 hours. In addition, phenytoin area under the curve was decreased and the elimination rate was increased. Multiple-dose activated charcoal is effective in enhancing the elimination of phenytoin in normal volunteers. Although future studies are needed to determine its role in treating patients with phenytoin toxicity, multiple-dose activated charcoal may provide a readily available, inexpensive therapeutic intervention.\r"

Mice injected with alpha-amanitin and given cimetidine either prophylactically or within six hours showed histologic protection from the hepatic damage seen in control mice. Control animals displayed significant mitochondrial changes when examined by electron-microscopy, while the mitochondria of the cimetidine-treated animals were preserved, suggesting a possible site for toxin action. Further trials will be necessary before treatment of human cases with cimetidine is indicated.\r"

Intramedullary placement usually was performed within 15 seconds. Central venous diazepam samples were collected at one-, three-, six-, ten-, and 20-minute intervals. Intraosseous infusion achieved and maintained serum diazepam levels comparable to those achieved by IV administration. This study was repeated with phenobarbital using a different set of 20 dogs with samples collected at one-, three-, six-, and ten-minute intervals. Results were similar in that the levels were comparable regardless of the use of intraosseous or IV administration. Complications using this technique have been few. When peripheral IV access is unobtainable, intraosseous infusion has been shown to be an effective and efficient alternative for administering medications and fluids.\r"

Patients who were released were offered follow-up within 24 to 72 hours in a hospital-based chest pain clinic. Of these 1,045 patients, 772 (74%) returned or were contacted by phone, and 29 were directly admitted; 14 had unstable angina, and eight had new myocardial infarctions. Because of its positive impact on the quality of care at an acceptable cost, the Chest Pain Clinic, which was originally instituted as part of a research protocol, has now become part of the routine spectrum of care provided at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.\r"

Because iron availability is a prerequisite for lipid peroxidation, this experiment was designed to examine the natural time course of iron release, lipid peroxidation, and cerebral polyunsaturated fatty acid content following a 15-minute cardiac arrest in dogs. Large mongrel dogs were anesthetized with ketamine and halothane and divided into three groups of five each. In two groups, cardiac arrest was induced with KCl. After 15 minutes of cardiac arrest, the dogs were resuscitated by five minutes of internal cardiac massage, epinephrine, bicarbonate, and internal defibrillation. All ten dogs were resuscitated and supported by a standard intensive care protocol until tissue harvest. A 3-g portion of parietal cerebral cortex was obtained from the nonischemic dogs (n = 5), or at two hours (n = 5), or eight hours (n = 5) after resuscitation. Total tissue iron was measured by an atomic emission spectrometer; low molecular weight species (LMWS) iron by the o-phenanthroline test on an ultrafiltered sample; and lipid peroxidation by both the thiobarbituric acid test (TBARS) and determination of the tissue content of lipid double bonds, calculated by first fractionating the lipids by gas-liquid chromatography and then measuring the double bonds in each fraction by spectrometry and summing the results. Univariate ANOVA demonstrated all variables except total tissue iron to have significance at P less than .02. At two hours of reperfusion, LMWS iron and TBARS were significantly elevated above nonischemic control levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Physicians completed a two-part questionnaire outlining diagnosis, diagnostic certainty, suspected drug(s), and management plans immediately following initial evaluation and again at the time of ED disposition. Screen results were reviewed prior to ED disposition in 361 (89%) cases. We found that qualitative drug screens were associated with substantial changes in diagnostic certainty, as measured by changes in probability estimates and changes in absolute mean log-likelihood ratios. In 196 cases for which all data were recorded prospectively, drug screens excluded a diagnosis of drug intoxication or specifically suspected drugs in 81 cases (41%), but identified previously unsuspected drugs in only 21 cases (11%, P less than .001). Management changes followed qualitative drug screen results in 16 of 361 cases overall (4.4%), but seven of these were also associated with diagnostic quantitative serum drug levels. Potentially critical interventions were begun in two cases following positive screens but delayed in another due to a falsely negative screen. Guidelines for more efficient test utilization are proposed.\r"

Eight hundred eighty-one cases met the criteria and were analyzed. Children between 12 and 35 months of age accounted for 43% of the cases and 97% of all exposures were acute. Intentional overdosage accounted for 21%; 76% were accidental in nature. Gastric emptying was performed in 34%. No symptoms were observed in 79% of the cases, which included ingestions of up to 15 g of cimetidine. Only three patients had moderate clinical manifestations. No patients had major medical complications and there were no fatalities. Even patients in the moderate category experienced no life-threatening toxic manifestations. Cimetidine appears to have an extremely high therapeutic index in both children and adults and demonstrates a remarkable safety profile following acute overdose.\r"

Animals were externally cooled to an average of 21.2 C using ice bags. Eight Group 1 and eight Group 2 animals underwent continuous warm saline gastric or closed thoracic cavity lavage, respectively, using afferent and efferent nasogastric and thoracostomy tubes. No animal suffered ventricular fibrillation during tube placement. The closed lavage system consisted of a high-efficiency heat exchanger, a roller pump infusion device, and a heat exchange fluid bath. The lavage fluid circulated at a flow rate of 550 mL/min and a temperature of 39 C. Thoracic lavage animals were followed clinically for 24 hours for evidence of complications, then euthanized and autopsied. The mean time required to rewarm the animals 10 C by central venous temperature probe was 210.9 +/- 18.6 minutes for the gastric group and 99.3 +/- 23.0 minutes for the thoracic group (P less than .001). Rectal temperature consistently lagged behind central venous temperature during both the cooling and rewarming phases in both treatment groups. All of the thoracic lavage animals made an uneventful recovery. Continuous warm saline thoracic cavity lavage for core rewarming of severely hypothermic dogs is more effective than gastric lavage, and appears to be safe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During hemorrhagic shock, decreased perfusion and poor tissue oxygenation lead to increased lactate production. Previous animal studies have suggested that sodium dichloroacetate (DCA), an agent that decreases lactate production, can improve hemodynamics and survival when administered after severe hemorrhage. We used an unanesthetized porcine hemorrhagic shock model to assess the effect of DCA on survival time when administered during fatal hemorrhage. Immature female swine weighing 14 to 20 kg were splenectomized and instrumented with chronic indwelling aortic and right atrial catheters one week prior to hemorrhage. On the day of the experiment, the unanesthetized animals' aortic catheter was connected to a roller pump and blood was removed at a rate of 1.0 mL/kg/min until death occurred. Experimental animals (n = 8) received sodium dichloroacetate (25 mg/mL distilled water) 100 mg/kg IV bolus beginning 15 minutes after the start of hemorrhage followed by a 3 mg/kg/min constant IV infusion. Control animals (n = 8) received an equal volume of normal saline. Arterial pressure, heart rate, blood gases, serum lactate, and serum glucose were measured at baseline and every 15 minutes during hemorrhage. There were no significant differences in survival time (controls, 63 +/- 2.8 min; DCA-treated, 60 +/- 3.7 min), lactate levels, or blood pressures between the two groups. These results suggest that DCA does not decrease serum lactate or improve survival time when administered during ongoing severe hemorrhagic shock. Further study should be directed at the effects of DCA as an adjunctive treatment after hemorrhage has been controlled and tissue perfusion restored.\r"

A prospective observational study was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive properties of spot urine bilirubin and urobilinogen assays in the emergency department as screening test for serum liver function test (LFT) abnormalities. Of 122 patients, abdominal pain was the indication for laboratory evaluation in 54%; jaundice and constitutional symptoms were the indication in 29%. Overall sensitivities for both urine assays were 70% to 74% for serum bilirubin, but 43% to 53% for other LFTs; specificities were 77% to 87% for both urine screens. Positive predictive values show that the urine assays were 83% to 86% reliable for detecting at least one LFT abnormality. Negative predictive values were 85% for both urine assays for serum bilirubin elevations, but lower for other LFTs. Urine urobilinogen has its greatest clinical utility as a screen when a normal/abnormal threshold of 2.0/4.0 mg/dL is used.\r"

  ".W": "A continuous observation time study was used to track 1,568 patients through various stages of emergency department care in order to identify sources of delay. Patients initially were assigned to one of four categories of decreasing acuity, and flow profiles were compared for each category. Patients with lowest acuity level experienced long delays in moving through the ED, although the actual evaluation and treatment time was brief. Urinalyses, procedures, radiographs, and blood tests had an increasing impact on treatment times (45 minutes, 63 minutes, 65 minutes, and 126 minutes, respectively, compared to 31 minutes with no tests or procedures). Patients of increasing acuity moved more quickly, but with a longer evaluation and treatment time. The most critical patients moved most quickly but with a brief evaluation and treatment time due to a rapid disposition from the ED or death. This relationship suggests an emergency care system that is oriented toward the efficient care of high-acuity patients but that is less effective for low-acuity patients. This occurs despite the fact that low-acuity patients comprise the vast majority of the ED census, and represent a group for whom delay is a frequent source of patient dissatisfaction.\r"

In six healthy subjects, significantly less plantar flexion was achieved with the sugar-tong splint than with the other designs. In addition, more force was generated per degree of plantar flexion achieved with the sugar-tong than with the other designs. These results suggest that the sugar-tong splint may be preferred in the acute treatment of ankle injuries based on its greater strength.\r"

Despite a 390-ml (18%) decrease in dead space when breathing took place through the BPCF, there were no significant changes in minute ventilation or respiratory rate. BPCF breathing was also associated with an increase in airways resistance as reflected by a 300-ml (35%) decrease in the FEV1 and a 16% decrease in the FEV1/FVC ratio. The increased resistance resulted in a 20 ml/min (18%) increase in oxygen consumption. Arterial blood gas tensions remained constant. We conclude that although ventilatory efficiency was not improved, this patient was able to satisfy his total minute ventilatory requirements, for the 30-min period, solely through BPCF breathing.\r"

  ".W": "Although the etiology of rheumatoid interstitial lung disease (RILD) remains unknown, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been useful in studying potentially pathogenic mechanisms in this disorder. Previous investigations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and RILD revealed abnormal BAL T-lymphocyte subpopulations and a significant elevation in BAL neutrophils. Because neutrophils have been implicated as important effector cells in inflammatory disorders such as ARDS and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, we evaluated BAL fluid in patients with RA for neutrophil chemotactic and activating properties and for evidence of neutrophil activation. The BAL fluid from patients with RILD contained significant neutrophil chemotactic activity derived from both lipid and nonlipid components. Evidence for neutrophil stimulation in the lower respiratory tract of patients with RILD was suggested by elevations in both myeloperoxidase activity and immunologically determined levels of human neutrophil elastase in BAL fluid. Free uninhibited elastolytic activity, however, was not demonstrated, suggesting that adequate protease inhibitor levels were present to inhibit active elastase activity. In addition to elevated myeloperoxidase activity, a potential role for neutrophil-derived oxidant injury was indirectly suggested by the enhanced release of superoxide anion (O2-) from resting normal human blood neutrophils challenged with concentrated BAL fluid from patients with RA and interstitial lung disease. Significant correlations were found between physiologic parameters and the percentage of BAL neutrophils, as well as levels of neutrophil-derived mediators. For example, levels of human neutrophil elastase were strongly correlated with diminished diffusion capacity (r = -0.73, p less than 0.001) and reduced forced vital capacity (r = -0.63, p less than 0.006).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to determine the roles of increased intrathoracic blood volume and increased vagal tone in the changes in lung volume and nitrogen washout produced by saline infusion. In the first study, measurements of TLC, VC, FRC, ERV, and slope of phase III nitrogen washout (delta N2) were made on 8 subjects before, during, and after inflation of the leg compartments of medical anti-shock trousers (MAST). In the second study, 13 volunteers were infused intravenously with warm saline (30 ml/kg) for 30 min. Repeat measurements were made approximately 20 and 40 min after infusion. Each subject then received intravenously 0.03 mg/kg atropine, and measurements were repeated. In 7 of these subjects, a third study was performed in which the atropine was injected before saline infusion. Inflation of the MAST (see figures 5 and 6) caused a 1.9% decrease in VC, 5.3% decrease in FRC, and no change in delta N2. Saline infusion caused decreases in TLC, VC, and FRC (4.0, 3.1, and 10.1%, respectively) and a 15.0% increase in delta N2. Atropine reversed the change in delta N2 after saline infusion and prevented these changes when given prior to saline. Atropine had no effect on lung volumes whether given before or after saline infusion. We speculate from our data that saline infusion has 2 effects on the lung. One is a simple displacement of air by increased intravascular volume producing the reduction in lung volumes. The second is an increase in small airways resistance that is mediated by vagal reflex and blocked with atropine.\r"

  ".W": "The American Thoracic Society recommends that the largest FEV1 be reported from a set of forced expiratory vital capacity maneuvers performed with maximal expiratory effort. However, increased expiratory effort can decrease the FEV1. When we evaluated the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) in 5 normal subjects, measured from flow-volume curves, as a noninvasive index of expiratory effort, it was positively correlated with indices of effort obtained by using an esophageal balloon. We then measured the difference (dFEV1)between the largest FEV1 and FEV1 from the maneuver with the highest PEFR during 10 test sessions in 10 normal subjects. Thus, dFEV1 was always greater than or equal to 0. The mean dFEV1 was 110 ml for all sessions but decreased to 80 ml when maneuvers with poorly reproducible PEFR or forced expiratory vital capacity values were discarded. We also reviewed 9.471 spirometry sessions from outpatients and found dFEV1 to be greater than 50 ml in 26% of this population and greater than 151 ml in 7%. We concluded that during standard spirometry, FEV1 is inversely dependent on effort. Maximal effort decreases FEV1 because of the effect of thoracic gas compression on lung volume. We recommend that values from spirometry maneuvers that demonstrate submaximal effort, indicated by a decreased PEFR, be discarded. The flow-volume curve display of superimposed efforts facilitates the recognition of submaximal efforts.\r"

The DD50 also was significantly reduced among children with a history of a recent upper respiratory tract illness (URI) (p less than 0.01). There were no significant associations of DD with history of asthma, personal smoking, parental smoking, or respiratory illness during infancy.

  ".W": "We studied the effects of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, milrinone, on isometric force production in the isolated, directly stimulated rat diaphragm. Milrinone (500 micrograms/ml) significantly increased force during twitch stimulation and submaximal tetanic stimulation (p less than 0.05); force during maximal tetanic stimulation was significantly reduced by milrinone (p less than 0.05). The force-augmenting effects of milrinone were not abolished by pretreatment with indomethacin (10(-5)M). Baseline force production decreased when diaphragmatic strips were placed in a calcium-free bathing solution; force potentiation by milrinone, however, persisted in this medium. Pretreatment with milrinone more than doubled the mean time to fatigue (10.8 +/- 1.0 versus 5.1 +/- 0.6 min) during repetitive submaximal stimulation (p less than 0.01). In diaphragmatic strips fatigued by repetitive submaximal stimulation until force production was 60% of baseline, milrinone promptly improved force production; the magnitude of force potentiation after milrinone was quite similar in fresh and fatigued muscle. In conclusion, milrinone enhances diaphragmatic contractility during the most forms of direct stimulation, and delays and reverses diaphragmatic fatigue.\r"

We studied a group of elderly volunteers with nocturnal polysomnography and partitioned them into 2 groups based upon an apnea index of greater than or less than 5 per hour. The results of a protocol evaluating the presence of potential complications of sleep apnea including cardiac arrhythmias, systemic hypertension, cor pulmonale, daytime sleepiness, and cognitive impairment were compared for the 2 groups. No excess incidence of cardiovascular complications was found. Although an increase in daytime sleep tendency was shown for the group with more frequent apneas, no appreciable deficits in cognitive performance were demonstrated. Although apnea during sleep in the elderly may be associated with an increase in daytime sleepiness, it may not necessarily result in other physiologic or neuropsychologic consequences. Therapeutic intervention for these abnormalities should be carefully considered prior to the institution of treatment in light of these observations.\r"

A movement index (MI) and a fragmentation index (FI) during sleep time were computed, giving an estimate of the stability of sleep. In control subjects, we observed a clear differentiation between night and day activity levels. The distribution of MI and FI was very narrow, with a mean +/- SD of 13.9 +/- 5.4 and 16.1 +/- 5.8%. No correlation of MI and FI with body mass index, even in heavily obese subjects, was found; MI and FI decrease significantly with age. A diagnosis of SAS was made by standard all-night polysomnography. Patients with SAS had a significantly higher MI and FI than did control subjects (p less than 0.001). With respect to polysomnographic diagnosis of SAS, the sensitivity of activity recordings was 89%, whereas the specificity was 95%. Five patients were studied after treatment, and decreases in MI and FI at home were in good agreement with the improvement in their sleep as assessed clinically and by polysomnography. We conclude that this technique is useful for an objective measurement of sleep restlessness and fragmentation, and for a simple evaluation of therapeutic effects under real life conditions in SAS.\r"

Elastic recoil measurement, single-breath nitrogen (SBN2) tests, and FEV1 were obtained from 18 lungs with no emphysema and 21 emphysematous lungs with no greater than Grade 5 emphysema score. The mean number of alveolar attachments per brochiole was determined from all the bronchioles cut in cross section. When the 2 groups of lungs were compared, the percentage of predicted elastic recoil of the nonemphysematous lungs was significantly greater at 50, 70, 80, and 90% of TLC than in the mildly emphysematous lungs. The TLC of the emphysematous lungs (% of predicted) was also significantly greater than in the nonemphysematous lungs. Pigment of the small airways was the only pathologic feature that was significantly greater in the emphysematous lungs than in the nonemphysematous lungs. Size distribution in the small airways was similar except for the airways zero to 0.2 mm, which were more frequent in the emphysematous lungs. When data from both groups were combined, elastic recoil was shown to be related to both the number of alveolar attachments (p less than 0.03) and the mean diameter of the small airways (p less than 0.01). We conclude that structural and functional changes in lungs with mild emphysema include reduced elastic recoil, increased lung size, and some size distribution changes in the small airways. Mild emphysema is not associated with air-flow limitation.\r"

Nine patients with severe air-flow obstruction (5 asthma, 4 chronic air-flow obstruction) requiring mechanical ventilation were studied while sedated and therapeutically paralyzed. Pulmonary hyperinflation during steady-state ventilation was quantified by measuring total exhaled volume during 20- to 40-s apnea (end-inspiratory lung volume, VEI). Patients were studied at 3 levels of minute ventilation (VE) (10, 16, and 26 L/min) and at each VE, 3 levels of tidal volume (VT) (0.6, 1.0, and 1.6 L) and 3 levels of inspiratory flow (VI) (40, 70, and 100 L/min for VT = 1.0 L). There were progressive increases in VEI when VT was increased or when expiratory time (TE) was decreased either by an increase in rate (and hence VE) or by a decrease in VI (at a constant VE) reaching lung volumes as high as 3.6 +/- 0.4 L above FRC. Alveolar, central venous, and esophageal pressure rose in parallel with lung volumes, and hypotension was seen in most patients at highest lung volumes. Peak airway pressure (Ppk) was predominantly related to inspiratory flow and did not reflect changes in lung volume. Levels of ventilation required for normocapnia prior to paralysis (15.7 +/- 2.3 L/min) were associated with hypotension in 7 patients and probable hyperinflation in excess of 1.96 +/- 0.17 L above FRC. VEI is a simple, reproducible measurement of pulmonary hyperinflation and may be more important than Ppk in the causation of barotrauma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of bronchoalveolar lavage in the removal of cellular and extracellular components of the lining layer from the lungs of silica-treated and control rats was determined. Exponential functions were fitted to curves generated by plotting the quantity of lining layer constituent removed from the lungs by bronchoalveolar lavage versus the lavage number. From these exponential functions we determined the total amount of constituent available in the pulmonary extracellular lining and hence the efficacy of the lavage procedure in removing materials from the lungs. With control rats the removal of extracellular phospholipids, soluble protein, alkaline phosphatase, and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase by bronchoalveolar lavage occurred at significantly different rates. Removal of 95% of the total available extracellular phospholipid, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, soluble protein, and alkaline phosphatase from the lungs required 4, 4, 8, and 11 lavages, respectively. Removal of 95% of the total available alveolar macrophages required 18 lavages. The influence of pulmonary inflammation on the efficacy of the lavage procedure was investigated by injecting silica dust intratracheally into the lungs of rats (50 mg/200- to 250-g rat) and after 3 days performing the analyses. Silica caused an inflammatory condition in the lungs resulting in the accumulation of materials in the alveoli. Highly significant increases in soluble protein (16-fold), alkaline phosphatase (9-fold), and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (11-fold), polymorphonuclear leukocytes, eosinophils, and lymphocytes were observed. Alveolar macrophages and extracellular phospholipid were not significantly elevated at 3 days after dosing. Silica did not alter the efficacy of the lavage procedure in removing from the lungs any of the extracellular constituents of the lung lining.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Lung fibrosis was experimentally induced in rats by a single intratracheal instillation of 5 mg UICC Canadian chrysotile B fibers. Isolated lung cells were prepared from normal and from asbestos-exposed rats. These cells were also fractionated on bovine serum albumin (BSA) gradients. The contents of serotonin (5-HT), histamine (HIST), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and bombesin (BN) were measured in isolated total cell preparations as well as in density-fractionated cell populations from normal and from asbestos-exposed rats. Analysis of total lung cell preparation showed the presence of heterogeneous populations in normal rat lung. After asbestos exposure, there were significant changes in these cell populations as evidenced by significant increases in lymphocyte and mast cell numbers. In addition, increased levels of 5-HT, HIST, and VIP were observed in isolated lung cells obtained from rats exposed to asbestos 1, 3, and 6 months after instillation. BN content was unchanged 3 months after treatment, but was significantly increased at the 6 month-interval, suggesting a different pattern of response for this neuropeptide. Density fractionation of various cell populations further showed selective changes in specific cell fractions of lung after asbestos exposure. At 6 months, increased levels of 5-HT, HIST, and VIP were associated with cell fraction 7, whereas changes in BN content were found in cell fractions 2 and 3. Similarly, there was a significant increase of mast cells in fraction 7 at the 6-month interval.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fifty guinea pigs were immunized with a mixture of Ascaris suum extract and aluminum hydroxide and then challenged with an inhalation of Ascaris suum extract without anesthesia. Twenty of the 50 guinea pigs showed a dual asthmatic response in which the LAR occurred 3 to 6 h after immediate asthmatic response (IAR). Histologic studies by rapid freezing with liquid nitrogen or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed in 14 of these 20 guinea pigs with LAR and compared with those in 10 of 18 guinea pigs with only IAR, 10 control guinea pigs, and 10 nonimmunized but challenged guinea pigs. Both the percentage and the absolute number of neutrophils in the BAL fluid of the guinea pigs with LAR were significantly greater than those of the control guinea pigs (p less than 0.02) and than those of the nonimmunized but challenged guinea pigs (p less than 0.02). However, that of guinea pigs with LAR was not significantly different from that of guinea pigs with only IAR. On the other hand, histologic examination showed that eosinophil infiltration within the airway walls of the guinea pigs with LAR was more prominent than that of the guinea pigs with only IAR, and showed that there was no significant difference in neutrophil infiltration within the airway walls between the guinea pigs with LAR and the animals with only IAR. Contraction of airway (bronchus, bronchiole) smooth muscle, submucosal edema, and mucus in airway lumen were also observed in LAR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four age- and weight-matched groups of hamsters received intratracheal injections of one of the following in a total volume of 0.5 ml TRIS buffered saline: (1) no additions, (2) 4 units PPE, (3) 135 micrograms lysoPC, or (4) 4 units PPE plus 135 micrograms lysoPC. Thirty minutes later the permeability surface area products (PS) of the alveolar epithelium to 14C-sucrose and 125I-dextran 70 were measured in excised, perfused lungs from some animals from each group. The remaining animals were killed at 6 wk, at which time pressure-volume relationships were measured in excised lungs, and the mean linear intercept was determined from sections of fixed lung tissue. Neither PPE nor lysoPC alone caused statistically significant increases in PS for either tracer. The PPE plus lysoPC caused statistically insignificant increases in sucrose PS but approximate tenfold increases in dextran 70 PS, which were highly significant (p less than 0.001). Although focal air-space enlargement was observed in some lungs 6 wk after exposure to PPE, pressure-volume relationships and mean linear intercepts were not significantly different from control values. Lungs previously exposed to lysoPC were indistinguishable from control lungs for all measurements. Severe emphysema was uniformly observed in animals that received PPE in combination with lysoPC; lysoPC had no demonstrable effect upon PPE-induced hydrolysis of native elastin in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The radial count, an assessment of acinar complexity, was reduced in all cases, and once again the ipsilateral lung was more affected. We present evidence that, in 4 of 6 lungs, volumes were more reduced than predicted from the radial count, and this may be due to loss of (airway) units. We have discussed the controversy about the appearance of the acinus in diaphragmatic hernia and present reasons to explain this. Hyaline membrane disease often occurs in diaphragmatic hernia, even at full term. Intra-alveolar hemorrhage is a common complication of diaphragmatic hernia.\r"

The type of pulmonary edema was based on a clinical classification. The protein content of PEF was not significantly different between CPE (3.89 +/- 0.25 g/dl, mean +/- SEM) and NCPE (4.35 +/- 0.34 g/dl) patients, but the protein content of serum was different (7.18 +/- 0.27 versus 5.13 +/- 0.23, respectively, p less than 0.001). As expected then, the PEF/S ratio was greater in NCPE than in CPE (0.85 +/- 0.06 versus 0.54 +/- 0.03, respectively, p less than 0.05). Thus, differences in the PEF/S ratios in CPE as compared with those in NCPE are independent of mean edema fluid protein content and dependent on differences in serum protein content. PEF and S proteins were separated into 9 fractions of increasing molecular radius by electrophoresis, and fractional concentrations (percent of total protein content) were calculated. The fractional concentrations of these combined fractions of serum proteins were not different between CPE and NCPE. Fractional PEF/S ratios were significantly greater for combined fractions I-III (p less than 0.01) in CPE than in NCPE and significantly less in fractions VII-IX (p less than 0.01). In CPE, a higher percentage of proteins with smaller molecular radii (45 A) enter the airway compartment in part because of higher hydrostatic pressures, whereas in NCPE, larger proteins enter the airways consequent to increased permeability to proteins with molecular radii greater than 72 A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In blood-free perfused isolated rabbit lungs, AA endogenously released or exogenously applied causes an acute pressor response, mediated by metabolites of the cyclooxygenase pathway including thromboxane A2. Moreover, bolus application of AA (final concentration, 100 microM in the recirculating buffer) during an acute hydrostatic challenge was recently noted to cause a rapid, severalfold increase in the capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c), though any significant rise in pulmonary vascular pressure was inhibited by indomethacin. In the present study, we showed that during this mode of AA bolus application in cell-free perfused rabbit lungs, microgram amounts of peptidoleukotrienes (LTE4 greater than LTC4 greater than LTD4) and LTB4 were released into the recirculating buffer within 5 min and continued to be released even after 2 exchanges of the perfusion fluid. In the presence of 2 structurally unrelated lipoxygenase inhibitors (nordihydroguaiaretic acid and AA-861), the leukotriene release was nearly completely inhibited and the AA-induced severe increase in vascular permeability was significantly reduced (2.5- to 3-fold rise in Kf,c, compared to a greater than 10-fold increase in Kf,c in the absence of lipoxygenase inhibition). Exogenous LTC4 caused a dose-dependent, sustained pressure rise in protein-free perfused lungs, apparently mediated via the pulmonary generation of AA cyclooxygenase products. Bolus application of 10 micrograms LTC4 or LTD4 or 7.5 micrograms LTB4 in protein-free perfused lungs during an acute hydrostatic challenge did not, however, mimic the AA bolus-induced severalfold increase in vascular permeability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied 6 normal subjects (Group 1) and 12 stable asthmatics to examine the possible relationship between the refractory period and sympathoadrenal function. The asthmatics were further divided into 2 groups, based on the absence (Group 2, n = 5) or presence (Group 3) of an exercise-induced bronchoconstrictor response. In each subject/patient, after control measurements of spirometry and venous blood sampling, a standard level of treadmill exercise was performed, and blood and spirometry were obtained at 1, 5, 15, and 25 min after the end of exercise.

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. SETTING: Five lipid clinics with a central laboratory and coordinating center. PATIENTS: 101 adult patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were on a lipid-lowering diet throughout the study. After a 4-week placebo baseline period, patients were randomized to five equal treatment groups. Each group received a different sequence of placebo or lovastatin 5 to 40 mg twice daily or 20 to 40 mg once daily in the evening, during three consecutive 6-week periods. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean reductions in total plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol across the dosage ranges were 14% to 34% and 17% to 39%, respectively (p compared with zero and placebo less than 0.01). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoproteins AI and AII rose slightly. Apolipoprotein B fell substantially at the higher dosage levels (-23% at 40 mg twice daily, p less than 0.01), indicating a reduction in the concentration of circulating low-density lipoprotein particles. Maximum response was achieved in 4 to 6 weeks. Twice-daily dosing was slightly more efficient than once-daily dosing. Of those patients receiving 40 mg twice a day, 89% had a fall in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of at least 20%, and 61% had a fall of at least 40%. Adverse effects attributable to lovastatin were minimal, and no patient was withdrawn from the study. CONCLUSION: Lovastatin was well tolerated and effective in the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia.\r"

DESIGN: An open sequential study of serum lipoprotein responses in patients receiving diet alone (mean duration, 4 months); colestipol and niacin with diet (mean duration, 9 months); and colestipol, niacin, and lovastatin with diet (mean duration, 15 months). SETTING: Metabolic ward and lipid clinic of a university medical center. PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients with clinical characteristics of familial hypercholesterolemia (low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, greater than 8.48 mmol/L; 21 of 22 with tendon xanthomas). INTERVENTIONS: Diet: less than 200 mg/d of cholesterol and less than 8% of total calories from saturated fat; colestipol, 30 g/d; lovastatin, 40 to 60 mg/d; and niacin, 1.5 to 7.5 g/d. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean total serum cholesterol and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 4.86 +/- 0.62 mmol/L (188 +/- 24 mg/dL SD) and 2.89 +/- 0.54 mmol/L (112 +/- 21 mg/dL SD), respectively, were significantly lower during ternary-drug treatment than during colestipol-niacin treatment (p less than 0.003) or during treatment in which other possible binary combinations were given. The cholesterol content of very low-density-lipoproteins was lower and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels higher during this phase than during the colestipol-niacin phase. CONCLUSIONS: Colestipol, lovastatin, and niacin are mutually complementary in treating hypercholesterolemia. This regimen produces reductions in serum cholesterol levels similar to those associated with regression of atheromatous plaques in animal studies.\r"

  ".W": "Verapamil was given to 16 consecutive patients with multifocal atrial tachycardia. Intravenous verapamil was administered at a rate of up to 1 mg/min while heart rate and systolic blood pressure were being monitored. The final 5 patients received 1 g of intravenous calcium gluconate 5 minutes before treatment with verapamil; the first 11 received no calcium. The mean +/- SD heart rate decreased by 21% from 129 to 101 beats/min, a difference of 28, 95% confidence interval (CI), 18 to 38 (p less than 0.0005 by t-test), after a mean of 22 +/- 13 minutes from the start of verapamil administration. The mean verapamil dose was 17 +/- 7 mg (6 to 30 mg). Sinus rhythm was restored in 8 patients. Pretreatment with calcium did not block the effect of verapamil on heart rate (27% decrease with calcium compared with 19% decrease without calcium, a difference of 8%, 95% CI, -7 to 23; p = 0.29) but minimized the decrease in systolic pressure (11% decrease with calcium compared with 27% decrease without calcium, a difference of 16%, 95% CI, 7 to 27; p less than 0.01). Verapamil caused transient asymptomatic hypotension in 1 patient. Arterial blood gases were unchanged by verapamil. Thus, verapamil is safe and effective therapy for multifocal atrial tachycardia, consistently slowing the heart rate and often restoring sinus rhythm. Calcium pretreatment may reduce drug-induced hypotension without preventing the antiarrhythmic effect.\r"

SETTING: A university teaching hospital with 500 beds. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 78 patients with symptomatic, sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias that were previously drug-refractory. INTERVENTIONS: Before February 1985, patients received treatment with the defibrillator and amiodarone if they presented with loss of consciousness (group A) and amiodarone alone if they did not lose consciousness (group C). After February 1985, because the availability of the defibrillator was severely curtailed, patients who lost consciousness received treatment with amiodarone alone (group B). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The risk for recurrent arrhythmias was similar between groups. The actuarial risk for sudden death in group B was 31% (95% confidence interval, 11% to 51%) at 1 and 2 years, a value that was significantly higher than that for group A (p less than 0.003) or group C (p less than 0.03). The risk for dying suddenly with the first recurrence was 0.78 in group B, a value that was significantly higher than that for group A (p less than 0.003) or group C (p less than 0.002). CONCLUSION: The defibrillator is highly effective in preventing sudden death in patients whose presenting arrhythmias caused loss of consciousness (group A). In patients whose presenting arrhythmias did not result in loss of consciousness (group C), initial treatment with the defibrillator appears unnecessary.\r"

Experience at the University of Rochester School of Medicine does not corroborate this widespread belief. Among 62 patients with 64 episodes of severe hyponatremia, the mortality rate was only 8%, and most deaths were caused by underlying diseases; with a serum sodium concentration of 105 mmol/L or less, the mortality rate was 5%. Rapid correction of hyponatremia did not account for this favorable prognosis. Only 6% of the 64 cases were corrected to a serum sodium concentration of 120 mmol/L at recommended rates of 1.5 to 2 mmol/(L.h); half of the patients achieved this rate of correction because of a spontaneous water diuresis. In some settings, vigorous therapeutic efforts may have contributed to an adverse outcome. Rapid correction of hyponatremia is not indicated just because the serum sodium concentration is extremely low.\r"

DESIGN: Three uncontrolled phase I trials of increasing duration: 14 days, 8 weeks, and 12 months. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of a university-referral hospital. PATIENTS: All patients were antibody-positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by radioimmunoprecipitation assay, all had recovered from Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and none had Kaposi sarcoma at entry. Nine of ten patients with AIDS had less than 100 CD4+ lymphocytes/mm3 at entry and all patients with the AIDS-related complex had fewer than 200 CD4+ lymphocytes/mm3. Five patients with AIDS and five with the AIDS-related complex entered the 14-day trial. All but two patients with AIDS went on to the 8-week trial, along with seven additional patients with AIDS. Five surviving patients with AIDS and 3 patients with the AIDS-related complex went on to the 1-year study. INTERVENTIONS: Oral ribavirin, 1200 mg twice daily for 3 days was given, followed by 300 mg twice daily for 11 days. During an 8-week trial, a loading dose of oral ribavirin was administered for 3 days, followed by a dose of 300 mg twice daily for 8 weeks. Prolonged regimen of a 3-day loading dose was given, followed by a dose of 300 mg twice daily for 1 year. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ribavirin treatment was well tolerated, with anemia requiring transfusion in one of the ten patients with AIDS receiving the drug for 8 weeks; no other significant toxicity occurred. Six of nine patients initially positive for HIV-1 in blood became negative during ribavirin treatment. Six of nine patients with AIDS had a twofold improvement in lymphoproliferative response to at least one lectin with ribavirin treatment. Mean survival from first episode of P. carinii pneumonia was 17.3 months in patients with AIDS receiving 8 weeks of ribavirin and 21.2 months in patients with AIDS receiving prolonged treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Oral ribavirin, 600 mg daily, was well tolerated and safe in the patients with severe AIDS and the AIDS-related complex. Ribavirin therapy merits extensive evaluation in a multicenter controlled trial to assess its efficacy.\r"

We propose that there is a link between the deferoxamine therapy and this unusual infection. Deferoxamine may serve as a specific growth factor for Rhizopus species or may alter host immune function. We suggest searching for fungal organisms in patients with unexplained illnesses receiving deferoxamine.\r"

  ".W": "Intractable hypercalcemia is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with parathyroid carcinoma. Because gallium nitrate previously was shown to inhibit the bone resorptive activity of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in vitro, we used it to treat two patients with parathyroid carcinoma and resistant hypercalcemia. In both patients, total serum calcium levels were reduced from initial values of 3.62 and 3.77 mmol/L to posttreatment values of 2.32 and 1.45 mmol/L, respectively. Urinary excretion of calcium and hydroxyproline also declined significantly. Serum PTH levels were lower in both patients after therapy, although all levels remained markedly elevated. Nephrogenous cyclic adenosine monophosphate and tubular reabsorption of phosphate remained unchanged. These data indicate that treatment with gallium nitrate can control hypercalcemia in patients with high circulating levels of PTH. Gallium nitrate antagonizes the bone resorptive activity of PTH without altering renal effects of the hormone.\r"

We evaluated data on steroid and platelet-inhibitor therapies and a new clinical strategy, empiric sequential therapy. This sequential approach involves use of short-term alternate-day steroid agents, followed by long-term platelet inhibitors for persistent nephrotic syndrome. Our results indicate that, contrary to usual practice, use of renal biopsy is not necessary in caring for adult patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome; empiric short-term alternate-day steroid therapy is equally efficacious. If the benefits of platelet-inhibitor therapy for treating membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis are confirmed, empiric sequential therapy also will be equally efficacious. Our study shows how decision analysis can be used to identify superfluous diagnostic procedures.\r"

From 4 days to 2 years after disease onset, 28 (51%) had one episode or began to have intermittent attacks of frank arthritis, primarily in large joints; a few had polyarticular movement. The total number of these patients who continued to have recurrences decreased by 10% to 20% each year. The remaining 6 patients (11%) developed chronic synovitis later in the illness; of these, 2 (4%) had erosions, and 1 (2%), permanent joint disability. The spectrum of Lyme arthritis ranges from subjective joint pain, to intermittent attacks of arthritis, to chronic erosive disease.\r"
