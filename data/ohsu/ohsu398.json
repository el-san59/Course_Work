  ".W": "Local hemodynamics were investigated during 33 operations for cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM). In all cases, microvascular Doppler sonography was used to measure flow velocities and vasomotor reactivity to CO2 changes. Intravascular pressure recordings were performed in six patients. The AVM feeders had low intravascular pressure, high flow velocity, low peripheral stream resistance, and very poor vasomotor reactivity. Remote brain arteries showed no abnormalities. Doppler findings in arterial branches of AVM feeders that supplied normal brain indicated arteriolar dilation in their peripheral distribution. On removal of the angiomas, the arteries that formerly supplied them showed a return to normal intravascular pressure, whereas flow velocities dropped far below normal in these vessels. Remote arteries and branches of the former AVM feeders supplying the brain did not show any signs of impaired vasomotor reactivity following angioma removal. The results are in contrast to the normal perfusion pressure breakthrough theory.\r"

  ".W": "Energy expenditure, nitrogen excretion, and serum protein levels were studied from the time of hospital admission until 2 weeks after severe head injury in eight adolescents and four children with peak 24-hour Glasgow Coma Scale scores ranging from 3 to 8. The mean measured energy expenditure (MEE) was 1.3 times Harris and Benedict's predicted value for energy expenditure. Seventy percent of the patients achieved caloric balance (MEE X 1.2) by 4 to 14 days after injury, but balance was not consistently maintained. Five of the 12 patients had intermittent diarrhea, and two had increased gastric residuals. In five patients fluid restrictions were imposed due to either the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, pulmonary complications, or intracranial pressure complications. For the adolescents (aged 11 to 17 years) the mean calorie intake during the 1st week was 752 kcal/day and for the children (aged 2 to 5 years) it was 340 kcal/day. During the 2nd week the mean calorie intake for the adolescents was 1671 kcal/day and for the children was 691 kcal/day. Mean urinary nitrogen excretion was 307 mg/kg/day for the adolescents and 160 mg/kg/day for the children. The calculated mean nitrogen balance for the eight adolescents and the four younger children was -13.6 and -4.1, respectively. Mean albumin levels decreased from 2.9 gm/dl during the 1st week to 2.4 gm/dl during the 2nd week (normal 3.5 to 5.0 gm/dl). Mean total protein level during the 1st week was 5.4 gm/dl and increased to a mean of 6.0 gm/dl during the 2nd week (normal 6.0 to 7.8 gm/dl). Weight loss ranged from 2 to 26 lb during the 2-week period. From these studies it can be concluded that head injury in the child and adolescent induces a metabolic response that includes increased energy expenditure and decreased serum albumin levels similar to those observed for head-injured adults. Mean nitrogen excretion values are less than those in adults with a severe head injury.\r"

To estimate the contribution of pathways independent of AdoMet formation in the oxidation of physiological levels of Met to CO2, the oxidation rates of L-[methyl-14C]Met and L-[methyl-14C] AdoMet were compared in hepatocyte suspensions. Hepatocytes took up AdoMet from the medium and oxidized its methyl group to CO2 at a rate of 280 +/- 22 nmol/g wet cells per hour, which was constant at extracellular concentrations between 0.1 and 1.0 mM AdoMet and Met. Hepatocytes took up L-[methyl-14C]Met and reached an intracellular specific activity within 10 min that was less than 10% of the specific activity in the medium at 0.1 mM Met and 20-30% at 1.0 mM Met. In contrast, L-[methyl-14C]AdoMet formed from L-[methyl-14C]Met reached a specific activity that was 40-50% (0.1 mM Met) and 50-60% (1.0 mM Met) of the specific activity of Met in the medium. These results suggest that AdoMet is formed from a mixture of extracellular and intracellular Met. If the specific activity of AdoMet represents the pool from which Met is oxidized, then the oxidation rates of Met methyl were 1200 and 1859 nmol/(g.h) at 0.1 and 1.0 mM Met, respectively. Thus, oxidation of Met via AdoMet formation accounts for only 12% (at 1 mM Met) to 21% (at 0.1 mM Met) of the total in rat hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

High arginine-requiring (HA) and low arginine-requiring (LA) strains were used, with differences in arginine requirements being due, in part, to differences in renal arginase activity. Arginine requirements were 1.2 and 0.9% for the HA strain and LA strain, respectively. A total of 96 chicks (16 per diet, 48 per strain) were fed a crystalline amino acid diet containing requirement concentrations of arginine and 0.95, 1.40 or 1.85% lysine for 2 wk. Hepatic arginase activity was unaffected by dietary lysine in both strains, whereas hepatic ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity fell with increased dietary lysine in the LA strain only. Increasing dietary lysine significantly increased renal arginase activity but reduced renal ODC activity in the HA strain only. Increasing dietary lysine also caused decreased renal concentrations of arginine, whereas lysine and ornithine concentration increased in both strains. Concentrations of putrescine also rose. It was concluded that excess dietary lysine increased renal concentrations of ornithine due to induction of arginase. This accumulation of polyamine precursors resulted in increased concentrations of putrescine despite feedback inhibition of ODC.\r"

This study was designed to explain the discrepancies. Offspring of dams fed low copper diets (0.5 mg/kg) based on nonfat milk plus sucrose, or casein plus sucrose with and without 30% lactose, were fed the same diets until 8 wk of age. The respective control diets were supplemented with 10 mg copper/kg diet. The low copper offspring were severely deficient as indicated by liver copper levels of approximately 2 mg/kg dry weight, gross signs of enlarged and fragile hearts and neuropathological signs. On average, the dopamine concentrations in the corpus striatum of deficient rats fed milk-based diets were 70% of control values; comparable values for deficient rats fed casein-based diets were 60% of controls. Lactose had no effect on the brain pathology of copper deficiency. Approximately one-half of the deficient animals in all groups displayed low dopamine concentrations (20-50% of control values), whereas the remainder were similar to controls. Norepinephrine concentrations were consistently lower in the total brain, but actually higher in the hypothalamus of copper-deficient rats than in that of controls. Extreme variation in the norepinephrine concentrations was not observed. The high variability in the incidence of low dopamine levels suggests that another condition besides copper deficiency must be imposed to produce severe central nervous system pathology. This could be a genetic or environmental factor.\r"

  ".W": "We used 31P spectroscopy to determine whether administration of a neutralizing dose of bicarbonate in rabbits with lactic acidosis caused a paradoxical brain intracellular acidosis. Ten 10- to 16-day-old rabbits were anesthetized with 0.75% halothane/oxygen and their lungs mechanically ventilated. Metabolic acidosis was induced by decreasing PaO2 to 25 to 35 mm Hg for 1 to 2 hours until the base deficit was 10 to 15 mEq/L. Cerebral ischemia was prevented by maintaining arterial blood pressure at +/- 20% of control value with a venous infusion of epinephrine. Hypoxia was then terminated by administration of 100% oxygen, which was continued for the remainder of the study. After 15 minutes 100% oxygen, 5 mEq/kg 4.2% bicarbonate was administered to five animals; 5 minutes later the same dose was repeated. Control rabbits were given equal volumes of saline solution. In all animals, arterial pH decreased from 7.43 +/- 0.06 to 7.25 +/- 0.08 (SE) during hypoxia, and brain intracellular pH from 7.22 +/- 0.06 to 7.09 +/- 0.09 (SE). Both pH values remained low during reoxygenation. Bicarbonate administration normalized arterial pH (7.41 +/- 0.03), whereas treatment with saline solution did not (7.23 +/- 0.01, P less than 0.05). PaCO2 rapidly increased by 10 mm Hg in the bicarbonate group, and remained elevated; it was unaffected by saline solution administration. Brain intracellular pH in the bicarbonate group increased by 0.12 U over 40 minutes, but intracellular pH in the saline solution group decreased 0.05 pH U (P less than 0.05) over the same period. We conclude that administering a total dose of 10 mEq/kg sodium bicarbonate to neonatal rabbits recovering from hypoxic lactic acidosis increases arterial pH, brain intracellular pH, and PaCO2; it does not produce paradoxical intracellular acidosis in the brain.\r"

Cyclosporine inhibited anti-CD3-mediated expression of IL-2 receptors and IL-2 factor production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM). Cyclosporine did not inhibit when TPA rather than anti-CD3 was used to activate the PBM. Effects of cyclosporine on the activation of memory T cells were also dependent on the stimulus used to activate memory T cells. Cyclosporine inhibited alloantigen associated memory T cell activation, but not when IL-2 provided the necessary triggering signal to memory T cells. IL-2-mediated memory T cell activation was inhibitable with monoclonal antibodies directed at the IL-2 receptor or at the IL-2 factor. Collectively, these findings indicate that the inhibitory activity of cyclosporine is dependent on the activating signals provided to T cells. Moreover, antibodies directed at the IL-2 system together with cyclosporine might prove to be more potent immunosuppressants than either agent alone.\r"

PAF may play a role in glomerular function and disease. Previously the authors reported that glomerular mesangial cells respond to PAF by increasing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis and by cell contraction. This paper examines the specificity of BN52021, SRI 63-072 and kadsurenone on the effects of PAF on cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells. Both BN52021 and SRI 63-072 specifically decreased PAF (1 X 10(-6) M)-stimulated PGE2 production in a dose-dependent fashion (10(-7)-10(-5) M) without affecting the stimulation by angiotensin II (AII) or the calcium ionophore A23187. Kadsurenone also decreased PAF-stimulated PGE2 production, but in a less specific manner, as it also decreased AII- and A23187-stimulated PGE2 production. In order to examine the site of antagonism of PAF-induced PGE2 synthesis by BN52021 and SRI 63-072, the authors prelabeled cells with [14C]arachidonic acid. Both agents diminished the release of [14C]arachidonate from these prelabeled cells in response to PAF in a dose-dependent fashion, though not decreasing release in response to AII or A23187, indicating that they blocked the effect of PAF on phospholipase activation, consistent with receptor blocking activity. BN52021 and SRI 63-072 also inhibited PAF-induced contraction of cultured mesangial cells without an effect on basal tone of the cells or the contractile response to AII.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In pithed rats, neurally mediated chronotropic responses to thoracolumbar stimulation were reduced substantially 1 day after animals were treated with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-HDA), which produced a subtotal destruction of postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals. However, the chronotropic responses of 6-HDA-treated rats recovered to near normal within 1 week despite 90% depletion of cardiac norepinephrine (NE). This recovery of function appeared to depend upon function in surviving sympathetic nerves, and was associated with increased synthesis and release of NE from those neurons as well as diminished inactivation of NE. The gradual development of post-junctional changes, most notably an increase in the density of myocardial beta adrenergic receptors, resulted in enhanced sensitivity to NE and contributed to cardiac function 3 weeks after 6-HDA treatment. In addition, the adrenal medulla increased its synthesis of catecholamines after 6-HDA treatment and thereby contributed to cardiac function, which was especially evident during prolonged sympathoadrenal stimulation. Some of these same adaptations have been observed when rats are subjected to chronic stress, and thus common mechanisms of neuroplasticity may mediate the sympathoadrenal responses to stress and to subtotal injury.\r"

  ".W": "To analyze comprehensively the relevance of the guinea pig trachea as a model of human large and central airways, the contractile effects of the peptidoleukotrienes (LTs), histamine, methacholine and antigen on guinea pig and human airways were compared in vitro. Although some differences were apparent, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, histamine and methacholine had comparable EC50 values and elicited similar maximal responses in both guinea pig trachea and human bronchus (second-seventh generation). In the presence of l-serine borate (45 mM), LTC4 concentration-response curves were shifted significantly to the left in guinea pig trachea but not in human bronchus. Furthermore, the LT receptor antagonists (SK&F 102922 and FPL 55712) had similar potencies against LTC4- and LTD4-induced contractions of human bronchus, whereas, in the guinea pig trachea, they were much more effective antagonists of responses produced by LTD4 than those elicited by LTC4. These results provide further evidence that, unlike in human bronchus, LTC4- and LTD4-induced contractions in the guinea pig trachea are mediated via distinct leukotriene receptors. Ovalbumin-induced contractions of actively sensitized guinea pig tracheae exhibited the same profile as anti-immunoglobulin E-induced contractions of the passively sensitized human bronchus. Furthermore, antigen-induced contractions in both the guinea pig trachea and human bronchus possessed a similar sensitivity to inhibition by mepyramine (10 microM) and the LT antagonists (10 microM), added either alone or in combination. These results indicate that the isolated guinea pig trachea is a suitable model of human large and central airways.\r"

In the isolated guinea pig trachea, SK&F 104353 was a potent, competitive antagonist of leukotriene (LT) D4-induced contractions (pA2 = 8.6). In contrast, SK&F 104353 produced little effect on LTC4 concentration-response curves under conditions where the bioconversion of LTC4 to LTD4 was inhibited. LTE4-induced contractions in guinea pig trachea were sensitive to inhibition by SK&F 104353 (pKB greater than 8.9). SK&F 104353 (10 microM) had no intrinsic contractile activity and was without effect on contractions produced by KCl, histamine, prostaglandin D2, platelet-activating factor or U-44069 in guinea pig trachea. Furthermore, unlike other purported LT antagonists, LT 171883 and FPL 55712, SK&F 104353 (30 microM) did not inhibit cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity measured in homogenates from canine tracheal smooth muscle. In the isolated human bronchus, SK&F 104353 produced concentration-dependent rightward shifts in LTD4 concentration-response curves and, unlike in guinea pig trachea, was an effective antagonist of LTC4-induced contractions with a pKB of 8.0 to 8.4. This provides further evidence that, in contrast to guinea pig airways, responses produced by LTC4 and LTD4 in human bronchus appear to be mediated via the same LT receptor population.

At low dose (0.5 micrograms or 300 pmol/kg/h), SS-14 potently inhibited H+ and pepsin stimulated by bethanechol (80 micrograms/kg/h) to less than 5% of control; it required 2 micrograms or 1200 pmol/kg/h of SS-14 to achieve similar inhibition of pentagastrin (1.5 micrograms/kg/h)-stimulated secretion. In both cases, gastric [K+] was depressed by SS-14 infusion and recovered before H+ and pepsin. Similar sensitivity to SS suggests a Ca++-dependent mechanism or pathway of stimulation by gastrin similar to that by cholinergic agonists. By contrast, histamine, which acts via cyclic AMP pathways, was not inhibited by a large dose of SS-14 (20 micrograms/kg/h). SS inhibition is thus agonist (or pathway)- rather than organ- or cell-specific.\r"

  ".W": "Parietal cells have the capacity to synthesize prostaglandins (PGs) and these PGs have a significant effect on parietal cell acid secretion. We examined the stimuli responsible for the control of PG production by parietal cells. Two approaches were utilized. One consisted of measuring PGE2 concentration in the incubation media containing dispersed canine parietal cells stimulated with increasing concentrations of carbachol, histamine plus a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and pentagastrin. PGE2 was measured by radioimmunoassay. The other consisted of measuring the release of radioactive arachidonic acid by parietal cells prelabeled with [4C]arachidonic acid to increasing concentrations of the secretagogues. Both techniques gave very similar results. Only carbachol stimulated the release of PGE2 as well as [14C]arachidonic acid into the incubation media. The increase in PGE2 release was from a base line of 44.3 +/- 10.8 pg/ml to 51.0 +/- 11.7, 55.2 +/- 11.1 and 69.3 +/- 14.3 pg/ml at carbachol concentrations of 10(-6), 10(-5) and 10(-4) M, respectively. In prelabeled cells, carbachol stimulated 1072 +/- 141 and 1264 +/- 155 cpm/ml above basal at concentrations of 10(-5) and 10(-4) M, respectively. Neither histamine nor pentagastrin stimulated PGE2 or [14C]arachidonic acid release significantly at any concentration. The effect of carbachol on the release of [14C]arachidonic acid was blocked by atropine and the exclusion of calcium from the incubation media. Our data suggest that the cholinergic tone to the stomach with subsequent interaction of acetylcholine with muscarinic receptors determines the amount of PG production by the parietal cells. Prostaglandins may then modulate acid secretion by limiting the combined, potentiated effects of the secretagogues.\r"

Rhesus monkeys were trained to discriminate s.c. injections of either codeine or ethylketazocine from sham injections. In tests of drug generalization, morphine, levorphanol and alfentanil all produced dose-dependent increases in codeine-appropriate responding, and ethylketazocine produced dose-dependent increases in ethylketazocine-appropriate responding. Quadazocine antagonized the discriminative stimulus effects of each of the agonists. Apparent pA2 values for quadazocine (and slopes of the regression lines fit to the data in \"Schild Plot\" analysis) were 7.8 (-1.0) with morphine, 7.7 (-1.4) with levorphanol, 7.9 (-0.92) with alfentanil and 5.7 (-0.93) with ethylketazocine. If regression line slopes were constrained to equal -1, 7.8 was the apparent pA2 value with all agonists except ethylketazocine (5.7). This difference in apparent pA2 values for quadazocine confirms that different receptors (mu and kappa, respectively) mediate the discriminative effects of opioid agonists in codeine- and ethylketazocine-trained rhesus monkeys. Also, when the antagonism data were reanalyzed separately for each individual monkey, apparent pA2 values from individual animals were found to be similar to values from other animals in the same group and to values based on grouped data.\r"

Pretreatment with a s.c. injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) on the 1st and 2nd postnatal day or on the 14th and 15th postnatal day led to a marked suppression of the capsaicin-induced corneal lesions. This suppressive effect also was evident in case of administration after capsaicin treatment. Intraventricular injection of 6-OHDA had a slight, transient effect. DSP4 [N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine], another potent substance used for sympathetic denervation, had a suppressive effect similar to that of 6-OHDA. The concentration of capsaicin in tissues of the head was unaltered with 6-OHDA. The content of substance P (SP) in the ocular anterior segments was decreased, dose-dependently, with capsaicin administration. Neonatal administration of 6-OHDA decreased the rate of capsaicin-induced reduction of SP. However, this effect of 6-OHDA was too slight to explain the suppression of the corneal lesions, as the intensity score of lesions with a large dose of capsaicin after 6-OHDA was lower than that with a small dose of capsaicin without 6-OHDA, whereas SP content in the former was still much lower than that in the latter. On the other hand, the content of norepinephrine in the ocular tissues was decreased in the presence of 6-OHDA but not capsaicin. These results suggest that the corneal changes induced by capsaicin are largely inhibited by a decreased activity in the peripheral sympathetic system.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were performed on isolated rat mesenteric arteries with the calcium-antagonistic dihydropyridine derivative PN 200-110 in order to examine how its time-dependent effect on K+-evoked contraction might be related to voltage sensitive binding. (+)-PN 200-110 is a potent blocker of the K+-contraction in mesenteric artery. Inhibition of the K+-contraction was time-dependent and dose-effect curves were shifted to the left with the duration of depolarization. The (-)-isomer of PN 200-110 was less potent than the (+)-isomer but its action was also time-dependent. (+)-[3H]PN 200-110 binding has been determined in arteries bathed in physiological or high K+-solutions. Nonspecific binding measured in the presence of 10(-6) M nifedipine was not different in polarized and in depolarized arteries but specific binding was increased markedly after 30 min of depolarization. Specific binding data were well fitted by one hyperbolic curve describing a one-to-one binding to a single class of sites. Maximum binding capacity was unchanged whereas apparent dissociation constant was significantly lower in depolarized arteries. Depolarization also shifted to the left displacement curves of (+)-[3H]PN 200-110 by (+)- and (-)-PN 200-110. These results indicate that time-dependent effect of dihydropyridines in vascular smooth muscle is related to increased affinity of depolarized arteries for those drugs, suggesting that calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle are modulated by membrane potential in a way similar to that reported for cardiac muscle.\r"

  ".U": "88062145\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism by which various chemicals induce renal cystic disease is unknown. To examine the early events in cystogenesis the ultrastructure and biochemistry of liver and kidney were analyzed after the administration of a chemical that induces renal cyst formation. Special emphasis was placed on examining potential mechanisms that would account for the observed loss of extracellular proteoglycans. Renal cystic disease was chemically induced in rats by feeding 2-amino-4,5-diphenylthiazole (DPT) for up to 4 weeks. After 4 days of feeding, DPT had induced a 4-fold increase in total urine output relative to diet-restricted control groups. Both groups maintained, but did not gain, weight during the feeding schedule. Cyst formation was localized to the medullary collecting tubules. Relative to diet-restricted controls, rats fed DPT exhibited diminished renal and hepatic catalase activity, but elevated activity for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. Medulla showed an increase in the specific activities of the enzymes galactosyltransferase and sulfatase B. These enzymological findings correlated with ultrastructural observations of a loss of peroxisomes, proliferation of endoplasmic reticulum and enlargement of the golgi apparatus. Serum and urinary levels of inorganic sulfate were significantly increased in DPT-fed rats relative to controls. Tissue levels of UDP-glucuronic acid and adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate were not depressed by DPT feeding. Thus, DPT-induced cyst formation and loss of staining for glycosaminoglycans does not involve gross depletions of UDP-glucuronic acid and adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate, mutual cosubstrates for Phase II drug conjugation reactions and glycosaminoglycan synthesis.\r"

This study reviewed selected patient admissions for PID from Northwestern Memorial Hospital for the years 1981-1985. The costs of hospitalization and treatment and the inherent diagnostic error rate were considered concurrently. No significant additional expense would have been incurred if all the women admitted with a clinical diagnosis of PID had had laparoscopic verification of their clinical diagnoses as compared to the cost of treatment with intravenous antibiotics for three to five days. We recommend the early use of laparoscopy in establishing the diagnosis of PID because it ensures a more accurate and definitive diagnosis and does not add significantly to costs.\r"

Increased levels of serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen have been observed during the acute-phase response. One possible mediator of the acute-phase response is interleukin-1, a pro-inflammatory monokine released in response to traumatic tissue injury or infection. There is evidence that partially purified macrophage supernatants containing interleukin-1 activity stimulate hepatocyte secretion of SAA, CRP, and fibrinogen. The effect of interleukin-1 on mouse liver serum amyloid A mRNA levels was investigated. The acute-phase response was induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of interleukin-1 obtained from cloned murine recombinant DNA. We monitored SAA mRNA levels using DNA/RNA dot blot hybridization. Interleukin-1 stimulated a dose-dependent increase in SAA mRNA levels compared to unstimulated controls. In contrast, mRNA levels for apolipoprotein E (a constitutive hepatic protein not produced as part of the acute-phase response) were unchanged under identical conditions. Interleukin-1 also induced SAA mRNA in an endotoxin-resistant strain of mice (C3H/HeJ), indicating that this stimulation was not due to endotoxin contamination since endotoxin alone was unable to induce SAA mRNA in these mice. These results indicate that recombinant interleukin-1, when injected intraperitoneally into mice, induced specific production of SAA mRNA and hence one phase of the acute-phase response.\r"

However, the number of, and the proportion of, elderly victims of injury will increase as there will be an additional 5.3 million (+18.5%) people age 65 years or older. Yet payments based on Medicare diagnosis-related groups (DRG's) do not provide adequate reimbursement for any, let alone the elderly, victims of injury. Moreover, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements for the long-term care so frequently needed by the elderly victims of injury is inadequate. As our population ages, the adverse financial impact of these circumstances resultant from population aging will increasingly strain the financial resources of our trauma centers.\r"

All patients were in the older age group, with a mean age of 77.6 years, and they were debilitated by a variety of medical problems, including major surgery, neoplasia, recurrent bacterial infection, diabetes or other metabolic dysfunction. Miconazole at a concentration of 50 mcg. per ml. was administered continuously during 24 hours for 5 consecutive days via a urethral catheter. Candiduria resolved in 8 of the 10 patients, with 1 requiring a second course of miconazole at a concentration of 100 mcg. per ml. Two patients manifested other foci of infection, necessitating intravenous and intravesical amphotericin B. Stability studies showed that the miconazole irrigation solutions maintain their antifungal activity for 11 days at room temperature. The 5-day cost (drug and materials) of the miconazole irrigation at 50 mcg. per ml. was $17.75 versus $76.75 for an equal course of therapy with amphotericin B. In addition, compared to amphotericin B as an antifungal genitourinary irrigant, miconazole is prepared more easily, requires less labor and preparation time, and does not require refrigeration or protection from light. These clinical observations indicate that miconazole is a cost-effective antifungal genitourinary irrigant.\r"

This strain of P. aeruginosa has an MIC of 0.6 microgram/ml and an MBC of 50 micrograms/mL when tested by conventional methods. When 14C-glutamic acid was used as a substrate in this radiorespirometric assay, it could be completed in less than one hour and planktonic samples showed a significant reduction in mineralization activity (evolution of 14CO2) within eight hours of the antibiotic challenge. These changes in respiratory activity appeared to be dose and time dependent. Within 18 hr. at 1000 micrograms/mL, there was no significant residual respiratory activity in planktonic samples. Some residual respiratory activity was detected, however, in samples exposed to 100 micrograms/mL for 36 hours. The mineralization activity of sessile catheter-associated bacteria was unaffected by four hr. and eight hr. exposures to 1000 micrograms/mL of the antibiotic. A significant reduction in respiratory activity was recorded in catheter samples exposed for 18 hr. or more at each concentration examined. Unlike the planktonic samples, however, the antibiotic challenge failed to eradicate the metabolic activity of the attached bacteria. Antibiotic stressed, catheter-associated bacteria transferred to a post-exposure enrichment broth showed a limited ability to re-establish respiratory activity. This apparent recovery was limited to antibiotic exposures less than 24 hr. and was not observed in planktonic samples. The radioisotopic assay is a non-culture method which can be used to assess the antibiotic sensitivity of both planktonic bacteria and \"in situ\" biofilm populations. Clinically, it can be used to demonstrate that some adherent biofilm bacteria can survive the exposure to antibiotics that is achieved in routine chemotherapy.\r"

The other six patients had no increase in inhibitor levels while on the study protocol. Inhibitors became undetectable within one to ten months in nine of the patients; they now receive smaller and less frequent infusions of factor VIII to maintain suppression. Inhibitors were not eradicated in three patients, who had the highest baseline and historic inhibitor levels. Ten patients gave consent for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing; three had no antibody to HIV at the outset. Two of these patients seroconverted while on the protocol, one of whom had received only donor-screened, heat-treated factor VIII. Thus, the benefits of inhibitor suppression must be weighed against the risks of HIV seroconversion or transient elevation of inhibitor levels, as well as against the cost of the factor concentrate used.\r"

ACI/N rats, known to be less sensitive to azo dye carcinogenesis, were given one of these compounds in their diets for 120 days. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in group 2 (20/20), which was given 3'-CH2OH-DAB, was much higher than that in any of the other groups: group 1 (2'-CH2OH-DAB; 4/19), group 3 (4'-CH2OH-DAB; 1/25), or group 4 (3'-CH3-DAB; 3/24). These data suggest that 3'-CH2OH-DAB is the most potent hepatocarcinogen in the series of azo dyes. Possible reasons for the potency of the chemical are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy (IORT) is a new combined modality therapy in the treatment of cancer. IORT is delivered during a surgical procedure to a tumor or tumor bed and areas of possible local regional spread, with the ability to shield or physically move normal tissues and organs out of the treatment volume. IORT is feasible for various intraabdominal, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and other malignancies. It is possible to increase the total radiation dose, thereby improving the therapeutic ratio; a better local control without an increasing morbidity. Although the optimum use of IORT is still unknown, it is believed that its greatest value is in combination with maximal surgical resection of the tumor with or without external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). IORT is still an experimental treatment modality combining surgery, EBRT, and if necessary, chemotherapy. Because IORT is an expensive treatment method, it is important to determine which method is the best and most convenient for the patient. The answer can be given only when prospective, randomized clinical IORT trials and cost-effectiveness studies are initiated.\r"

  ".W": "In order to determine whether a no-flush, core-cooling technique could provide extended heart-lung preservation, we placed donor calves on cardiopulmonary bypass and instituted rapid cooling to 15 degrees C during the continuous infusion of isoproterenol. The heart and lungs were harvested after the administration of a cardioplegic solution through the aortic root. In the control group (N = 5), heart and lungs were orthotopically allotransplanted immediately. In the preserved group (N = 5), heart and lungs were similarly excised but were stored in a normal saline bath at 4 degrees C for approximately 4 hours and then transplanted. Both groups received isoproterenol during reperfusion and were studied for 6 hours after implantation. A load independent analysis of myocardial function was done by determining with a sonomicrometer the ratio of the end-systolic pressure to the end-systolic dimension. Pulmonary preservation was evaluated by measurement of extravascular lung water with a double-indicator dilution method, arterial oxygenation on 100% inspired oxygen, and serial lung biopsies. Myocardial and pulmonary function after 4 hours of static preservation was found to be similar to controls. No-flush, core-cooling with cardiopulmonary bypass provides adequate cardiorespiratory function after acute bovine heart-lung allotransplantation. With the use of this technique, successful extended cold ischemic cardiopulmonary preservation for heart-lung transplantation may be achieved.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical cardiopulmonary transplantation is currently limited by the availability of suitable heart-lung donors. Distant graft procurement, with pretreatment, of the donor by intravenous prostaglandin E1 and cooling of the graft with pulmonary artery perfusion, is now clinically established and should increase the number of available donors. Between March 1981 and September 1986, 40 heart-lung transplantations were performed. The characteristics of the donor pool were analyzed. Gram stain of the donor tracheal aspirate revealed gram-positive bacteria in 80% and gram-negative organisms in 35%. Yeast was present on stain in 25% of the patients. Donor arterial oxygen tension was less than 100 torr inspired oxygen concentration 40%) repeatedly in one patient; this recipient died of lung failure at operation. Severe deterioration of allograft lung function was seen in 11 (27.5%) recipients. The causes of deterioration were substantial postoperative bleeding in six patients, sepsis in two, and acute rejection, poor lung function, and allograft heart failure in one patient each. HLA-A locus mismatch, poor donor alveolar-capillary gas exchange, tracheal colonization with heavy polymorphonuclear cells, and heavy bacteria and fungus resulted in increased operative mortality. Donor pretreatment with prostaglandin E1 was associated with improved survival. Recipient selection, emphasizing adequate liver function and absence of previous thoracic operation, careful surgical technique with minimal bleeding, and brief perfusion time were factors associated with improved survival. Early morbidity and mortality were principally related to recipient risk factors, and the strict criteria observed for selection of heart-lung donors were valid. The importance of appropriate recipient selection is underscored.\r"

  ".W": "The class Ic antiarrhythmic agent flecainide has recently become available in this country for management of ventricular arrhythmias. The pharmacologic and electrophysiologic features of this class of drug--marked sodium channel blockade producing inhibition of phase 0 of the myocardial action potential, moderate blockade of slow inward (calcium) channels, and general lack of systemic toxicity--suggest that these agents may exert significant myocardial protective effects. This hypothesis was tested in isolated, perfused rat hearts subjected to 30 minutes of global normothermic ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion after pretreatment with (1) Krebs-Henseleit buffer (n = 7); (2) Krebs-Henseleit buffer with potassium adjusted to 20.9 mmol/L with potassium chloride (n = 10); and (3) Krebs-Henseleit buffer plus flecainide acetate 50 mg/L (0.12 mmol/L) (n = 11). Severity of ischemic injury was assessed by time to ischemic contracture: 9.9 +/- 1.3 (Krebs-Henseleit buffer), 18.4 +/- 1.1 (potassium chloride), and 25.4 +/- 1.0 (flecainide) minutes (mean +/- standard error of the mean) (p less than 0.05 among all groups). Functional recovery after ischemia and reperfusion was measured by developed pressure (expressed as percent of preischemic control): 19.6 +/- 5.4 (Krebs-Henseleit buffer), 70.8 +/- 3.2 (potassium chloride), and 67.3 +/- 2.7 (flecainide). These results suggest that class Ic agents afford significant myocardial protection from global normothermic ischemia.\r"

With a dose of 500 mg twice daily by mouth, blood pressure rose gradually from 100/55 to 145/85 mm Hg, and orthostatic hypotension disappeared. After 4 months' treatment the patient is free of symptoms and able to live a normal life. DOPS switched on the production of noradrenaline and reduced the excessive production of dopamine. During treatment plasma noradrenaline rose normally after standing and after infusion of tyramine, a biogenic amine that liberates stored neurotransmitter from sympathetic nerve terminals. These data demonstrate that in congenital dopamine-beta-hydroxylase deficiency dopamine instead of noradrenaline is released as the sympathetic neurotransmitter but that the integrity of the sympathetic neuron is otherwise intact.\r"

Neopterin levels and triglycerides were shown to be the best variables for discriminating between the hepatitis and fatty liver patients, neopterin being the more specific of the two. Neopterin excretion in chronic persistent hepatitis was not statistically different from that in chronic active hepatitis. In the absence of specific tests, increased neopterin excretion seems to be a useful marker for diagnosing chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis and particularly in differentiating it from fatty liver.\r"

These thermograms were compared to histological analysis of the respective samples and the following results were obtained: (1) After the application of each laser there is very little propagation of heat in tissue. (2) The CO2 laser makes tissue reach 100 degrees C in less than 0.05 seconds. (3) The heat dissipation time was higher with the Nd-YAG laser due to higher scattering on tissue.

To evaluate prospectively various procedures proposed for salvage of the spleen, we measured reticuloendothelial function for two to five years in 51 patients who had initially presented with abdominal trauma and suspected splenic rupture. The mean percentage of pocked erythrocytes and the clearance of antibody-coated autologous erythrocytes in 8 patients who had splenic repair and in 6 who had partial splenectomy were the same as in 11 controls with intraabdominal injury that did not involve the spleen. The mean percentage of pocked erythrocytes remained significantly elevated in 19 patients who had undergone total splenectomy without autotransplantation of splenic tissue. One of seven patients who underwent splenic autotransplantation had a normal level of pocked erythrocytes 18 months after surgery, and a second patient had only a slight elevation at 24 months. The mean (+/- SEM) half-time clearance of labeled erythrocytes was significantly longer in the group that had total splenectomy without autotransplantation (421.1 +/- 74.5 hours) than in the autotransplantation group (91.6 +/- 20.0) or in the controls (5.4 +/- 2.0). We conclude that reticuloendothelial function was better preserved after partial splenectomy and splenic repair than after splenic autotransplantation, but that autotransplantation was superior to total splenectomy and appeared to be safe. Splenic autotransplantation deserves further study in patients who have had splenic trauma when other surgical maneuvers to save the spleen are not possible.\r"

Administration of the study drug was followed by coronary arteriography, and candidates for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were randomly assigned either to undergo angioplasty on the third hospital day (n = 42) or not to undergo angioplasty during the 10-day study period (n = 43). The patency rates of the infarct-related arteries were 66 percent in the t-PA group and 24 percent in the placebo group. No fatal or intracerebral hemorrhages occurred, and episodes of bleeding requiring transfusion were observed in 7.6 percent of the placebo group and 9.8 percent of the t-PA group. As compared with the use of placebo, administration of t-PA was associated with a higher mean (+/- SEM) ejection fraction on the 10th hospital day (53.2 +/- 2.0 vs. 46.4 +/- 2.0 percent, P less than 0.02), an improved ejection fraction during the study period (+3.6 +/- 1.3 vs. -4.7 +/- 1.3 percentage points, P less than 0.0001), and a reduction in the prevalence of congestive heart failure from 33 to 14 percent (P less than 0.01). Angioplasty improved the response of the ejection fraction to exercise (+8.1 +/- 1.4 vs. +1.2 +/- 2.2 percentage points, P less than 0.02) and reduced the incidence of postinfarction angina from 19 to 5 percent (P less than 0.05), but did not influence the ejection fraction at rest. These data support an approach to the treatment of acute myocardial infarction that includes early intravenous administration of t-PA and deferred cardiac catheterization and coronary angioplasty.\r"

This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that TRH is hydrolysed at the pyroGlu-His bond by a particulate enzyme located in the synaptosomal and adenohypophyseal plasma membrane. Furthermore, this enzyme has been identified as a heterogeneously distributed ectoenzyme which has a high degree of substrate specificity like the TRH-degrading serum enzyme studied previously. In the rat, the activity of the TRH-degrading serum enzyme has been shown to be influenced by the thyroid status of the animals; here I report that the activity of the membrane-bound TRH-degrading enzyme of the anterior pituitary is stringently controlled by thyroid hormones, but that the activity of the brain enzyme is not.\r"

  ".W": "The convergent evolution of a fermentative foregut in two groups of mammals offers an opportunity to study adaptive evolution at the protein level. The appearance of this mode of digestion has been accompanied by the recruitment of lysozyme as a bacteriolytic enzyme in the stomach both in the ruminants (for example the cow) and later in the colobine monkeys (for example the langur). The stomach lysozymes of these two groups share some physicochemical and catalytic properties that appear to adapt them for functioning in the stomach fluid. To examine the basis for these shared properties, we sequenced langur stomach lysozyme and compared it to other lysozymes of known sequence. Tree analysis suggest that, after foregut fermentation arose in monkeys, the langur lysozyme gained sequence similarity to cow stomach lysozyme and evolved two times faster than the other primate lysozymes. This rapid evolution, coupled with functional and sequence convergence upon cow stomach lysozyme, could imply that positive darwinian selection has driven about 50% of the evolution of langur stomach lysozyme.\r"

Only one allele of the heavy and light chain gene locus is found functionally rearranged in normal B cells. The second allele is either non-functionally or incompletely rearranged, a phenomenon known as allelic exclusion. Recently, we and others have shown that expression of a rearranged mu gene introduced into the germline of mice leads to inhibition of rearrangement of endogenous heavy chain genes. It has been suggested that mu also exerts a positive influence on kappa light chain gene rearrangement. Here we show that a functionally rearranged delta gene is also able to prevent endogenous heavy chain gene rearrangement and could promote kappa light chain gene rearrangement.\r"

Peripheral blood lymphocytes of apes, New World and Old World monkeys express cell surface antigens homologous to CD4 of human T-helper lymphocytes. The cells of several of these species can be infected in short term culture with diverse strains of the type-1 or type-2 human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2). HIV-1 is the prototype AIDS virus, and HIV-2 is the second type of AIDS virus, prevalent in West Africa. Infection of the primate cells correlates with evolutionary conservation on CD4 of one particular epitope cluster, and is inhibited by treatment of the cells with monoclonal antibodies to this epitope. The capacity of HIV to replicate in simian cells may provide a means for evaluating antiviral drugs and vaccines.\r"

  ".W": "Gs and Gi are guanine nucleotide-binding, heterotrimer proteins that regulate the activity of adenylate cyclase, and are responsible for transferring stimulatory and inhibitory hormonal signals, respectively, from cell surface receptors to the enzyme catalytic unit. These proteins can be directly activated by agents such as GTP and analogues, fluoride and magnesium. Decreased amounts of Gs and Gi, and even the absence of Gs, have been described, whereas an altered Gs has been reported in a cultured cell line (UNC variant of S49 lymphoma cells), but has never been observed in human disease states. We have found a profoundly altered Gs protein in a group of human growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas, characterized by high secretory activity and intracellular cyclic AMP levels. In the membranes from these tumours no stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by growth hormone-releasing hormone, by GTP or by fluoride was observed. Indeed, the last two agents caused an inhibition, probably mediated by Gi. In contrast, adenylate cyclase stimulation by Mg2+ was enormously increased. This altered pattern of adenylate cyclase regulation was reproduced when a cholate extract of the tumour membranes (which contains G proteins) was reconstituted with Gs-free, cyc- S49 cell membranes. Inasmuch as secretion from somatotrophic cells is known to be a cAMP-dependent function, the alteration of Gs could be the direct cause of the high secretory activity of the tumours in which it occurs.\r"

Administration of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against gamma interferon (gamma IFN) to immune hosts, reversed sterile immunity to sporozoite challenge, by allowing the growth of exoerythrocytic forms (EEF) and thus the development of parasitaemia. Immune animals also developed infections when depleted in vivo of their suppressor/cytotoxic T cells expressing the CD8 antigen (CD8+) but not when depleted of helper T cells expressing CD4 antigen (CD4+), before sporozoite challenge. Passive transfer of immune immunoglobin alone, or adoptive transfer of immune T cells alone, conferred partial protection to naive recipients. Transfer of both immune components resulted in significantly greater protection. This transferred immunity was reversed by the in vivo neutralization of gamma IFN. Thus, sterile immunity to sporozoite challenge requires the neutralization of sporozoites by antibodies and the inhibition of EEF development by gamma IFN with the participation of CD8+ cells.\r"

  ".W": "The intraventricular administration of 0.2 or 2 micrograms of synthetic rat atrial natriuretic factor (syn rANF), sequence 101-126 of the precursor, prevented the water accumulation elicited in rat brain by a systemic hypoosmolar fluid load and led to a statistically significant sodium loss from the nervous tissue, while the potassium content remained unaltered. Similar syn rANF administration to rats not treated with a hypoosmolar fluid load caused no significant change in the water, potassium, and sodium content of the hemispheres. In this experiment, a primary systemic action of centrally administered syn rANF with ensuing secondary changes in brain ion and water homeostasis seems unlikely, as the serum osmolality and sodium and potassium concentrations remained unaltered. Thus, a central influence of the intraventricularly administered hormone upon the water and ion balances of the nervous tissue can be hypothesized. The significant loss of sodium may reflect the primary role of volume regulation of the nervous tissue, i.e., the loss of extracellular osmols such as Na+ in response to a hypoosmolar environment. These data lend further support to the concept that a central neuroendocrine system regulates brain ion and volume homeostasis. The possible role of ANF in the management of brain edema should be considered.\r"

End-tidal CO2 was monitored during hyperventilation to avoid excessive reduction of CO2. There were three types of blood flow responses to hyperventilation: simple reduction, prolonged reduction, and increase. Simple reduction was noted in four cases and was related to constriction of basal and ethmoidal moyamoya vessels. Prolonged reduction was noted in three cases and was related to excessive constriction of basal moyamoya vessels. Increase was noted in four cases and was related to increase in blood flow from cranial vault moyamoya vessels. The results indicate that the basal moyamoya vessels are constricted by hyperventilation. This may be the cause of ischemic symptoms provoked by hyperventilation.\r"

One hundred eighty-eight cases of stage I grade 2 adenocarcinoma of favorable histologic subtype (adenocarcinoma, adenoacanthoma) and limited myometrial invasion (less than one-third of the myometrium) were identified. Surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy was used in 136 cases, and 52 cases were treated with surgery alone. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in menopausal status, parity, exogenous estrogen, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, or uterine size. Five-year survival for the surgery and radiotherapy group was 94% (128 of 136), and the recurrence rate was 2.2% (three of 136). The five-year survival for the surgery-alone group was 98% (51 of 52), and the recurrence rate was 1.9% (one of 52). There was no statistically significant difference in five-year survival or recurrence between the two groups. This study suggests that surgery alone is adequate treatment for stage I grade 2 adenocarcinoma of favorable histologic subtype and limited myometrial invasion. This study also shows a possible benefit in the combined use of histologic subtype, grade, and myometrial invasion as prognostic indicators and as guides for adjuvant radiotherapy.\r"

The vitrectomy probe was then passed through a peripheral iridotomy, the peripheral posterior capsule and/or zonules, and into the anterior vitreous. The peripheral iridotomy allowed access to the vitreous cavity for an anterior vitrectomy. The entire anterior chamber and vitreous aspirate was then analyzed for culture and sensitivity.

Six lens types providing a wide range in oxygen transmissibilities (Dk/L)O2 from 0.15 to 55.0 X 10(-9) (cm ml O2/seconds of ml mmHg) were used. Stromal pH upon opening the eyes was directly related to (Dk/L)O2 and ranged from 7.01 to 7.26. These pH values were all significantly lower than the control (no lens), which had a pH of 7.38 (P less than 0.005). After eye opening (lens still on) stromal pH increased and reached a new steady-state (range, 7.11-7.45) in approximately 30 minutes; however, these pH levels were still below the control (no lens) (pH 7.54; P less than 0.005). The rate of pH change after eye opening also increased directly with (Dk/L)O2. The authors conclude that the lenses presently available provide insufficient gas exchange to prevent alteration of corneal pH and suggest that the measurement of stromal pH may provide a sensitive index for evaluating the metabolic effects of contract lens wear.\r"

Normal tear components such as aqueous solutions of albumin, lysozyme, and lactoferrin all significantly enhance adherence of P. aeruginosa to unworn EWSCLs often by as much as 300%. The presence of a 1% solution of sialic acid in the bathing medium significantly reduces the adherence of P. aeruginosa to both unworn and worn lenses. Inhibition of bacterial adherence could also be achieved with the addition of mucin (which contains terminal sialic acid residues in its major sugar chains). Therefore, selective adherence by P. aeruginosa to a specific sugar (sialic acid) may be important in the initial attachment of the bacterium to soft contact lenses.\r"

The tissues which stained intensely for t-PA included the corneal endothelium, corneal epithelium, trabecular meshwork, lens epithelium, peripheral vitreous, uveal tract, inner retina, and all vascular endothelia. The apparent minor difference in staining intensity between human and monkey eyes may be related to the time-dependent degradation of t-PA, to variations in the tissue content of t-PA, or to the difference in animal species.

It has also lead to vigorous debates within and without the profession about the efficacy of the procedure and its cost-benefit ratio. Criticism directed toward cataract surgery, both by those in the medical profession and those in governmental agencies, must be addressed if ophthalmologists are going to continue to be able to meet the needs of their patients.\r"

Likewise, although published results on the surgical treatment of tympanosclerotic ears are infrequent, most otologists are aware of greater than usual risks of severe sensorineural impairment from ossiculoplasty in this type of middle ear disease. Because of recent developments in implanted aids-to-hearing, in tympanoplasty operations, when they fail to adequately improve hearing, preservation of eighth nerve function becomes ever-increasingly important. This article concerns two types of middle ear disease in which surgical treatment threatens hair cells and neurons, to the extent that surgical complications might prejudice the eventual possible benefits of a standard hearing aid or any implanted device, if either was indicated.\r"

  ".W": "Pneumatic otoscopy has long been espoused as an easily and rapidly used, inexpensive method for routine evaluation of the tympanic membrane and middle ear. This widely used technique, however, has not been explored in a quantitative manner. Therefore, we measured the differential pressure and frequency of the pressure pulse used by a group of experienced otoscopists during routine pneumatic otoscopic examination. We found the pressure pulse varied from 170 to 520 mm H2O and the frequency varied from 2.2 to 4.9 pulses per second. We used a pneumatic pump to deliver a controlled pressure pulse--at a frequency of 4.0/sec--to the pneumatic otoscope. This device was used to measure the minimum pressure pulse necessary for the experienced otoscopist to merely detect tympanic membrane movement in normal ears. The threshold for visible movement ranged from 10 to 15 mm H2O. Thus, even the most gentle otoscopist used a pressure pulse an order of magnitude higher than the threshold for detection of visible movement in normal ears. The gap between the pressure pulse at threshold for visual detection of movement and that which is routinely used offers the possibility of increased sensitivity and specificity for this commonly used diagnostic tool. Preliminary data are presented from this study in which the pressure pulses required for visual detection of tympanic membrane movement in diseased ears were determined.\r"

A new fistula test has been developed based upon vestibulo-spinal responses. By systematic removal of both visual and support-surface orientation references from the subject--leaving only vestibular control of postural reflexes--patients with perilymph fistulas demonstrated an increased (sometimes phase-locked) postural sway in response to sinusoidal changes in external auditory canal pressures. Results from 100 consecutively operated ears (64 patients)--77 of whom underwent preoperative and postoperative moving-platform fistula tests--indicate that the test sensitivity is 97 percent for this highly selective patient population. Absolute specificity could not be determined because, on patients without clinical indications for surgery, tympanotomy is contraindicated.\r"

These patients require more proximal stimulation of the auditory pathway. One potential area for such stimulation is the cochlear nuclear complex (CNC) in the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle. If animal studies establish the safety and efficacy of such stimulation, electrical stimulation of the human cochlear nuclear complex may become an accepted treatment modality for this select group of patients. Such implantation requires that the surgeon accurately locate the cochlear nuclear complex without destruction of vital surrounding neural and vascular structures. With ten fresh human brains, oriented for a translabyrinthine approach, we determined key anatomical landmarks to the exposed surface of the CNC on both sides of each brain. Using a combination of anatomical landmarks--including the flocculus, eighth nerve root, choroid plexus, and taenia--we located the cochlear nuclear complex (without disruption of surrounding neural or vascular structures) and marked it with colloidal carbon. Access to the CNC was obtained in all 20 specimens, and histologic sections confirmed the carbon marker in the CNC in 19 of 20 specimens.\r"

Twenty-six patients were able to achieve oral feeding. There was one immediate and one delayed failure of the graft. Twelve fistulas developed, seven of which healed spontaneously in less than 2 weeks. Four patients experienced complications related to the microvascular anastomosis which required repair. Six patients had significant dysphagia; four of these had side-to-end distal anastomosis. This technique had been abandoned and improvement resulted. We conclude that free jejunal transfer is an expeditious, safe, and reliable method of reconstruction for patients who require total laryngopharyngectomy.\r"

Stimulation of the olfactory bulb (OB) determined if the OT neurons were olfactory-related. Ipsilateral VTA stimulation produced a change in neuronal activity in 77% of the neurons tested, with 41% being inhibited, 24% excited, and 12% had mixed response. Contralateral VTA stimulation produced changes in only 38%. Intravenous administration of haloperidol was used in examination of the role of dopamine in this neural connection. The results suggest that the VTA-induced inhibitory response on OT neurons is mediated by dopamine, whereas excitatory responses are not. The VTA inhibitory influence projects primarily to olfactory-related neurons, since 60% of olfactory-related OT neurons were inhibited--as compared to 34% of non-olfactory-related neurons. This study documents electrophysiologically the VTA-OT connection and suggests that the dopaminergic input may modulate olfactory information projected to the OT from the OB. It also supports the concept that the OT acts as an integration center in central olfactory processing.\r"

Nerve regeneration was assessed at 20 weeks by muscle-twitch strength and compound action potential parameters measured proximal and distal to the repair site. Conduction velocity and regenerative index (ratio of distal to proximal compound action potential area) were calculated. Significant improvement of the regenerative index and twitch strength occurred in animals treated with a 0.5 mg 21-day-release pellet. Improvement occurred in animals treated with 0.5 mg 60-day pellets, but the difference was not significant. The findings suggest that regeneration was enhanced as a result of increased numbers of axons that made distal connections in the animals that received 21-day-release triamcinolone systemically. Corticosteroid therapy may benefit motor nerve repair.\r"

Fifty-nine patients who underwent extirpative clean-contaminated procedures--all of whom received cefazolin as the sole chemoprophylactic agent, were studied over a 1-year period. Twenty-three variables were recorded for each patient in the study. The overall rate of wound infection was 25.4%. Univariate analysis indicated that three variables were significantly related to the likelihood of postoperative wound infection. These included tumor stage (P = 0.0180), nodal stage (P = 0.0062), and duration of surgery (P = 0.0151). The Biomedical Computer Program (BMDP), a logistic regression program specifically designed for a binary dependent variable (infection vs. no infection) based on independent variables that may be continuous or categorical, was used in development of a model predictive of wound infection. T-stage, N-stage, and the presence of concomitant disease made up the combination of factors found to be most predictive of infection in our study population. Considering \"success\" to be the development of infection if the probability was 75% or higher, and the absence of infection if the probability was less than 25%, the multiple regression analysis model demonstrated a predictive success rate of 74.6%. Our results indicate that the risk of infection in patients undergoing clean-contaminated oncologic surgery of the head and neck is greatest for patients who have advanced disease that requires prolonged surgery in the presence of concomitant diseases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore, we recommend that corticosteroid therapy for LTB be limited to 48 degrees in duration. This case also demonstrates that when an atypical clinical course is being followed by a patient who has LTB, then early diagnostic intervention is indicated. If HSV-1 is identified, anti-viral chemotherapy should be initiated and artificial airway management may be necessary. Tracheal intubation may be used, but, if extensive subglottic ulceration occurs, the subglottis should be bypassed in order that the chance of subglottic stenosis be minimized. In this case, early identification by bronchoscopy and viral cultures resulted in a successful combined medical-surgical management and total resolution with no sequelae.\r"

The promontory, the tragus, and two external sutures stabilized the electrode during surgery. The only noted otologic sequallae of electrode placement were small circular lesions at tympanic membrane puncture sites. Satisfactory ECoG recordings were obtained in five of seven cases. Peak-to-peak N1 amplitudes were (on average) 13.4-fold larger than the corresponding amplitudes of peak I of the surface-recorded brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) recordings. During acoustic neuroma resection, ECoG and BAEP recordings changed relatively independently, which suggests multiple mechanisms and/or sites of injury to the cochlea or cochlear nerve. However, once they had become manifest, none of the observed changes exhibited a tendency to return to preoperative patterns. Hearing was preserved postoperatively in only two of seven patients, one of whom could not be monitored due to technical difficulty. Transtragal, transtympanic electrode placement provided a rapid, stable, and safe method of obtaining intraoperative ECoG recordings. Although combined intraoperative monitoring of ECoG and BAEP responses appeared to provide more precise documentation of injury to the cochlea and/or cochlear nerve, it was probably not influential in preservation of hearing in this series.\r"

Until the present decade, preoperative localization procedures were of little help because of poor resolution of imaging modalities, significant morbidity, and the cost of invasive procedures. The efficacy of preoperative high-resolution CT scanning was evaluated in ten patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who had not previously been operated on. Contrast and noncontrast scans were performed on each patient, under the supervision of an experienced radiologist. Surgical findings were the standard against which all CT scans were judged. Each patient was diagnosed as having a single adenoma. Preoperative scans localized eight of ten adenomas for an overall sensitivity of 80 percent. In one patient, the adenoma was incorrectly localized for a specificity of 89 percent. The smallest adenoma correctly localized measured 4 x 4 mm in its axial dimensions. In addition to shortening operative time, accurate preoperative localization permitted use of unilateral dissection technique. Recent literature has repeatedly proved unilateral dissection superior to bilateral dissection by production of identical cure rates and a 2- to 12-fold decrease in postoperative hypocalcemia. We suggest that CT scanning be considered in the routine preoperative workup of patients who have primary hyperparathyroid disease.\r"

  ".W": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic disorder in white patients. The protean manifestations of the disease result from exocrine gland dysfunction and include chronically debilitating pulmonary and pancreatic compromise and clinically inconsequential (although diagnostically extremely important) sweat electrolyte abnormalities. The subject of this article is the otolaryngologic manifestations of the disease, based on a retrospective analysis of 450 cases. Nasal polyposis and sinusitis occurred in 10% and 11% of patients, respectively, and polypectomy was, after laparotomy, the most common surgical procedure these children underwent. The extent of intranasal surgery for polyposis was found to be inversely proportional to the recurrence rate. A simple polypectomy was relatively ineffective treatment; when performed in conjunction with a Caldwell-Luc and either an intranasal or extranasal ethmoidectomy, the recurrence rate was less than 13%. Otologic problems, found in 8% of patients, included chronic otitis media (2.5%) and acute otitis media (5.5%). Only five patients required pressure-equalizing tubes. Recent genetic advances of immense importance are also described. Although the basic gene defect has yet to be elucidated, by use of a technique known as restriction-fragment-linked polymorphism, the gene associated with CF has been found in the middle of the long arm of chromosome 7. By following gene markers closely associated with this gene, it is possible to do carrier tests within affected families and, if certain criteria are met, perform prenatal diagnosis. Eventual isolation and characterization of the gene will follow, hopefully making prevention possible and treatment more effective.\r"

  ".W": "In 1983, 75,000 to 90,000 children and youth in the United States had hearing impairments severe enough to warrant some sort of special education, and 28% of that total (i.e., 21,000 to 25,000) were in residential schools. Deaf youngsters in institutional settings are at risk for maltreatment by surrogate caretakers--foster parents or institutional child care workers. Attempts to report the abuse may produce denials by institutional administrators who do not want to believe that children under their care have been abused or who fear serious personal and/or institutional consequences should the abuse report become public. Clearly, steps must be taken to ensure the safety of deaf children being educated in residential institutions. Health providers must assume a special responsibility for detecting and preventing abuse/neglect of handicapped children for whom they are providing medical care on a continuing basis. This article will explore relevant aspects of the present system for delivery of health services to deaf children, as well as present specific strategies for detection, documentation, and prevention of maltreatment of these particularly vulnerable children.\r"

It is believed that this reduction in F0 is a result of edema of the vocal folds caused by tobacco smoke. This study investigated F0 changes during smoking and no-smoking periods. Data were collected before, during, and after a 40-hour period of no-smoking. Analysis of the voice recordings showed a rise in voice F0 for the two smoking subjects during the 40-hour no-smoking period. Age- and sex-matched control subjects did not show a rise in their F0 during the same tasks. Results suggest that the pitch-lowering effects of cigarette smoking may be reversed after as few as 40 hours of smoking cessation.\r"

It has been claimed that this tumor may undergo dedifferentiation after radiotherapy; this will result in a more aggressive behavior. From 1968 to 1980, we have diagnosed and treated 569 squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. Fourteen of them were reported to exhibit verrucous features macroscopically. These tumors were histopathologically reexamined. All 569 cases were stratified with regard to tumor stage (less than or equal to T2 N0 M0) and treatment (irradiation). Six patients of 340 were then diagnosed as having verrucous squamous cell carcinomas, according to the Ackerman criteria. The patients were followed for at least 5 years and regional metastases of poorly differentiated carcinoma developed in at least two patients in the verrucous carcinoma group within 2 1/2 years after full-dose irradiation. Among the patients with nonverrucous carcinoma, this frequency was estimated to be 3%. This study provides evidence that metastatic spread that occurs after irradiation is approximately 10 times more frequent (p less than 0.05) for T1-2 laryngeal verrucous carcinomas, as compared to the common type of squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

High-placed stoma, flexed cervical position, and short, obese necks are predisposing anatomic relationships. In some long-standing tracheostomies, progressive erosion of the upper anterior tracheal wall and cricoid arch is observed, often with secondary subglottic stenosis. No discussion of measures to prevent or correct these problems was found in a review of the literature. This article discusses surgical techniques to (1) prevent laryngotracheal erosion and (2) repair and reconstruct an airway that is already damaged. A superiorly based tracheostomy flap and a muscular sling are designed to buttress the tracheostomy. Results and follow-up are also reported.\r"

Two major possible causes of his hearing loss are (1) actual involvement of spiral ganglion or acoustic division of the eighth cranial nerve by HTLV III virus, or (2) cryptococcal meningitis. He ultimately died after a series of neurological complications developed. These complications, which are common in patients with AIDS, include progressive dementia, obtundation, and coma. As the number of patients with AIDS in our society increases over the next 5 years, it will become more important for the otolaryngologist to recognize the complications of this disease that involve the ear, nose, throat, head, and neck. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is one of these complications. The acquired immune deficiency syndrome, at this point, might best be treated by an approach of preventive medicine. However, such an approach would have far-reaching social and political implications--perhaps more so than in other venereally spread diseases. In the interim, the otolaryngologist-head and neck specialist is required to recognize AIDS as it manifests itself in the head and neck. In this case, sudden-onset sensorineural hearing loss was the otolaryngologic presentation of the AIDS.\r"

Squirrel monkeys with proven susceptibility to rotation-induced vomiting were given surgical bilateral labyrinthectomies, a procedure known to abolish signs and symptoms of motion sickness in human beings. Postoperatively, labyrinthectomized monkeys neither vomited nor revealed any reduction in food consumption when exposed to provocative rotation. Other samples of monkeys known to be refractory to horizontal rotation and to sinusoidal vertical motion also exhibited little tendency to acquire a conditioned aversion to banana. But monkeys who had sham operations and those who revealed weak-to-strong signs of motion sickness exhibited a marked CFA (significant reduction in food intake). The strength of CFA was much greater when elicited in the test vehicle when compared with response in the home cage. The findings are interpreted as support for a limited application of CFA procedures for inferring the presence of motion-induced nausea and malaise.\r"

  ".W": "An entirely satisfactory solution to dynamic rehabilitation of the paralyzed facial musculature has not yet been found. Recent interest in selective reinnervation of the laryngeal musculature, synchronous with appropriate afferent information, has led us to propose that miniature strain gauges be placed on one or more muscles of facial expression on the intact side to channel electrical signals to the opposite corresponding facial musculature reinnervated via nerve-muscle pedicles. In order to avoid introducing extraneous factors related to facial motion, this principle was first studied on crossover ansa hypoglossi nerve-muscle pedicles in New Zealand white rabbits. Surgery was performed on a total of five animals that were under general anesthesia with xylazine and ketamine, through a midline neck incision. The animals were reexplored after 12 weeks, and after verification that reinnervation had taken place, a vertical incision was made under the external canthus, in order to expose the facial nerve. A miniature strain gauge was then sutured on the facial musculature and connected to a central modulating unit that was, in turn, linked to the nerve-muscle pedicle via a monopolar electrode. Facial wiggle that resulted from direct electrical facial nerve stimulation caused synchronous contraction of all reinnervated strap muscles under study; this was documented on film and through facial and strap muscle activity tracings. Our next step will be to extend this principle to paralyzed facial muscles. If successful, this system could be miniaturized for long-term implantation in human beings.\r"

Over the past few years, two lathyrogenic agents (compounds that inhibit collagen cross-linking) have been shown effective in prevention of stenosis in animal models that have deep caustic esophageal burns. Since the principles of induced lathyrism have not been applied to the treatment of laryngotracheal stenosis, a pilot study using a canine model was conducted to test the efficacy of penicillamine and N-acetyl-L-cysteine in reduction of the rate of reformation of SGS. In all six animals used, a complete, 10 to 15 mm thick, mature SGS was induced experimentally, then opened with a CO2 laser. The dogs that were treated with lathyrogenic agents exhibited a lower rate of re-stenosis (one maintained patency throughout the 5 weeks of treatment) when compared to the two control dogs. Histologic sections of the subglottis in each dog revealed severe cricoid collapse, necrosis, and scarring, and thus demonstrated similarities to SGS in human beings. The two lathyrogenic agents used in this study are already approved for human use and may represent a valuable form of adjunctive therapy in the surgical management of SGS.\r"

Thirty-three patients received the entire protocol and 76 patients received most, but not all, of the protocol drugs. Some improvement of hearing (greater than 10 dB in pure-tone average) was seen in 52% of patients treated with the complete protocol and in 54% of patients who received the partial protocol. All patients were analyzed for potential prognostic indicators. Patients with thresholds at 8000 Hz better than at 4000 Hz fared better than the group as a whole. Vertigo at the time of onset of hearing loss was a sign of poor prognosis. There was no correlation between hearing improvement and the age of the patient or the sedimentation rate. Most importantly, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome between patients treated with the complete protocol and those who received only part of the protocol. Furthermore, when the effect of each drug was examined individually, there was no significant difference between those patients receiving and not receiving treatment. The results suggest that this \"shotgun\" approach for treatment of sudden hearing loss offers no better outcome than is reported in the literature for spontaneous recovery.\r"

Unfortunately, none of these treatments was effective. After Rothendler's case description in 1951, a multitude of papers have appeared that evaluate the effectiveness of steroids in idiopathic facial paralysis. My presentation reflects a close evaluation of 94 of these papers. Only a few properly controlled, randomized, prospective studies were available. Their main conclusion was that steroid treatment was not more beneficial than conventional treatment. To the contrary, several other less valid prospective and retrospective studies suggest that steroid treatment is beneficial. The definitive, statistically valid study concerning the benefits of steroids in treatment of idiopathic facial paralysis has yet to be performed. Until then, treatment of idiopathic facial paralysis continues to be controversial.\r"

The hallmark signs of DKA are a relative or absolute lack of insulin along with acidosis, ketosis, and hyperglycemia. Insulin and fluid and electrolyte therapy are initiated to control the hyperglycemia and prevent shock and further complications. The patient in HHNK presents with a very high serum glucose level (higher than in DKA), a high serum osmolarity, and usually no ketosis or acidosis. The patient may also experience more severe and sudden neurologic changes than those in DKA. Most patients who experience HHNK are older and may also have some other underlying disease process present. The nursing process should be used to correct the fluid and electrolyte imbalances and to prevent further complications in both DKA and HHNK. The patient needs to understand the reasons for his or her hyperglycemic crisis and how to prevent it from occurring in the future. Assessment of the patient's knowledge about diabetes is essential so that proper education can be incorporated into his or her plan of care.\r"

Nursing diagnoses have become the organizing framework for quality assurance, staff development, specialization and consultation, and computer applications. The presence of a professional model of nursing practice facilitated the use of nursing diagnoses. Prior to implementing nursing diagnoses, IVH nurses had defined the scope of nursing practice and formed a committee structure for decision-making by all RNs. The structure included mechanisms for collective and individual accountability. All nurses participated in the decision to use nursing diagnoses in their practice. Each nurse had the opportunity to influence the process of change. The process of implementing nursing diagnoses at IVH continues. Nurses recognize the need to establish the validity of each diagnostic statement. Skill with the diagnostic process is expected to improve. Nurses also recognize the need to test interventions for specific diagnoses. The standard nomenclature will continue to be used for the improvement of nursing practice and for nursing department programming. The use of nursing diagnoses is the basis of the continued development of a professional model of nursing practice.\r"

Recent evidence suggests that G proteins may mediate B-lymphocyte responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and may also transduce signals from the T-cell antigen receptor. Since these receptors are uniquely expressed on lymphoid cells, we used molecular cloning strategies to ask whether lymphocytes contain specialized G-protein alpha subunits to assist in signal transduction. Comparison of our two deduced human alpha i amino acid sequences with those previously determined for bovine and rodent G proteins permits the identification of three closely related but distinct types of alpha i molecules that comprise a small multigene family. Using gene-specific probes, we found that both of our alpha i genes are expressed in most cell types but in differing ratios. Our data support the view that a modest repertoire of extremely closely related G proteins mediates the transduction of signals derived from multiple different receptor molecules.\r"

The levels of expression in the tissues were intestine greater than placenta greater than liver greater than pancreas, and in the cell lines the levels were human erythroleukemia greater than butyrate-induced colon greater than colon greater than brain greater than HeLa cells. mRNA was undetectable in reticulocytes, consistent with our failure to detect positive clones in a size-selected (greater than 2 kilobases) lambda gt11 reticulocyte cDNA library.

  ".U": "88068510\r", 
  ".W": "In mature mouse B lymphocytes, immunoglobulin kappa light chain transcripts contain an intervening sequence separating the recombined variable (V) plus joining (J) exon from the distant constant (C) exon. After V-J recombination, this intervening sequence can include as many as three unused but very similar J-region 5' splice sites. Each of these sites is potentially functional if the gene is appropriately recombined. It is unclear how the splicing machinery distinguishes among these 5' splice sites, always choosing the most upstream site. We used synthetic transcripts of kappa gene sequences containing J3 and J4 in both the germ-line and the recombined configurations to study the pattern of 5' splice-site selection in vitro. We find that both HeLa cell and lymphocyte nuclear extracts fail to discriminate between the J3- and J4-region 5' splice sites. In contrast, after transfection into HeLa cells, similar kappa light chain transcripts are spliced correctly at the most upstream 5' splice site--that which is used in kappa-producing cells. We conclude that accurate 5' splice-site selection in the mouse kappa light chain is neither cell-type- nor species-specific. Potential mechanisms for this controlling step in gene expression are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Cholera toxin (CT) represents a class of ligands that binds preferentially to noncoated pits on the cell surface. In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism of endocytosis of this class of ligand and compared it to the classic coated pit mechanism. When either CT coupled to colloidal gold particles (CT-gold) or 125I-labeled CT were incubated with 3T3 L1 fibroblasts at 4 degrees C, both ligands bound in a preferential fashion to small noncoated pits on the cell surface. CT-gold surface-labeled cells were then incubated at 22 degrees C. The labeled ligand progressively moved into noncoated vesicles and a tubulovesicular compartment composed of a network of tubules and vesicles closely associated with multivesicular bodies but distinct from the Golgi complexes. The ligand next passed into multivesicular bodies. By contrast, alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2m)-gold initially localized preferentially to coated pits and subsequently to coated vesicles and tubulovesicular structures before associating with multivesicular bodies. To directly compare the intracellular pathway followed by CT-gold to that followed by alpha 2m-gold, CT-gold (7 nm) was coincubated with alpha 2m-gold (15 nm). By 10 min of incubation at 22 degrees C, up to 66% of tubulovesicular units contained both ligands when analyzed in serial sections. Subsequently, both ligands were colocalized in multivesicular bodies. We conclude that CT-gold endocytosed via noncoated vesicles and alpha 2m-gold endocytosed through coated vesicles subsequently associate with the same tubulovesicular units, multivesicular bodies, and lysosomes.\r"

  ".W": "Courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster males is an innate behavior pattern. Whether or not a fly will display male courtship behavior is governed by the action of a set of regulatory genes that control all aspects of somatic sexual differentiation. The wild-type function of one of these regulatory genes, transformer-2 (tra-2), is necessary for female sexual differentiation; in the absence of tra-2+ function XX individuals differentiate as males. A temperature-sensitive tra-2 allele has been used to investigate, by means of temperature shifts, when and how male courtship behavior is specified during development. The removal of tra-2ts function in the adult (by a shift of the tra-2ts mutant flies to the restrictive temperature) can lead to the appearance of male courtship behavior in flies that otherwise would not display these behaviors. These experiments suggest that the regulatory hierarchy controlling sexual differentiation is functioning in the adult central nervous system. More importantly, these results suggest that the adult central nervous system has some functional plasticity with respect to the innate behavioral pattern of male courtship and is maintained in a particular state of differentiation by the active control of gene expression in the adult.\r"

In considering evolutionary mechanisms for this curious divergence from the standard genetic code, we propose the existence of progenitor tRNAs for glutamine that can weakly suppress UAA and UAG codons. It has been previously shown that multicopy plasmids that overexpress normal tRNA(CAAGln) and tRNA(CAGGln) genes from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can partially suppress a number of yeast ochre and amber mutations, respectively. In the present study we show that the tRNA(CAGGln) gene can also function as a weak amber suppressor when expressed in cells at physiological levels. This observation is consistent with a role of tRNA(CAGGln) as an evolutionary progenitor of tRNAs that strongly decode UAG codons.\r"

  ".W": "Cell surface expression of class II major histocompatibility complex-encoded (Ia) molecules depends on association of the component alpha and beta chains into a stable heterodimer. In the mouse, two isotypes of class II molecules have been identified, A beta A alpha and E beta E alpha. However, experiments from this laboratory have shown that, following DNA-mediated gene transfer into murine L cells, an A beta E alpha-mixed-isotype molecule can be assembled and expressed at the cell surface. In the present study, we have investigated the structural features of the beta chain that control the extent of association and level of membrane expression of A beta E alpha interisotypic pairs. The use of intact allelic A beta genes demonstrated that only A beta d chains, but not A beta b or A beta k chains, can be coexpressed on the surface membrane with E alpha chains. Transfection of recombinant A beta genes that encode all or half of the beta 1 domain from one allele and the rest of the chain from another allele revealed that the 5-7 polymorphic residues in the amino-terminal 50 residues of the A beta chain completely controlled this variation in expression with E alpha. Isotypically mixed beta genes encoding the A beta 1 domain of either A beta d or A beta k chains and the beta 2, transmembrane, and intracytoplasmic portions of E beta chains were used to assess the role of isotypically conserved structures in alpha beta pairing and expression. In marked contrast to the major alterations in expression accompanying changes in the amino-terminal polymorphic residues, exchange of these carboxyl-terminal isotypic segments had no detectable influence on the efficiency of expression with either A alpha or E alpha chains. These results argue strongly that variations in the efficiency with which distinct Ia alpha beta dimers assemble and are transported to the membrane is determined almost exclusively by a critical chain interaction involving the amino-terminal domains of the molecules.\r"

To determine the potential for gamma gene expression in a set of well-characterized, cloned T-cell lines, we cloned all of the rearranged gamma genes from each cell line. The genes were sequenced to determine if the junction of the variable and joining regions maintained the proper translational reading frame. We then attempted to correlate the presence of an in-frame gamma gene with a T-cell subset. We were unable to establish such a correlation. We found evidence, however, that allelic exclusion influences the rearrangement of the gamma gene. This is consistent with the idea that the gamma gene product participates in establishing a clonally diverse population of T cells recognizing a polymorphic ligand. Isotypic exclusion does not apply to the gamma gene, however, suggesting different roles for the different gamma gene isotypes.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies we have shown that rejection of islet xenografts transplanted between closely related species (rat to mouse) can be prevented by destruction or alteration of antigen-presenting cells in the donor islets and temporary immunosuppression of the recipients. Relatively few studies have been reported on the survival of islet xenografts transplanted between widely discordant species. In the present study, isolated human islets were transplanted beneath the renal capsule of B6 mice made diabetic by the injection of streptozotocin. The effect of culturing the human islets at 24 degrees C for 7 days with or without the administration of anti-L3T4 for 7 days after transplantation was determined. A marked prolongation of the mean survival time was obtained with low-temperature culture alone (greater than 40.2 +/- 9.9 days), with anti-L3T4 alone (greater than 45.2 +/- 6.3 days), and with the combination of these regimens (greater than 51.9 +/- 5.1 days) as compared to controls (7.5 +/- 1.1 days). The surprising finding was the marked effect of low-temperature culture alone on prolonging human islet xenograft survival because this treatment of the donor islets had no effect on the survival of rat islet xenografts. Intact human islets were present in approximately equal to 80% of the recipients after returning to a diabetic state, whereas xenografts of rat islets were completely destroyed. The findings indicate that complete rejection of islets across this widely discordant species barrier is slower than across a closely related barrier and may be occurring by a different rejection process.\r"

The mAb was an IgG1 kappa that inhibited vWF-induced platelet aggregation at a titer of 1:6250 and bound to immobilized vWF at a maximal dilution of 1:512,000. The antibody did not affect two other vWF functions, platelet adhesion and binding of coagulant factor VIII (factor VIII:C). The antithrombotic state was characterized by a prolonged bleeding time and lack of plasma vWF activity, but with near-normal levels of factor VIII:C and von Willebrand antigen. The circulating Ag.mAb complex demonstrated a multimeric distribution comparable to that of native plasma vWF. Three groups of pigs were studied: group A consisted of nine untreated animals, eight of which developed occlusive coronary thrombosis; group B, four treated animals with a long bleeding time, none of which developed occlusive thrombosis; and group C, two animals with preexisting thrombosis treated with mAb, in which stable blood flow was reestablished. Morphologically, the group B animals showed adherent platelets covering the injured intima but no thrombosis. This mAb is an antithrombotic agent that prevents platelet thrombosis without affecting intrinsic platelet function.\r"

  ".W": "When corneal microsomes were incubated with arachidonic acid in the presence of an NADPH-generating system, four polar metabolites (compounds A-D) were formed. Synthesis of these metabolites could be inhibited by carbon monoxide, SKF 525A, and anti-cytochrome c reductase antibodies. One of the metabolites, compound C, was found to inhibit partially purified Na+,K+-ATPase from the corneal epithelium in a dose-dependent manner with an ID50 of approximately 50 nM. After compound C was purified by TLC and HPLC, it was found to have a UV absorption spectrum with a maximum absorbance at 236 nm suggesting the presence of a conjugated diene. Mass spectrometric analysis using positive- and negative-ionization modes was carried out on derivatized compound C that had been synthesized from a mixture of specifically labeled ([5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-2H8]arachidonic acid) and unlabeled arachidonic acid. Abundant fragment ions were consistent with compound C being a monooxygenated derivative of arachidonic acid with a hydroxyl substituent at carbon-12 of the icosanoid backbone; all deuterium atoms from [2H8]arachidonate were retained in the structure. Oxidative ozonolysis yielded products indicating double bonds between carbons at positions 10 and 11 and positions 14 and 15 of the 20-carbon chain. Compound C was, therefore, characterized as a 12-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid. However, only 12(R) isomer was found to be an inhibitor of the Na+,K+-ATPase from the corneal epithelium, suggesting that the biologically active compound C was 12(R)-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-icosatetraenoic acid. Such an inhibitor of Na+,K+-ATPase synthesized in the cornea may have an important role in regulating ocular transparency and aqueous human secretion.\r"

Among different strains of gonococci there is variability of PI, and two main classes, PIA and PIB, have been recognized. A lambda gt11 bank of gonococcal DNA was screened using monoclonal antibodies directed to a PIB-type porin molecule of N. gonorrhoeae, and three immunoreactive clones were isolated. DNA sequence analysis indicated that each contained only portions of the PI structural gene, but that together they contained the complete gene, and its structure was determined. The DNA sequence predicts a protein of 348 amino acids with a typical 19 amino acid signal peptide. The PI protein resembles Escherichia coli porins in size, lack of long hydrophobic sequences, and absence of cysteine residues. Sequence homologies between PI and the E. coli porins were found, particularly in the 100 N-terminal and the 110 C-terminal amino acids. In addition to the coding sequence of PI, the complementary strand contains a large open reading frame. At the 3' end of the PI gene, immediately following an inverted repeat (probably the transcription terminator), the clone contains an unusual sequence consisting of 31 perfect repeats of the heptamer CTGTTTT. Hybridization analysis suggests that there is a single structural gene for PI and that it is homologous to the gene found in a PIA-bearing strain of gonococcus.\r"

This observation supports the hypothesis that all T. brucei mRNAs share a common leader sequence. Digestion of the T2-resistant species with nucleotide pyrophosphatase shows that the capping nucleotide is 7-methylguanosine 5'-monophosphate (pm7G). Additional characterization of the T2-resistant fragment indicates that modifications are present on the first four transcribed nucleotides; the 5' termini of T. brucei mRNAs can, therefore, be described as \"cap 4\" structures. Identical 5'-cap structures are found on the T. brucei spliced leader (SL) RNA; an observation compatible with the hypothesis that the small SL RNA acts as a donor of the SL for the mRNA. However, we find that within a population of purified SL RNAs are species that are capped but incompletely modified. The presence of these unmodified and partially modified species allowed us to analyze the 5' sequence of the SL RNA transcript. The results indicate that transcription begins four nucleotides upstream of the reported 5' end. Therefore, the T. brucei SL transcript is actually 39 rather than 35 nucleotides long. We have also analyzed the capped oligonucleotide of a distantly related Trypanosomatid, Leptomonas collosoma and find it to be identical to that of T. brucei. The potential significance of these results is discussed in light of observations of trypanosome gene expression.\r"

The gene (here designated woxA) was shown to be present in a single copy. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the translation product consisted of 277 amino acid residues with a Mr of 29,306. The comparison of the sequence with that of mature MSP from spinach chloroplasts suggested that the translation product is a precursor whose amino-terminal 28 amino acid residues represent the signal peptide for the protein to cross the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The length of the putative signal peptide was less than half that of the transit peptide for thylakoid-lumenal proteins of higher plants, whereas the structural profile of the putative signal peptide was similar to that of the carboxyl-terminal portion of the higher plant transit peptides. The amino acid sequence of the mature A. nidulans R2 MSP showed rather low homology (48-49%) to higher plant MSPs, but the conserved amino acid residues appeared to be clustered. Five clusters were tentatively assigned, in which the homology values were in a range of 66-70%. Domains essential for the functioning of MSP are expected to be situated in these clusters. It is of note that the two cysteine residues in MSP were conserved, and the disulfide linkage between them may play an important role in maintaining the tertiary structure of MSP.\r"

In addition, it has no sequence homology with the previously characterized follicular fluid inhibins, which are heterodimeric proteins of Mr 32,000 with follicle-stimulating hormone release-inhibiting activity. This protein specifically inhibits the basal secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone, but not that of luteinizing hormone, in the rat anterior pituitary monolayer culture system with a half-maximal effective dose of 2.5-6.0 ng/ml. Another form of the molecule of Mr 32,000 present in much lower concentration in follicular fluid was also isolated. It may differ from the Mr 35,000 form in glycosylation or carboxyl-terminal truncation. We suggest that this compound be called \"follistatin\" to signify its structural difference from inhibin.\r"

  ".W": "Recently we described a full-length cDNA for the human nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Here, we report the chromosomal localization and partial map of the human gene for this enzyme as well as the complete coding sequence for this protein. The nucleotide sequence reveals a single 3042-base open reading frame encoding a protein with a predicted Mr of 113,135. A comparison of this deduced amino acid sequence with the amino acid sequence of three peptides derived from human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase revealed a match of 27 amino acid residues. A computer-derived structural analysis of the enzyme and a search for similarities with other proteins confirmed that the polymerase belongs to a subfamily of DNA/NAD-binding proteins and DNA-repair proteins. Possible Zn2+-binding \"fingers,\" a nucleotide-binding fold, and a nuclear transport signal were noted. Additionally, chromosomal mapping has identified polymerase-hybridizing sequences on human chromosomes 1 (the active gene), 13, and 14 (processed pseudogenes). Using the polymerase cDNA as a probe, we also have detected several DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms in normal humans.\r"

  ".U": "88068597\r", 
  ".W": "The low-energy conformations for a series of peptides based on the sequence of the ras P21 protein from position 55 to position 67 have been computed using conformational energy analysis. These sequences differed at position 61 and contained Gln, Pro, Leu, Lys, and Arg at this position. P21 proteins with Gln, Glu, or Pro at this position do not cause cell transformation at normal levels of expression; proteins with substitutions of at least 14 other amino acids at this position (Leu, Lys, and Arg having been found in tumors in place of the normally occurring Gln-61) do cause malignant transformation of cells in culture. We find that the segments of residues 55-67 from the nontransforming proteins (Gln- or Pro-61) adopt a structure that is energetically unfavorable for the same segment with Leu, Lys, or Arg at position 61. The critical feature of this structure is an alpha-helix from residues 62 to 68. Residue 61 (Gln or Pro) adopts an extended conformation. On the other hand, the segment from transforming proteins can adopt two structures, one all alpha-helical from residue 61 to residue 68 and the other a less-regular, higher-energy structure. The segments from the normal protein can adopt the all alpha-helical structure, a finding that can explain the fact that elevated intracellular levels of the normal protein also cause cell transformation. The results of the calculations suggest that specific changes in the structure of this region can account for the oncogenic effect of the proteins in which substitutions occur.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of the inotropic effect of cardiac glycosides on the heart has long been controversial. Inotropic effects at low concentrations of cardiac glycosides indicate more than one class of receptor or more than one cellular mechanism. In the brain of the rat, high- and low-affinity cardiac glycoside receptors have been shown to be associated with two structurally different isoforms of the catalytic subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase, termed alpha and alpha(+). Evidence is presented here that the high- and low-affinity sites in rat cardiac ventricle are associated with Na+,K+-ATPase catalytic subunit forms similar to the alpha(+) and alpha forms in the brain. Membranes from the rat ventricle contained polypeptides with the electrophoretic mobilities of alpha and alpha(+), which could be stained by isoform-specific anti-Na+,K+-ATPase antibodies on electrophoretic blots. Both polypeptides also displayed Na+-stimulated phosphorylation with [gamma-32P]ATP. Inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity by ouabain demonstrated the presence of both high- and low-affinity ATPases proportional to the presence of the alpha(+) and alpha polypeptides. The ratios of the two isoforms changed with postnatal maturation, paralleling known changes in cardiac physiology and cardiac glycoside sensitivity. Cardiac glycoside sensitivity can evidently be regulated at the level of gene expression by developmental signals.\r"

  ".W": "A mouse monoclonal antibody generated against Drosophila intermediate filament proteins (designated Ah6/5/9 and referred to herein as Ah6) is found to cross-react specifically with centrosomes in sea urchin eggs and with a 68-kDa antigen in eggs and isolated mitotic apparatus. When preparations stained with Ah6 are counterstained with a human autoimmune serum whose anti-centrosome activity has been established, the immunofluorescence images superimpose exactly. A more severe test of the specificity of the antibody demands that it display all of the stages of the centrosome cycle in the cell cycle: the flattening and spreading of the compact centrosomes followed by their division and the establishment of two compact poles. The test was made by an experimental design that uses a period of exposure of the eggs to 2-mercaptoethanol. This treatment allows observation of the stages of the centrosome cycle--separation, division, and bipolarization--while the chromosomes are arrested in metaphase. Mitosis is arrested in the presence of 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol. Chromosomes remain in a metaphase configuration while the centrosomes divide, producing four poles perpendicular to the original spindle axis. Microtubules are still present in the mitotic apparatus, as indicated by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. When 2-mercaptoethanol is removed, the chromosomes reorient to the poles of a tetrapolar (sometimes tripolar) mitotic apparatus. During the following cycle, the blastomeres form a monopolar mitotic apparatus. The observations of the centrosome cycle with the Ah6 antibody display very clearly all the stages that have been seen or deduced from work with other probes. The 68-kDa antigen that reacts with the Ah6 monoclonal antibody to Drosophila intermediate filament proteins must be a constant component of sea urchin centrosomes because it is present at all stages of the centrosome cycle.\r"

PAI1 was localized first to 7cen-q32 and then to 7q21.3-q22 by Southern blot hybridization analysis of a panel of human and mouse somatic cell hybrids with a PAI1 cDNA probe and in situ hybridization, respectively. We identified a frequent HindIII restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the PAI1 gene with an information content of 0.369. In family studies using this polymorphism, genetic linkage was found between PAI1 and the loci for erythropoietin (EPO), paraoxonase (PON), the met protooncogene (MET), and cystic fibrosis (CF), all previously assigned to the middle part of the long arm of chromosome 7. The linkage with EPO was closest with an estimated genetic distance of 3 centimorgans, whereas that to CF was 20 centimorgans. A three-point genetic linkage analysis and data from previous studies showed that the most likely order of these loci is EPO, PAI1, PON, (MET, CF), with PAI1 being located centromeric to CF. The PAI1 RFLP may prove to be valuable in ordering genetic markers in the CF-linkage group and may also be valuable in genetic analysis of plasminogen activation-related diseases, such as certain thromboembolic disorders and cancer.\r"

Cloning and sequencing of the rearranged VH genes from leukemic lymphocytes of three affected siblings showed that two siblings had rearranged VH genes (VHTS1 and VHWS1) that were 90% homologous. The corresponding germ-line gene, VH251, was found to be part of a small (four gene) VH gene family, which we term VHV. The DNA sequence homology to VHWS1 (95%) and VHTS1 (88%) and identical restriction sites on the 5' side of VH confirm that rearrangement of VH251 followed by somatic mutation produced the identical VH gene rearrangements in the two siblings. VHTS1 is not a functional VH gene; a functional VH rearrangement was found on the other chromosome of this patient. The other two siblings had different VH gene rearrangements. All used different diversity genes. Mechanisms proposed for non-random selection of a single VH gene include developmental regulation of this VH gene rearrangement or selection of a subpopulation of B cells in which this VH has been rearranged.\r"

These Lyt-2- L3T4- cells are characterized by lack of expression of determinants recognized by monoclonal antibody J11d, a phenotype characteristic of more \"mature\" functional T cells. This J11d- subpopulation of Lyt-2- L3T4- thymocytes has now been shown to produce significant quantities of interleukin 2 following mitogen stimulation and to express T-cell receptor molecules recognized by monoclonal antibodies KJ-16 and F23.1. Furthermore, culturing of fetal thymus lobes has shown that precursors of this subpopulation of Lyt-2- L3T4- thymocytes are already present in thymus at 14 days of embryonic development and are thus derived from an intrathymic precursor cell. So, within the mouse thymus, phenotypic changes and acquisition of mature T-cell characteristics occur within a subpopulation of cells originally thought of as exclusively \"immature.\"\r"

Phorbol ester and Ca2+ ionophore were used as mitogens. CD3-4-8- thymocytes responded vigorously when stimulated with phorbol ester in the presence of IL-2 or in combination with Ca2+ ionophore. In contrast, unfractionated thymocytes responded weakly when stimulated with either of these mitogens. Surprisingly, however, the stimulation of these populations with either phorbol ester plus IL-2 or phorbol ester plus ionophore induced a high and similar level of IL-2 receptor expression in both thymocyte populations. A similar level of IL-2 secretion in both populations was also obtained when they were stimulated with a combination of phorbol ester plus ionophore. These results suggest that during the maturation process, the majority of thymocytes lose their capacity to be activated by some mitogens, although they maintain their capacity to secrete IL-2 and to express the IL-2 receptor.\r"

Given the paucity of molecular markers available for the identification of neuronal subtypes, the specificity of neuronal loss within the cerebral cortex has been difficult to evaluate. With a panel of four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) applied to central nervous system tissues from AD patients, we have immunocytochemically identified a population of vulnerable cortical neurons; a subpopulation of pyramidal neurons is recognized by mABs 3F12 and 44.1 in the hippocampus and neocortex, and clusters of multipolar neurons in the entorhinal cortex reactive with mAb 44.1 show selective degeneration. Closely adjacent stellate-like neurons in these regions, identified by mAB 6A2, show striking preservation in AD. The neurons recognized by mAbs 3F12 and 44.1, to the best of our knowledge, do not comprise a single known neurotransmitter system. mAb 3A4 identifies a phosphorylated antigen that is undetectable in normal brain but accumulates early in the course of AD in somas of vulnerable neurons. Antigen 3A4 is distinct from material reactive with thioflavin S or antibody generated against paired helical filaments. Initially, antigen 3A4 is localized to neurons in the entorhinal cortex and subiculum, later in the association neocortex, and, ultimately in cases of long duration, in primary sensory cortical regions. mAb 3F12 recognizes multiple bands on immunoblots of homogenates of normal and AD cortical tissues, whereas mAb 3A4 does not bind to immunoblots containing neurofilament proteins or brain homogenates from AD patients. Ultrastructurally, antigen 3A4 is localized to paired helical filaments. Using these mAbs, further molecular characterization of the affected cortical neurons is now possible.\r"

  ".U": "88068663\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that, in addition to being modulated by presynaptic facilitation, the sensory neurons of the gill- and siphon-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia are also capable of being modulated by transient presynaptic inhibition produced by the peptide Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2. These two modulatory effects involve different second-messenger systems: the facilitation is mediated through cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation, and the inhibition is mediated through the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid. To explore the behavioral function of this inhibition, we have carried out a parametric analysis of the effect of tail shock on the siphon-withdrawal reflex. In addition to producing sensitization of the withdrawal reflex, tail shock also transiently inhibits the reflex. The inhibition is produced by relatively weak shock, whereas sensitization is more prominent and may mask the inhibition with stronger shock. Furthermore, inhibition is not observed after habituation training. Cellular studies suggest that the behavioral inhibition is mediated, at least in part, by presynaptic inhibition of transmitter release from the siphon sensory neurons. Moreover, we have identified an interneuron within the left pleural ganglion (LPL16) that shows Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 immunoreactivity, is activated by tail shock, and simulates the presynaptic inhibitory actions produced by tail shock. Therefore, our results suggest that presynaptic inhibition mediated by Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 and its lipoxygenase second messenger contributes to behavioral inhibition of the siphon-withdrawal reflex.\r"

  ".W": "Excessive, abnormal locomotion occurs after a high dose (25-50 mg/kg) of atropine sulfate to rats already akinetic due to catecholamine deficiency from intraventricular administration of 6-hydroxydopamine. This abnormal locomotion involves an abnormal gait sequence [right (R) hindleg (H), left (L) foreleg (F), LH, RF] instead of the normal gait sequence (RH, RF, LH, LF). In such animals atropine progressively (i) decreases hindleg step size, (ii) decreases arching of the trunk, and (iii) increases foreleg step size. These factors combine to change the ratio of front/hind body support. If the body stretches too far and the hindleg step is too small, a given hindleg step supports insufficient weight to remove weight from the ipsilateral foreleg; consequently, the opposite foreleg must execute the next step, producing the abnormal gait sequence. Thus, atropine affects gait sequence indirectly; it acts on at least three variables that affect how body weight is distributed and shifted during locomotion. To maintain stability during such locomotion, gait sequence is appropriately altered.\r"

  ".W": "Normal cyclic menstruation involves a delicate concert of hormonal events, characterized by midcycle ovulation and, if no pregnancy is achieved, menstrual flow. Women's health--and especially their reproductive health and fertility--may be affected by abnormalities in cyclicity or in menstruation. A number of valuable modes of therapy have recently become available. Abnormal cyclicity may be caused by decreased estrogen levels (from exercise, smoking, or eating disorders). Small ovulation induction pumps, which deliver minute physiologic concentrations of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) around the clock, can be used for safe and successful treatment. Increased estrogen levels may also affect cyclicity, and may be suppressed with new GnRH antagonists or stimulated to cyclicity with pure follicle-stimulating hormone. Abnormal menstruation may be caused by intrauterine scarring or fibroids. Outpatient hysteroscopic surgery may successfully and conservatively be used to treat these problems. Today, even women who have been born without a uterus or who have undergone hysterectomy may have a child through a host uterus program. This combines in vitro fertilization of the husband's sperm with his wife's egg with transfer of the embryo into a host who is capable of carrying the pregnancy. Our potential to improve women's reproductive health continues to expand, as some of the recent developments described above for treating abnormalities of cyclicity or menstruation attest.\r"

  ".W": "A number of radiographic and nuclear medicine techniques are available for the assessment of patients suspected of having osteoporosis or at risk for the development of osteoporosis. Spinal radiographs are insensitive indicators of osteoporosis. They can document the presence of metastatic tumors or other lesions that may produce compression fracture. The Singh index assesses the trabecular pattern of the proximal femur. As bone loss occurs, the trabeculae disappear in a definite sequence. Radiogrammetry refers to the measurement of bone and cortical widths in the peripheral skeleton, usually the second metacarpal. The method is low cost and most useful for population studies. It does not reflect early osteoporosis. Photodensitometry entails radiography of a part of a bone with inclusion of a standard reference wedge on the radiograph. The density of the bone is compared with the wedge. In some laboratories, precision is good (1.5 percent) and the radiation dose is low. Peripheral cortical bone is measured primarily, which is a disadvantage. Single photon absorptiometry uses the transmission of 27.5 keV photons emitted from an iodine-125 source to assess bone density. In most instances, measurements of the radial shaft are made, which reflect primarily cortical bone rather than the more reactive trabecular bone. The distal end of the radius and the calcaneus may also be measured; these areas contain primarily trabecular bone. Radiation dose is low (less than 10 mrad), but when cortical bone is evaluated, the results correlate poorly with spinal bone mineral. Thus, the test is an insensitive indicator of spinal osteoporosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ensuring the adequacy of calcium intake is central to any program of osteoporosis control, but it must be considered in the context of the many factors, including other nutrients, diseases, and drugs, which influence calcium absorption, utilization, and excretion. The dietary consumption of calcium by large segments of the U.S. population remains inadequate. More attention must be paid not only to increasing calcium intake, but also to maximizing its availability from food sources and its retention by the body. As individuals age, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain adequate calcium balance; dietary selection must be made with special care for older persons to ensure that all of the nutrients are consumed in sufficient quantities and that neither excessive weight loss nor weight gain occurs.\r"

There are both potential risks and benefits for the concommitant administration of a progestin. Calcitonin has also been approved; however, the need for parenteral administration, the problem of antibody formation, and expense may limit the usefulness of the currently marketed preparations. Calcium has been recommended, but because it is considered a food supplement it has not been submitted to FDA for evaluation of its safety and efficacy as a drug in the treatment of osteoporosis.

No studies are available showing that physicians hold biases about male and female patients that translate into different communication patterns with each sex. Recent studies of verbal communication between patients and primary health care physicians show that female patients tend to ask more questions than men. Evidence that physicians are more likely to withhold information from female patients is not conclusive. Some evidence has been found that female physicians interrupt their patients less often than male physicians, provide more verbalizations of empathy, and provide clearer explanations in response to patients' concerns. Female physician-patient dyads might be expected to improve communication under certain circumstances.\r"

  ".W": "Communication barriers between health care providers and older women are multifaceted and complex. The acute care, hospital-based orientation of the health care system tends to bypass the characteristic problems of older women who need services. Breakdown in communication originates both with the provider and the recipient. Some inherent changes of aging due to sensory loss may be a major factor. Decline in vision, hearing, and touch make communication difficult for both parties. Other deficits may occur due to disease processes such as diabetes and hypertension. A frequently ignored problem is that of the language barrier between laywomen and physicians. Use of jargon and a nonempathic interviewing style by the doctor tend to discourage free exchange of information. A third consideration is the many psychosocial factors which affect the behavior of older women and their relationship with providers. One element is the belief in negative stereotypes of women in general, and older women in particular. Fear of being labeled a \"hypochondriac,\" a \"nuisance,\" or a \"crabby old woman\" inhibits accurate reporting by patients. Attitudes toward doctors, especially male doctors, make some older women timid and fearful. Physician and patient alike may accept signs and symptoms of disease as a normal part of aging and may cause medically treatable problems to be overlooked. Finally, patient and physician priorities may differ widely. The belief by either party that wellness, prevention, and health promotion are not realistic goals for the older women may push the individual patient into premature frailty and disability which could otherwise be postponed.\r"

Atherosclerosis occurs more commonly in men than women; generally women are 10 to 15 years older than men when symptoms develop. The prevalence of hypertension is about equal in the two sexes, particularly in middle aged and older persons. These cardiovascular diseases are major causes of death and disability in this country. Atherosclerosis results in myocardial infarction, thrombotic strokes, and claudication. Hypertension, when severe, damages small blood vessels, causing kidney failure, hemorrhage, strokes, and heart failure; when the condition is mild to moderate, it produces atherosclerosis. Nutritional factors are of primary importance in both atherosclerosis and hypertension. Risk factors for atherosclerosis related to nutrition are hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia-diabetes, and for hypertension, obesity, high salt intake, and excessive use of alcohol. Of all these risk factors, obesity seems to be the most important because it is strongly linked to hypertension and diabetes. Dietary intake of saturated fat is a potent factor in determining the blood cholesterol level, and reducing intake often decreases the level, thus lessening the risk of atherosclerotic complications. Although high salt intake and excessive alcohol use produce hypertension in susceptible people, less is known about the frequency of this adverse effect than is known about obesity.\r"

  ".W": "Obesity is not a single disease, but a variety of conditions resulting from different mechanisms and associated with various types and degrees of risks. To determine who should lose weight, how much weight should be lost, and how to undertake weight loss, the following types of information are needed: personal-demographic data, developmental patterns, family history, energy balance, body composition/fat distribution, psychological/behavioral measures, endocrine/metabolic measures, complications and associated conditions. Weight reduction should be undertaken by women with morbid obesity, with complications secondary to the obesity, with a strong family history of conditions associated with obesity, or with increased abdomen:hip ratios. In contrast, women who have excess weight localized in the hips and thighs and no personal or family history of associated conditions may not benefit from dietary restriction. Low calorie diets result in adaptive changes, \"designed\" to prolong survival in the face of famine. These include changes in water balance, metabolic rate, and appetite. Metabolic rate declines, allowing the individual to burn fewer and fewer calories. Each time a woman diets she tends to lose weight less rapidly than the time before. \"Restrained eating\" predisposes binge eating. Indeed, bulimia rarely occurs in the absence of prior caloric restrictions. Current medical definitions of obesity do not consider these nuances. Existing definitions \"over-diagnose\" obesity in women, in general, and in older women and nonwhite women, in particular. For example, by existing standards, more than 60 percent of black women more than 45 years of age are considered obese. In contrast, the health risks of similar degrees of obesity are substantially greater for men than for women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fourteen of the 40 conditions described in the report mention nutrient changes or weight maintenance. Twelve other conditions have been added to the list. Four categories of women, based on their roles, are used to discuss major nutrition issues. The youth role focuses on body image and preoccupation with weight control. The childbearer role emphasizes the demand and burden of pregnancy because the outcome of pregnancy is linked with many behaviors during pregnancy. The menopausal woman role is that of the older woman and the health consequence of life-long dietary habits and the frequent \"victim\" position to which she is relegated when using the health care system. The gatekeeper role sends messages to the marketplace through demand and directs purchases for the home. Choosing from 13,000 items makes it possible to regularly choose foods which are inadequate in meeting daily vitamin and mineral needs and can lead to use and abuse of supplements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The rates of all of these disorders, except for cognitive impairment, are lower for older than for younger women. The rates of psychiatric disorders in older women are higher than in older men, except for alcohol abuse-dependence, which is higher in men. Depression is a common psychiatric problem in older women. The differential diagnosis includes other medical disorders, drug effects, normal grief, and early dementia. Older depressed women may present with physical complaints rather than complaints of depression, and thus be misdiagnosed. Treatment consists of psychotherapy, antidepressant medication, and activities to improve self-esteem. Dementia affects 4 percent of elderly women over age 65, and 20 percent of those over age 85. The most common cause is Alzheimer's disease. Current research is focusing on abnormalities in the cholinergic system in the brain. A careful psychiatric evaluation may identify medical conditions, including depression, which can be treated and can lead to improvements in the patient's functioning.\r"

Recent data show that men outnumbered women in drug treatment admissions for all drugs except tranquilizers. However, the 1984 National Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area Survey shows drug abuse and dependence to be the second most commonly reported disorder for women. Smoking is the most common form of drug dependence in our society, and it has a major impact on women's health. Lung cancer is now the leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Smoking poses a special risk of coronary heart disease for women using oral contraceptives. The incidence of emphysema among women has also risen sharply. Smoking during pregnancy carries special, serious risks. Research strongly suggests that the use of marijuana during pregnancy carries significant risks, including low birth weights and fetal abnormalities. Opiate addiction among women is uncommon, but it carries disproportionate health risks for these women and their offspring; infants born of addicted mothers have much higher morbidity and mortality rates than infants in general. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a grave risk to women using intravenous drugs and to their children. There are a number of health problems associated with psychoactive drug use among elderly women. In addition to research, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has focused a number of its activities on the special problems and needs of women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The sex differential in mortality has been increasing since the early 1900s, especially for those 15-24 and 55-64 years of age. Since 1970, however, that trend has slowed for persons 45-74, and for the first time, the sex differential among those 55-64 was actually smaller in 1980 than in 1970. While women have lower age-specific death rates than men for most causes of death, among adults 65 years old and older, the leading causes of death are the same for men and women: heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Despite their continuing mortality advantage, women generally experience more illness than men. They report more self-perceived poor health up to age 60. It has been frequently suggested that women may be more willing to acknowledge and report illness than men. Sex differences in illness among the elderly persist, however, when physical examinations are used for assessment of population-based samples. Injuries, one of the few conditions more common among men, are more common among women after age 55. Among the elderly, women appear to have more conditions that are disabling, such as arthritis, while men have more life-threatening conditions, such as heart disease. Women also use more health services than men, and they are institutionalized more frequently in their later years. Future health service planning must take into consideration women's greater health service needs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 1986, 49,000 women were diagnosed as having lung cancer; only 16 percent of them will survive 5 years or more. Cigarette smoking is unquestionably the leading contributing factor. Large numbers of women took up cigarette smoking during and after World War II. The grim aftermath has taken 20 years to surface--between 1950 and 1985, lung cancer deaths in women increased 500 percent. Even worse, statistics to the end of this century will show no improvement because of the large number of teenage girls and young women now smoking. Unfortunately, efforts at early diagnosis have usually been ineffective. By the time a chest X-ray reveals an abnormality, the patient is usually incurable. Surgery is currently the primary treatment, but is applicable only to those few women in whom the cancer has not spread and who are otherwise acceptable surgical candidates. Scientists are studying chemotherapy and immunotherapy for treatment, as well as exploring the possible preventive effects of various vitamins and minerals. The results of these latter studies will not be available for many years. It is estimated that people who stop smoking must allow 15 years for their risk to return to that of nonsmokers, but if every American woman gave up smoking today, by 2017 lung cancer in women might once again be a medical rarity.\r"

Seventy-eight percent of all children with AIDS are black or Hispanic, as are 71 percent of all women with AIDS. In the black and Hispanic communities, intravenous (IV) drug abuse is associated with much of the AIDS transmission, and parenterally acquired infections are spread secondarily by sexual and perinatal transmission. Almost two-thirds of black and Hispanic persons with AIDS in the United States reside in New York, New Jersey, or Florida. Important differences in the understanding of AIDS and human immunodeficiency virus infection and control measures in minority communities must be considered in devising information and intervention programs for those communities. Programs intended specifically for minorities, especially greatly intensified prevention and treatment of IV drugs abuse, are needed to supplement programs aimed at the U.S. population in general. Combatting AIDS offers black and Hispanic populations an opportunity to greatly reduce IV drug abuse, other sexually transmitted diseases, and teenage pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Where environmental contaminants pose potential health hazards, health departments are involved in complex and often controversial situations. Often the rapid formation of a threshold exposure level is required to protect public health. A decision making process was implemented in Vermont when it became necessary to have an interim ambient air exposure level to test for tetrachloroethylene contamination in the water, air, and soil of a community. Contamination of public and private drinking water and ambient air in schools and homes was discovered as a result of uncontrolled waste disposal from an industrial uniform laundry and drycleaning plant. A telephone survey was conducted to determine action taken by the other 49 States regarding emission standards for tetrachloroethylene into ambient air. There were no guidelines in 25 States, and there were guidelines in the remaining 25. Vermont's Commissioner of Health convened a multidisciplinary group of public health professionals to review various approaches to the establishment of an ambient air standard. A decision making action using modified Delphi and nominal group consensus methods set the interim standard at 67 micrograms per cubic meter in ambient air. The drycleaning plant had been closed voluntarily before the standard was established, and the interim standard was used to prevent reopening of the plant through a health order issued by the Vermont Health Department. The standard was also useful for guidance during environmental remediation.\r"

Certain programs, such as the National Health Service Corps, have recently pulled back from their points of maximal impact in terms of numbers of obligated physicians in the field. This change leaves a need for greater contributions by State and local entities in the face of Federal retrenchment. The health service district (HSD) is one such mechanism for filling the gap. It has been available under this name in Arizona law since 1977, but the first such district in the State in only now under development in a small copper mining community. Similar to school districts in concept, the HSDs allow residents in their catchment areas to tax themselves for the purpose of delivering primary health care. Two successful HSDs--or similar entities--in other States are described. One program is in Stickney, IL, and other in Condon, OR. The political success and financial viability of the Condon program are documented.\r"

The subjects were 116 asymptomatic homosexual men who participated in another study (an examination of behavioral and demographic determinants of HIV antibody status). The subjects were asked to complete two questionnaires. The first contained demographic and sexual behavior questions. The second, administered an average of 6 weeks later, used a subset of the questions in the first questionnaire. The reliability of the test-retest procedure was measured by the Kappa statistic, which assesses the proportion of agreement between two data items, accounting for the amount of agreement expected by chance. The highest degree of reliability as measured by Kappa was found with demographic information, smoking history, and sexual orientation. Self-reported sexual behaviors for the previous 6 months generally had the next highest degree of reliability as measured by Kappa. Questions examining change over the previous 5 years had the lowest reliability. Behavior changes during the time between questionnaires, subjectivity of the answer categories, and social desirability of the answers are three factors that may result in a lack of reliability in this self-reported sexual behavior questionnaire. This raises methodological concerns about the measurement of behavioral risk factors for AIDS and the ability to assess meaningfully subjective reports of behavioral change.\r"

  ".W": "Anecdotal evidence indicates that the cigarette industry is targeting the sale of specific brands, notably menthol cigarettes, to black consumers. This paper presents data on the types of cigarettes smoked by white and black smokers. The cigarette brand preferences of two populations of smokers were examined. The first comprised 70 white and 365 black adult smokers seen at the Deaconness Family Medicine Center located in Buffalo, NY. The second population included 1,070 white and 92 black smokers who called a Stop Smoking Hotline in Buffalo. The results showed that, in both populations, blacks were twice as likely to smoke mentholated cigarettes compared with whites. In an attempt to evaluate the targeting of cigarette ads to black smokers as a possible explanation for black-white differences in brand preferences, cigarette ads appearing in magazines targeted to predominantly white or black readers were compared. Cigarette ads appearing in seven magazines were reviewed, four directed to predominantly white readers (Newsweek, Time, People, Mademoiselle) and three with wide circulation among black audiences (Jet, Ebony, Essence). The results showed that the magazines targeted to black readers contained significantly more cigarette ads and more ads for menthol brand cigarettes than magazines similar in content but targeted to white readers. The observation that a higher percentage of blacks smoke menthol cigarettes than do whites is consistent with the findings regarding differences in the type of cigarette ads appearing in magazines intended for black or white readers. However, it is not possible to determine from this study whether cigarette advertising is the cause of the differences in preference of cigarette brands between white and black smokers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Results of molecular and pathogenic studies of three different bacterial hemolysins (cytolysins) are presented. These exoproteins derive from the two gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Aeromonas hydrophila and from the gram-positive pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. The hemolysin of E. coli is determined by an 8-kilobase (kb) region that includes four clustered genes (hlyC, hlyA, hlyB, and hlyD). This hemolysin determinant is part either of large transmissible plasmids or of the chromosome. The genes located chromosomally are found predominantly in E. coli strains that can cause pyelonephritis and/or other extraintestinal infections. A detailed analysis of the chromosomal hyl determinants of one nephropathogenic E. coli strain revealed the existence of specific, large chromosomal insertions 75 kb and 100 kb in size that carry the hly genes but that also influence the expression of other virulence properties, i.e., adhesion and serum resistance. The direct involvement of E. coli hemolysin in virulence could be demonstrated in several model systems. The genetic determinants for hemolysin (cytolysin) formation in A. hydrophila (aerolysin) and L. monocytogenes (listeriolysin) are less complex. Both cytolysins seem to be encoded by single genes, although two loci (aerB and aerC) that affect the expression and activity of aerolysin have been identified distal and proximal to the structural gene for aerolysin (aerA). Cytolysin-negative mutants of both bacteria were obtained by site-specific deletion and/or transposon mutagenesis. These mutants show a drastic reduction in the virulence of the respective bacteria.\r"

The key alterations of this syndrome are an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and a diffuse increase in pulmonary vascular permeability, with subsequent formation of protein-rich interstitial and intraalveolar edema, disturbance of alveolar surfactant function, and severe impairment of gas exchange. In a model of blood-free perfused rabbit lungs, all these alterations in pulmonary physiology are mimicked by stimulation of the pulmonary vascular arachidonic acid (AA) cascade: increased pulmonary artery pressure is predominantly caused by the AA cyclooxygenase product thromboxane A2, whereas vascular leakage must be ascribed to the stimulation of the various AA lipoxygenase pathways. This local lipid-mediator system in the pulmonary vasculature is directly triggered by bacterial protein toxins such as Staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytotoxin, which start the AA cascade by serving as nonphysiologic calcium-bypass gates in cellular membranes. Moreover, bacteremia and endotoxemia may be effective via activation of the classical humoral cascade systems and leukocyte stimulation, which are all linked to the AA cascade in the pulmonary circulation as a common final pathway.\r"

Possibilities include methods based on the blocking of over-exuberant intrinsic host responses to LPS and on the neutralization of LPS with pharmacologic agents or passively infused antibodies directed at different parts of the molecule. Evidence exists to support the concept that some LPS-induced (acute-phase) host responses may play a role in protection against LPS.\r"

After stimulation by antigen and accessory cells, L. monocytogenes-specific, L3T4+, class II-restricted T cells produced multiple lymphokines, including interleukin 2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Cloned T cells could help B lymphocytes differentiate into antibody-secreting cells and could activate antimicrobial macrophage functions in vitro. Furthermore, cloned T cells could confer local protection and delayed-type hypersensitivity. Factors produced by cloned T cells in vitro as well as recombinant IFN-gamma induced antibacterial resistance in vivo. After stimulation by recombinant interleukin 2 and infected stimulator cells, L. monocytogenes-specific, Lyt2+, class I-restricted T cells produced IFN-gamma. Cloned T cells were capable of lysing L. monocytogenes-infected macrophages. It was concluded that both helper and cytolytic T-cell functions are relevant to antibacterial immunity.

The guanosine triphosphate analog, GTP gamma S, prolonged the survival of excised calcium channels independently of the presence of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), adenosine triphosphate, cAMP-activated protein kinase, and the protein kinase C activator tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate. A specific G protein, activated Gs, or its alpha subunit, purified from the plasma membranes of human erythrocytes, prolonged the survival of excised channels and stimulated the activity of incorporated channels. Thus, in addition to regulating calcium channels indirectly through activation of cytoplasmic kinases, G proteins can regulate calcium channels directly. Since they also directly regulate a subset of potassium channels, G proteins are now known to directly gate two classes of membrane ion channels.\r"

  ".U": "88070595\r", 
  ".W": "Nuclear oncogene products have the potential to induce alterations in gene regulation leading to the genesis of cancer. The biochemical mechanisms by which nuclear oncoproteins act remain unknown. Recently, an oncogene, v-jun, was found to share homology with the DNA binding domain of a yeast transcription factor, GCN4. Furthermore, GCN4 and the phorbol ester-inducible enhancer binding protein, AP-1, recognize very similar DNA sequences. The human proto-oncogene c-jun has now been isolated, and the deduced amino acid sequence indicates more than 80 percent identity with v-jun. Expression of cloned c-jun in bacteria produced a protein with sequence-specific DNA binding properties identical to AP-1. Antibodies raised against two distinct peptides derived from v-jun reacted specifically with human AP-1. In addition, partial amino acid sequence of purified AP-1 revealed tryptic peptides in common with the c-jun protein. The structural and functional similarities between the c-jun product and the enhancer binding protein suggest that AP-1 may be encoded by c-jun. These findings demonstrate that the proto-oncogene product of c-jun interacts directly with specific target DNA sequences to regulate gene expression, and therefore it may now be possible to identify genes under the control of c-jun that affect cell growth and neoplasia.\r"

  ".W": "Ligand-induced decrease in cell-surface receptor number (homologous downregulation) is often due to rapid receptor internalization. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), however, causes a slow downregulation of TRH receptors (TRH-Rs), with a half-time of approximately 12 hours, in GH3 rat pituitary cells. The mechanism of TRH-R downregulation was studied by monitoring TRH-evoked depolarizing currents in Xenopus oocytes injected with GH3 cell RNA as a bioassay for TRH-R messenger RNA (mRNA) activity. In GH3 cells, TRH caused a rapid decrease in TRH-R mRNA activity to 15 percent of control within 3 hours. Because the half-life of TRH-R mRNA activity in control cells was approximately 3 hours, the rapid decrease in mRNA activity was not due to inhibition of mRNA synthesis alone and may represent a post-transcriptional effect.\r"

Cruzin purified by ion exchange chromatography and high-density lipoprotein isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation inhibited Trypanosoma cruzi neuraminidase to the same extent. Cruzin or high-density lipoprotein restores to normal the decreased multiplication rate of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes grown in a medium depleted of lipoproteins, suggesting that it may be important for survival of the parasite in nature.\r"

Separable factors are also required for the 3' end processing of histone pre-mRNA's. The two conserved signals flanking the 3' cleavage site are recognized by discrete components present in active HeLa cell extracts: the upstream stem loop associates with a nuclease-insensitive factor, while binding to the downstream element is mediated by a component having the properties of a snRNP. The sequence of the RNA moiety of the low abundance human U7 snRNP suggests how the relatively degenerate downstream element of mammalian pre-mRNA's could be recognized by RNA base-pairing.\r"

Renal failure in the patient with jaundice is associated with the presence of bacterial endotoxin in the peripheral blood, and enteric endotoxin absorption is facilitated by the absence of bile salts from the intestine. Oral replacement of bile salts should prevent endotoxemia and renal failure. Forty-six patients with jaundice were studied. Twelve patients received sodium deoxycholate preoperatively, 12 received chenodeoxycholic acid and 22 acted as controls. Endotoxemia was measured by the limulus test and renal function assessed by 24 hour creatinine clearance. No patient given deoxycholate preoperatively had systemic endotoxemia or postoperative impairment of renal function. Endotoxemia was reduced in the chenodeoxycholic acid group, but not significantly, and renal function was not protected. Sodium deoxycholate is undergoing further evaluation in a multicenter randomized prospective study.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine the effects of estrogen and testosterone on baseline and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-stimulated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in rats. Seven groups of 20 rats each were studied: intact males (group I), intact females (group II), castrated males (group III), castrated females (group IV), castrated males with testosterone replacement (group V), castrated females with testosterone supplement (group VI), and intact females with testosterone supplement (group VII). Two weeks after initiation of these hormone treatments, blood samples for TSH levels were obtained before and 10 minutes after TRH injection. Testosterone levels were also determined to verify hormone release. The results of these studies indicated that (1) testosterone has a primary, stimulatory role in the control of TSH concentration in that it causes elevation of both baseline and TRH-stimulated TSH levels, (2) endogenous estrogens have no such direct effect on TSH levels, and (3) in the presence of testosterone, endogenous estrogens partially inhibit the TSH-elevating effect of the androgen. As TSH stimulation is considered requisite for thyroid carcinogenesis, the different effects of testosterone and estrogen on TSH levels, demonstrated in this study, may in part explain differences in incidence and prognosis of thyroid carcinoma observed between the sexes in both rats and human beings.\r"

  ".W": "A double blind, crossover study was undertaken to determine whether non-specific hyperresponsiveness in subjects with asthma was reduced by long term treatment with sodium cromoglycate and, if so, whether this was related to change in lung function. Forty four adult asthmatic subjects (41 atopic, three non-atopic) entered the one year study at intervals staggered over six months. After a baseline period to ensure that asthma control was stable subjects entered the treatment period, during which they inhaled sodium cromoglycate 20 mg four times daily or matching placebo four times daily for 16 weeks each, in random order. Response was assessed at four weekly intervals by measurement of lung function and histamine inhalation tests, from which the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20H) was calculated. The assessment included daily symptom score, morning and evening Airflow-meter readings and treatment; mean values for each treatment period and also for the final four weeks of each period were compared. There were no significant differences between placebo and sodium cromoglycate treatment for PC20H, FEV1, morning or evening flow meter readings, bronchodilator usage, or symptom scores for the group as a whole, for the 16 week period or for the final four weeks of each period. Thirteen subjects showed better morning and evening flow meter readings while taking sodium cromoglycate than while taking placebo and eight better readings with placebo than with sodium cromoglycate (p less than 0.05). Improvement in lung function did not correlate with baseline lung function or baseline PC20H, or with features of atopy. These results suggest that long term sodium cromoglycate treatment does not alter non-specific bronchial responsiveness in adult asthmatic subjects.\r"

To determine the hemorrhagic potential of thrombolytic therapy in experimental cerebral infarction, we compared a group of tissue plasminogen activator-treated rabbits (n = 4) with 2 groups of streptokinase-treated rabbits (n = 6 in each), as well as with 3 groups of heparin-treated rabbits (n = 5 in each) and untreated controls (n = 12). Focal cerebral infarction was produced in rabbits by occlusion of the right common carotid and middle cerebral arteries coupled with 2 hours of halothane-induced hypotension. Treatment with heparin or thrombolytic agents began 24 hours after occlusion. One additional group was treated with streptokinase 1 hour after occlusion (n = 6) to determine the hemorrhagic potential of thrombolytic agents in evolving infarction. Rabbits were killed 29-33 hours after occlusion, and brain sections were examined using light microscopy. The results demonstrate that microscopic hemorrhage is frequently present in infarcted tissue irrespective of treatment. Gross cerebral hemorrhage did not occur in untreated rabbits or in rabbits treated with streptokinase 1 hour after occlusion. Only rabbits treated with streptokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, or excessive doses of heparin 24 hours after occlusion, at a time when cerebral infarction was well established, exhibited gross hemorrhage in the area of infarction. These data suggest that treatment of ischemic stroke with thrombolytic agents carries an increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage unless the agents are given early after the onset of symptoms.\r"

Topical application of hypertonic solutions of NaCl caused leakage of fluorescein. However, putative chemical mediators of leakage, such as histamine, serotonin, arachidonic acid, and bradykinin, all failed to increase permeability to the dye. Apparent increases in permeability only accompanied endothelial damage caused by the dye + light combination, as indicated by production of local platelet aggregates. The technique is useful, provided inadvertent endothelial injury is recognized and avoided. The data in mice suggest that pial vessels may not participate in the permeability changes reportedly produced in parenchymal brain vessels by several of the mediators we tested. Therefore, studies of pial vascular permeability are not expected to provide reliable data concerning the actions of agents that might mediate cerebral edema.\r"

Studies of the time to onset of hemodynamic effects of sublingual NTG suggest that the first detectable effect, on left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, occurs at a mean of 90 seconds after administration. By timing the duration of exertional angina after formal exercise testing, one can show that, on average, chest pain is gone within 2 minutes. Thus, in many patients, it is unlikely that sublingual NTG can further shorten episodes of exertional angina. The value of sublingual NTG is greater when patients exercise beyond the onset of pain, when patients have more protracted episodes of exertional pain and when there is a need to resume immediately the activity that brought on the angina. With respect to angina prophylaxis, the pioneering studies of Parker and co-workers have now been amply confirmed. Continuous nitrate administration by oral, transdermal or intravenous routes results in substantial, albeit incomplete, tolerance. Tolerance occurs even when high plasma concentrations are achieved and persist over time. Tolerance can eliminate responsiveness to sublingual NTG. Preliminary evidence suggests that tolerance to the antianginal effects of NTG at maximal exercise may be more marked than tolerance to the effects of NTG on silent ischemia at submaximal activity levels. The significance of this dissociation in time course and its implications are unclear at this time. Three potential strategies exist for avoiding NTG tolerance in patients with chronic stable angina. Administration of a thiol donor has been shown to reverse some hemodynamic manifestations of tolerance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There is growing evidence to suggest that a primary decrease in coronary blood flow, resulting from increased coronary arterial resistance, is the principal cause for spontaneous symptomatic and asymptomatic myocardial ischemia in these patients. The precise mechanism for increased coronary arterial resistance has not been clarified, and it is likely to be different in different angina syndromes but similar for both symptomatic and asymptomatic myocardial ischemia. Since nitroglycerin and nitrates can decrease coronary arterial tone and coronary artery resistance, as well as myocardial oxygen requirements, these agents have the potential to relieve episodes of silent myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery syndromes.\r"

Many studies and clinical experience indicate that the use of this preparation results in a marked diminution of recurrent angina episodes in most patients. If adverse reactions such as severe hypotension or bradycardia occur, decreasing the dose or stopping it entirely corrects the problem. Intravenous nitroglycerin can be used in combination with other known antianginal agents, such as beta blockers and calcium antagonists. In clinical practice most patients are treated with nitrates and beta blockers or calcium antagonists because the combination of drugs may reduce ischemia and symptoms more than each drug used alone over a long period.\r"

  ".W": "Management of patients after myocardial infarction includes several therapeutic options. Lysis of the coronary thrombosis with intravenous or intracoronary administration of streptokinase or intravenous administration of one of the newer, currently experimental agents, such as tissue plasminogen activation or prourokinase, can directly restore oxygen and substrate delivery to potentially salvageable myocardium. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty can likewise restore vessel patency with potential salvage of ischemic myocardium, if perfused sufficiently early after symptom onset. Another strategy is to administer intravenous thrombolytic therapy and then perform early angioplasty on patients with acute myocardial infarction who reach the hospital within 4 hours of symptom onset. These patients should have intravenous nitroglycerin begun before or simultaneously with beginning thrombolytic therapy. The infusion is titrated to lower systolic arterial pressure by 10% to 15%, and then maintained at a constant rate for up to 48 hours. Patients seen more than 4 hours after symptom onset, with evidence of viable myocardium (e.g., persistent R waves in those electrocardiographic leads demonstrating ST-segment elevation) may also receive intravenous nitroglycerin and thrombolytic or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty therapy. The combined results of the several clinical trials of intravenous nitroglycerin in acute myocardial infarction would support its use in patients seen 4 to 12 hours after onset of symptoms or in patients seen earlier, in whom thrombolytic or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty therapy cannot be utilized.\r"

  ".W": "The systemic vasoconstriction that is characteristic of patients with congestive heart failure involves arteriolar constriction, reduction in arterial compliance and reduction in venous capacitance, all of which contribute to the increased impedance and increased preload that aggravate the hemodynamic abnormality. Nitrates are effective in increasing arterial compliance and venous capacitance and thus have a favorable acute hemodynamic effect in heart failure. Long-term studies suggest that this favorable effect is maintained in response to high dose oral isosorbide dinitrate therapy and that it is associated with relief of symptoms and improved exercise tolerance. When combined with hydralazine, isosorbide dinitrate therapy has been shown in the Veterans Administration study to prolong survival in patients with class II and III congestive heart failure. Therefore, long-term nitrate therapy appears to have an important potential in patients with heart failure. It may now be appropriate to use nitrates not only to relieve symptoms, but also to improve long-term outlook in this syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of organic nitrates are discussed, with particular emphasis on the 3 major organic nitrates currently in use, nitroglycerin (NTG), isosorbide dinitrate and isosorbide-5-mononitrate. After intravenous administration, both NTG and isosorbide dinitrate exhibit large systemic clearances and both nitrates appear to be extensively distributed in vascular and other peripheral tissues. Two pharmacokinetic features appear particularly notable for NTG: there is a significant arteriovenous extraction of the drug, and its systemic clearance is related to cardiac output. Both of these features, plus other evidence, suggest that organic nitrates may be substantially removed from the systemic circulation by the vasculature itself. During nitrate tolerance, plasma drug concentrations remain elevated, but vascular activity is diminished. This apparent paradox might be explainable by a unifying hypothesis of reduced nitrate metabolism during vascular tolerance; thus, in the tolerant state, reduced systemic clearance of the intact drug brought about elevated plasma concentrations, whereas reduced cellular metabolism at the smooth muscle brought about a decrease in vascular activity. The complex relations among plasma kinetics, vascular metabolism and pharmacologic action of organic nitrates are still poorly understood.\r"

  ".W": "The organic nitrates are the most widely used agents in the management of patients with angina pectoris. When initially administered by the oral route, the nitrates produce profound changes in systemic hemodynamics and significant and prolonged improvement in exercise duration. It has been shown that during short periods of regular oral nitrate administration, the hemodynamic, antiischemic and antianginal effects of the nitrates are greatly reduced. Thus, when initially administered, oral isosorbide dinitrate prolongs exercise duration for a period of several hours, but during sustained 4-times-daily therapy, exercise tolerance is improved for only 2 hours after administration. Studies with transdermal preparations of isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin also show improvement during short-term administration for up to 8 hours, but after several days of once-daily therapy, the effects of these agents are similar to placebo. It is apparent that nitrate tolerance is a clinically relevant problem. Although tolerance develops rapidly during nitrate therapy, it is reversed promptly during nitrate-free periods. Oral nitrates maintain their antianginal effects when given 2 or 3 times daily with provision of a nitrate-free period. Studies are currently underway to investigate the effects of intermittent administration schedules with transdermal nitrate preparations.\r"

After a 40 U/kg bolus of heparin, rt-PA was given as a 10-mg bolus followed by a 2-hour continuous infusion of 90 mg in the first hour and 50 mg in the second hour. Nonangiographic signs of reperfusion occurred during treatment (41 +/- 21 minutes) in 35 patients and in 1 other patient about 30 minutes after rt-PA. Three patients had discordant nonangiographic signs of reperfusion, 2 patients had no evidence of reperfusion and 1 patient in cardiogenic shock died before completion of the rt-PA infusion and before reperfusion status could be ascertained. Clinical signs of early reocclusion occurred in 4 of the 36 patients with evidence of reperfusion, 3 of whom were retreated with rt-PA with clinical success in 2. Coronary angiography 10 +/- 8 hours later revealed a patent artery of infarction in 35 patients: 32 with nonangiographic signs of sustained reperfusion, both patients with successfully treated reocclusion and 1 of 3 patients with discordant signs of reperfusion. Angiography revealed evidence of partial reperfusion in the remaining 2 patients with discordant signs, and an occluded artery was found in both patients without any evidence of reperfusion and in both patients with clinical signs of persistent reocclusion. Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 9 patients, 7 were related to procedural trauma and 2 patients required a blood transfusion.

Nevertheless, when they reach adulthood, these differences between SHRs and WKYs are all but abolished, yet hypertension persists in SHRs. The possible mechanisms leading to these changes in SHRs and to the differences seen with advancing age are discussed. Results of micropuncture studies that help elucidate the glomerular hemodynamic adaptations to elevation in systemic blood pressure in young SHRs are also presented. Evidence is advanced suggesting that increased intraglomerular pressure is responsible for the histologic lesions characteristic of untreated severe hypertension. The salutary effects of treatment with vasodilator drugs that reduce intraglomerular pressure are emphasized.\r"

The animals were given hypocaloric feeding. Nutritional assessment included the measurement of changes in muscle mass and changes in visceral protein concentration and plasma lipids. Both serum protein and albumin concentrations decreased for 3 d after mechanical ventilation began but then remained stable. The animals exhibited a marked increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein concentrations after receiving oleic acid. We conclude that previously healthy baboons receiving only dextrose infusion during mechanical ventilation have marked decreases in serum albumin occurring after the lung injury. Decreases in albumin occur very early and may represent pooling of albumin in the lung after the oleic acid injury.\r"

In study B albumin and transferrin concentrations were significantly decreased during the first 12 wk of intervention. A sharp recovery in the transferrin concentrations, however, was observed when a minimal increase in protein intake was allowed in the latter portion of the study.

We showed that patients within GI DRGs could be grouped regarding hospital costs by four clinical variables: intensive care unit or emergency admission, and blood or plasma product consumption. Patients within each DRG with the variable usually had higher total hospital costs, a longer stay in the hospital, a greater number of diagnoses, more outliers, and a poorer outcome than patients without the variables. As the variables accumulated, these differences became more pronounced. This study demonstrated that hospital costs may be stratified within GI DRGs by clinical parameters that occur during the patient's hospital stay. These four variables could identify higher cost patients within a DRG; cost containment could then be directed at these patients with, hopefully, resultant savings.\r"

The effect of long-term treatment with CAPD/CCPD, peritonitis episodes, and dialysate inflow volume on peritoneal kinetics in children was evaluated. Peritoneal kinetic studies (PKSs) were performed in 47 pediatric patients at different times following initiation of CAPD/CCPD. In 18 of these patients, PKSs were repeated up to four times with an unchanged dialysate inflow volume after up to 55 months of CAPD/CCPD treatment. The PKS consisted of a 120-minute dwell with a 1.5% dextrose dialysate solution. Peritoneal clearance, dialysance, and dialysate to plasma (D/P) concentration ratios were calculated after 30, 60, and 120 minutes. The results of the serial PKSs demonstrate stable peritoneal creatinine and urea-N clearance, dialysance or D/P concentration ratios. Furthermore, there was no adverse effect of 32 peritonitis episodes. Finally, inflow volumes correlated directly with clearances of creatinine (P less than .01), urea-N (P less than .001), and potassium (P less than .001), and there was an inverse relationship to the D/P concentration ratios of creatinine (P less than .01), urea-N (P less than .01), potassium (P less than .01), and uric acid (P less than .01). Thus, CAPD/CCPD is a useful and effective long-term treatment modality for pediatric patients. Maximal dialysate inflow volumes should be provided to enhance peritoneal kinetics.\r"

Exercise capacity in the dialysis patients, as measured by duration of exercise, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max), and workload achieved (METS) was approximately 50% of that of the nonuremic volunteers. Four of the dialysis patients were studied on both dialysis (predialysis) and nondialysis days and also at 60% of VO2 max for 30 minutes on a nondialysis day. In these individuals, serum electrolytes, acid-base, and biochemical parameters were analyzed preexercise and at regular intervals following cessation of treadmill exercise. Transient metabolic acidosis and mild hyperkalemia developed after maximal exercise but not after prolonged submaximal exercise. Patients were slightly more acidotic and hyperkalemic on a dialysis day compared to a nondialysis day. Cardiopulmonary performance was similar on both days. These changes in serum electrolytes and acid-base parameters provide documentation of the extent of biochemical changes that develop following exercise in dialysis patients.\r"

  ".W": "Type III glycogen storage disease is caused by a deficiency of glycogen debranching-enzyme activity. Many patients with this disease have both liver and muscle involvement, whereas others have only liver involvement without clinical or laboratory evidence of myopathy. To improve our understanding of the molecular basis of the disease, debranching enzyme was purified 238-fold from porcine skeletal muscle. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the purified enzyme gave a single band with a relative molecular weight of 160,000 that migrated to the same position as purified rabbit-muscle debranching enzyme. Antiserum against porcine debranching enzyme was prepared in rabbit. The antiserum reacted against porcine debranching enzyme with a single precipitin line and demonstrated a reaction having complete identity to those of both the enzyme present in crude muscle and the enzyme present in liver extracts. Incubation of antiserum with purified porcine debranching enzyme inhibited almost all enzyme activity, whereas such treatment with preimmune serum had little effect. The antiserum also inhibited debranching-enzyme activity in crude liver extracts from both pigs and humans to the same extent as was observed in muscle. Immunoblot analysis probed with anti-porcine-muscle debranching-enzyme antiserum showed that the antiserum can detect debranching enzyme in both human muscle and human liver. The bands detected in human samples by the antiserum were the same size as the one detected in porcine muscle. Five patients with Type III and six patients with other types of glycogen storage disease were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Although anti-porcine antiserum detected specific bands in all liver and muscle samples from patients with other types of glycogen storage disease (Types I, II, and IX), the antiserum detected no cross-reactive material in any of the liver or muscle samples from patients with Type III glycogen storage disease. These data indicate (1) immunochemical similarity of debranching enzyme in liver and muscle and (2) that deficiency of debranching-enzyme activity in Type III glycogen storage disease is due to absence of debrancher protein in the patients that we studied.\r"

  ".W": "A monoclonal antibody, 1D8, which recognizes a cell-surface antigen expressed by human chromosome 3 in Chinese hamster-human somatic-cell hybrids, has been produced. Testing of hybrids containing various deletions of chromosome 3 determines that the gene encoding the antigen is regionally localized to 3q (cen-22). This regional mapping is distinct from that elsewhere reported for two other cell-surface antigens assigned to chromosome 3--namely, the human transferrin receptor and the p97 melanoma-associated antigen. In addition, biochemical characterization is different from that elsewhere reported for other chromosome 3-encoded cell-surface antigens. When tested against a panel of rare-phenotype red blood cells, the only cells that failed to react were those of the Rhnull phenotype. The antibody reacts only weakly with homozygous -D- and fetal red cells, in contrast with a previously described antibody, R6A, which does not react with Rhnull cells. Furthermore, R6A does not recognize a cell-surface antigen expressed by chromosome 3 in Chinese hamster-human somatic-cell hybrids. Thus, the monoclonal antibody 1D8 recognizes a previously undescribed cell-surface antigen encoded by human chromosome 3 and not expressed on Rhnull cells. The gene on chromosome 3 regulating expression of this antigen may be that defective in Rhnull disease or may require the normal allele at an unlinked Rhnull locus for expression. Linkage studies will be required to further elucidate this matter.\r"

Despite this constraint, major advances in the suppression of the signs and symptoms of these diseases have been made. Second-line drugs such as methotrexate have gained wide acceptance among rheumatologists and may supplant gold as the major therapy for rapidly advancing rheumatoid arthritis. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), however, remain the first line of treatment for arthritic conditions. In recent years, much has been learned about how the NSAIDs suppress the inflammation and pain of arthritis. Even here, however, several inconsistencies exist with our current understanding. New findings in neurobiology may shed light on some of these puzzling features. Although the number of NSAIDs currently available seems a bit overwhelming, rationale exists for their continued development. Many patients do not have a response to some or all of these agents, with noncompliance because of gastrointestinal intolerance being among the probable causes. New compounds that offer improved safety in this regard are greatly needed.\r"

Results from in vitro studies indicate that, in addition, some of these compounds affect proteoglycan metabolism of articular cartilage. Data from in vivo studies suggest that salicylate administration may accelerate articular cartilage damage in several animal models of osteoarthritis. At in vitro concentrations comparable to those that are achieved in the synovial fluid of patients treated with the drug, several NSAIDs suppress proteoglycan synthesis by the chondrocyte. Salicylate has been shown to inhibit the enzymes involved in the early stages of chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis. These NSAID-related effects on chondrocyte metabolism appear unrelated to inhibition of prostaglandin synthetase, and are much more profound in osteoarthritic cartilage than in normal cartilage, due to enhanced uptake of NSAIDs by the osteoarthritic cartilage. Depletion of matrix proteoglycans appears to be a major factor in the increased vulnerability of chondrocytes in degenerating cartilage to effects of NSAIDs. Some NSAIDs may be bound to matrix components. If similar changes occur in the cartilage of patients with arthritis treated with NSAIDs, despite the symptomatic improvement that these drugs produce, cartilage degeneration could be accelerated.\r"

The abilities of SAMe and misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, to protect the gastric mucosa against necrosis induced by various noxious stimuli (ethanol, aspirin, stress) were also compared in standardized, experimental rat models. Pretreatment with SAMe or misoprostol significantly and to the same extent reduced gastric mucosal injury. The experiments described herein indicate that SAMe, a molecule used for the treatment of osteoarthritis, can exert a gastric cytoprotective effect in animals. As preliminary data have shown that this effect may also be reproduced in humans, SAMe seems to provide a therapeutic advantage, in contrast to currently available nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.\r"

  ".W": "In this segment of a multicenter study, 36 hypercholesterolemic patients were randomly assigned to fenofibrate or placebo treatment to assess effects on plasma concentrations of lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol subfractions, and apolipoproteins E, B, Al, and All. All of these factors are of known or potential value in determining the patient's risk of arteriosclerosis. Observations were made during initial screening and placebo phases, a 24-week, double-blind treatment phase, and a subsequent 24-week, open-label fenofibrate phase. There were three possible expressions of fenofibrate efficacy. Changes in lipoprotein cholesterol and total triglyceride concentrations observed in these patients were very similar to those seen with the larger multicenter cohort: total triglyceride levels decreased 38 to 46 percent, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased 13 to 20 percent, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased 4 to 13 percent. Triglyceride concentrations were significantly reduced (p less than 0.01) in very low-density lipoprotein (50 to 56 percent, similar to those of total triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (17 to 21 percent). A slight but statistically insignificant decrease in high-density lipoprotein triglyceride was observed (9 to 15 percent). High-density lipoprotein2 cholesterol levels did not change significantly, whereas high-density lipoprotein3 cholesterol levels increased 8 to 16 percent, accounting for all of the increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Apoprotein All levels increased significantly (13 to 20 percent) whereas those of apolipoprotein Al did not, consistent with an increase in high-density lipoprotein3 levels, where apolipoprotein All is more abundant relative to apolipoprotein Al than in high-density lipoprotein2. Apolipoprotein B levels decreased 20 to 26 percent and those of apolipoprotein E went from 29 to 34 percent, relative to the 16 to 20 percent decreases in very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Five patients with combined elevations of triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol treated with fenofibrate, had reductions primarily in triglyceride, total apolipoprotein E (50 percent reduction), and apolipoprotein B (18 percent) levels. High-density lipoprotein3 cholesterol levels increased 19 percent and high-density lipoprotein2 cholesterol levels were unchanged. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels declined slightly in four patients and a slight rise was observed in a fifth patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Lactoferrin concentration in mucus was highest just after menses (62.9 to 218 micrograms/mg of protein) and lowest (3.8 to 11.4 micrograms/mg of protein) just before menses. Overall concentration of mucus protein showed no variation with menstrual cycle, and little lactoferrin was detectable in cell debris. Plasma lactoferrin did not show the variation seen in vaginal mucus. Because of the suggestion of hormonal influence on vaginal lactoferrin, its concentration was determined in women receiving oral contraceptive therapy. Mean lactoferrin concentration in women taking oral contraceptives was significantly lower than in the control group (never exceeding 19.8 micrograms/mg of protein) and showed no monthly variation. Vaginal lactoferrin appears to be under hormonal control. Variation in vaginal lactoferrin concentration may result in alterations in susceptibility to bacterial pathogens such as Neisseriae gonorrhoeae.\r"

As many as 20 W of power was transmitted through the fiber; however, carbon dioxide gas flow rates as high as 2000 cc/min reduced power by approximately 25%. Replaceable tips preserved fiber integrity to the extent that a single fiber could be reused repeatedly and gas sterilized without jeopardizing laser transmission. Of the 12 cases, endometriotic implants were vaporized in eight women, adhesiolysis was performed in four women, endometrial cysts were drained in two women, and vaporization of myomata was accomplished in two patients. The fiber was also used as a manipulating instrument and could be internally bent with a grasping forceps to better site the laser beam on a lesion. No complications related to the use of the carbon dioxide laser fiber were observed. The safety aspects of carbon dioxide laser fiber technology are not inconsiderable and could provide laser laparoscopy with an extra margin of security.\r"

In sheep, fetal plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide are significantly greater than maternal levels, but the factors that control fetal release of atrial natriuretic peptide have not been defined. The present studies were conducted to determine whether the fetus responds to increased intravascular volume by atrial natriuretic peptide secretion. The mean (+/- standard error of the mean) atrial natriuretic peptide of basal fetal plasma (115 +/- 24 pg/ml) in chronically catheterized ovine fetuses (131 +/- 1 days' gestation) was significantly greater than atrial natriuretic peptide levels of basal maternal plasma (56 +/- 12 pg/ml). In response to successive 30-minute intravenous infusions of 0.9% saline solution at 0.5 and 1.0 ml/kg/min, fetal plasma atrial natriuretic peptide significantly increased to a maximum of 409 +/- 72 pg/ml during the high-dose saline infusion and returned to 234 +/- 83 pg/ml during a 30-minute recovery period. The increase in fetal plasma atrial natriuretic peptide was significantly correlated with the volume of saline solution infused (r = 0.68). During the saline infusion, a significant increase in fetal blood volume and heart rate was noted. Fetal blood pressure, maternal plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide, and fetal and maternal plasma osmolality remained unchanged. Despite elevated basal levels of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, the third-trimester ovine fetus responds to increases in intravascular volume with a further increase in atrial natriuretic peptide secretion.\r"

  ".W": "alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO; eflornithine), an inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, was used to treat 14 patients with late stage gambiense sleeping sickness, 12 cases having been previously treated with and considered refractory to melarsoprol. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine was administered intravenously at a dose of 400 mg/kg/day for 14 days followed by oral treatment, 300 mg/kg/day, for 21-28 days. In all patients treatment was associated with rapid disappearance of trypanosomes from body fluids (in several cases within 24 hr) and decreased cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell counts. In all but one patient, who died of a pulmonary infection during treatment, alpha-difluoromethylornithine produced a dramatic reversal of clinical signs and symptoms of the disease. Determination of drug concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of 5 patients demonstrated that alpha-difluoromethylornithine diffuses into the central nervous system with cerebrospinal fluid levels representing up to 51% of corresponding serum concentrations. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and anemia were the most frequent side effects associated with therapy, but were reversible and did not necessitate discontinuation of treatment. Four patients have been followed for more than 2 years post-treatment without evidence of relapse.\r"

The pregnant mice were killed on day 17 of pregnancy. Comparisons of the two pregnant groups showed significant differences in fetal weights and x18 magnified ossification lengths of radius and cubitus, whereas placental weights were not modified. The results indicate that intrauterine growth retardation occurs during chronic murine T. cruzi infection. No difference was noted between the reproductive capacities of the two pregnant groups. Parasitemias were similar in infected pregnant and control groups. Mice of all groups survived infection until killing. Pregnancy, therefore, does not influence chronic murine T. cruzi infection. Parasites were never found in fetal blood, indicating a very low, if any, frequency of transplacental transmission of parasite during the chronic phase of infection.\r"

  ".W": "Vaccination of mice with attenuated cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni induces specific acquired resistance to challenge infection. This resistance is immunologically-mediated, possibly via a delayed-type hypersensitivity. Studies of parasite migration have shown that the protective mechanism operates most effectively in the lungs of vaccinated mice. We have probed the mechanism by exposing mice to 500 rads of gamma radiation before challenge infection. Our results show that the effector mechanism operative against challenge larvae is resistant to radiation. In contrast, classical immune responses are markedly suppressed by the same treatment. While leukocyte populations in the blood fall dramatically after irradiation, numbers of cells recoverable by bronchoalveolar lavage are unaffected. We suggest that vaccination with attenuated cercariae establishes populations of sensitized cells in the lungs which trigger the mechanism of resistance when challenge schistosomula migrate through pulmonary capillary beds. Although the cells may be partially disabled by irradiation, they remain responsive to worm antigens and thereby capable of initiating the elimination mechanism. This hypothesis would explain the radiation resistance of vaccine-induced immunity to S. mansoni.\r"

IFA tests utilizing specific antisera to rat IgG (Fc) and rat IgG (Fab) fragments, indicate that some unaltered rat IgG to R. typhi were present in the hemolymph of immune fed fleas. Host antibody to R. typhi was detected on the surface of the rickettsiae in the flea hemolymph and gut contents by IFA. Maintenance of infected fleas on immune host had no significant effect on the establishment and subsequent growth of rickettsiae within the fleas.

A total of 1,208 captures of 762 rodents provided 984 individual blood samples. The antibody prevalence, as determined by frequency of reciprocal indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titers greater than or equal to 32, was 33.9% in rats (Rattus norvegicus, n = 466), 28.3% in meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus, n = 67), 1.4% in house mice (Mus musculus, n = 146), and 1.2% in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus, n = 83). Populations of all rodents were maximal during the fall and winter months, but population trends were not clearly associated with periods of virus transmission. The mean incidence of seroconversion to a Hantavirus for rats was 12.06/100 rats/month, but incidence rates could not be established for other species. Rats which seroconverted were generally sexually mature animals, and there was evidence of transmission throughout the year. Animals which seroconverted to a Hantavirus achieved high IFA titers, and remained seropositive for the duration of the study.\r"

The alfentanil plasma concentration [ALF] vs anesthetic effect relationship has been determined for humans undergoing surgery. This study was designed to determine the [ALF] vs anesthetic relationship for alfentanil in the enflurane-anesthetized dog and thereby to provide data by which the [ALF] vs anesthetic effect relationships in the dog and in humans could be compared. Mongrel dogs (n = 10) were anesthetized with enflurane, and enflurane MAC (EMAC) was determined in each dog. After this, each dog received at least three incremental infusions of alfentanil using infusion rates of 0.625, 1.6, 8, 32, or 80 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. EMAC and [ALF] were determined during each infusion rate. There was a linear increase in [ALF] produced by incremental infusions of alfentanil (r = 0.999). Administration of alfentanil produced a dose-dependent reduction of EMAC up to a maximum of 72.5 +/- 3.7% (mean +/- SEM) at 32 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 ([ALF] = 960 +/- 86 ng/ml); a ceiling effect was evident. The degree of EMAC reduction (69%) produced by an infusion rate of 8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 ([ALF] = 223 +/- 13 ng/ml) was not statistically different from the EMAC reductions produced by infusion rates of 32 (73% reduction at [ALF] = 960 +/- 86 ng/ml) or 80 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 (70% reduction at [ALF] = 2613 +/- 247 ng/ml) (P greater than 0.05). The relative potency of alfentanil was one-seventh to one-tenth that of fentanyl studied under identical conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Side effects included pruritus (3/15), nausea and vomiting (5/15), drowsiness (10/15), and urinary retention (1/11). No apnea was observed. Periosteal analgesia and ventilation were studied in eight of the children (mean age 8.6 +/- 0.8 yr). There was significant periosteal analgesia of the tibia (30, 60, 90, and 120 min after injection) and of the radius (60, 90, and 120 min after injection). Resting respiratory rate and tidal volume did not change during the study. Resting minute-ventilation decreased from 6.3 +/- 0.5 l.min-1 preoperatively to 5.6 +/- 0.6 l.min-1 (P less than 0.05) postoperatively, before epidural sufentanil injection; it did not decrease further after epidural sufentanil. Similarly, end-tidal CO2 tension increased significantly from 37.2 +/- 0.7 mmHg preoperatively to 39.9 +/- 1.2 mmHg (P less than 0.05) postoperatively, before epidural sufentanil; epidural sufentanil did not cause a further significant increase in end-tidal CO2 tension. The slope of the CO2 ventilatory response curve decreased significantly from 1.68 +/- 0.12 l.min-1. mmHg-1 preoperatively to 1.10 +/- 0.13 l.min-1.mmHg-1 (P less than 0.01) postoperatively.

In healthy subjects, mean 5-hour urinary excretion of mannitol was 14.11% and of lactulose 0.26%. In the fasting state, the 60 patients with food allergy exhibited a mean urinary recovery of mannitol of 13.22%, not significantly different from that in healthy subjects. Mean recovery of lactulose in the patients with food allergy was 0.55%, significantly greater than in the healthy patients. After ingestion of food allergens by the patients, mean mannitol recovery fell to 11.57% and mean recovery of lactulose rose to 1.04%, both values being significantly different from those obtained in the fasting patients. On challenging the patients after they had taken sodium cromoglycate, mean mannitol and lactulose recoveries (13.53% and 0.62%, respectively) were not significantly different from those in fasting patients but were significantly different from those obtained on challenging patients unprotected by sodium cromoglycate. Evaluation of intestinal permeability in this way provides an objective means of diagnosing food allergy and assessing the effectiveness of anti-allergic agents such as sodium cromoglycate.\r"

After a distribution phase, infused A1Pl left the bloodstream with a half-life of 103 +/- 24 h. Analysis of plasma antiprotease activity demonstrated preservation of function of the infused A1Pl. Lavage fluid A1Pl concentration and activity were significantly increased 24 h after infusion. Gamma camera scans demonstrated that lung, liver, and spleen acquired 131I-A1Pl similarly; radioactivities per gram of tissue of these organs were similar at autopsy. Excretion of desmosine did not decrease from a baseline of 157 +/- 59 nmol/24 h after A1Pl infusion, indicating no effect of A1Pl infusion on background elastolysis.

When the subjects were treated with placebo, verapamil, or cromolyn, FEV1 markedly decreased and airway responsiveness increased after exposure to TDI. By contrast, beclomethasone prevented the late asthmatic reaction and the associated increase in airway responsiveness to methacholine induced by TDI. Slow-release theophylline partially inhibited both the immediate and the late asthmatic reactions but had no effect on airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. These results suggest that only high-dose inhaled steroids can completely block TDI-induced late asthmatic reactions.\r"

  ".W": "Lung injury induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) is closely associated with toxic oxidants released from activated granulocytes. But the major toxic oxidant causing lung damage is not really known. We have, therefore, conducted investigations using various oxygen radical scavengers. The intravenous administration of dimethylthiourea (DMTU), a potent hydroxyl radical scavenger, or of superoxide dismutase (SOD), a superoxide anion scavenger, plus catalase, a hydrogen peroxide scavenger, to rabbits intravenously injected with PMA prevented biochemical data and cellularity indicative of lung damage in lung lavages. Morphologically, the lungs of PMA-injected rabbits revealed mild interstitial edema, aggregates of granulocytes within the interstitial capillaries, and the increase of granulocytes in alveolar spaces. Furthermore, there was direct morphologic evidence of pulmonary endothelial cell disruption. In rabbits treated with DMTU or SOD plus catalase, there was no evidence of destructive changes in the lungs. SOD-treated rabbits did not show evidence of protection from PMA-induced lung injury. Only a little protection was provided by catalase treatment. Moreover, in the ultracytochemical study for examination of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation, the number of H2O2-generated granulocytes remarkably decreased in lung lavages of catalase-treated rabbits, but destructive changes were observed in the lungs. In contrast, though the number of H2O2-generated granulocyte was not decreased in lung lavages of DMTU-treated rabbits, treatment with DMTU could afford protection from lung injury. These data indicate that the hydroxyl radical, a toxic oxidant derived from stimulated granulocytes, is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of PMA-induced lung injury.\r"

Also, conventional intradermal injections vary in antigen strengths, injection techniques, and subjective evaluations, and are also uncomfortable. This study compared results from three, four, or seven antigens in relation to other nutritional indices. Fifty hospitalized men with cancer were assessed with a 23 item Protein Energy Malnutrition Scale and classified as well nourished (60%) or malnourished (40%). Number of tests did not differ in identifying the malnourished; however, the smaller battery misclassified the normal as malnourished twice as often as the seven tests. Misclassification of normal as abnormal could lead to unnecessary interventions, such as total parenteral nutrition, that increase complications and cost of care dramatically.\r"

Minimal postoperative biochemical changes were noted between the two groups. Postoperative length of stay was longer for GI than GII patients (P = NS). However, septic episodes and mortality were higher (100% vs 40% and 28% vs 10%, P greater than 0.05), respectively, in G1 than in G2 patients. It is concluded that carbohydrate overfeeding may be associated with a high morbidity and mortality.\r"
