Physical examination, clinical history, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were sufficient for diagnosis in most cases. Intravenous pyelography documented ureteral obstruction in two cases. Exogenous estrogen and progestin hormones did not control symptoms. Surgical removal ultimately achieved symptom relief for all women in whom pain was well localized to the remnant, although two patients required two attempts at excision before they were cured. Three patients with more diffuse pain and \"probable\" ovarian remnants were managed medically. Ovarian remnant syndrome is probably more prevalent than is generally appreciated.\r"

Seven rabbits were treated in the lens cortex of one eye with 20 bursts of 4 pulses, 24 mJ each, and followed fluorophotometrically using albumin labelled with fluorescein. This allowed transmission of shock waves to the anterior segment without releasing debris in five eyes that showed no inflammation. Two eyes with inadvertent capsular rupture showed marked blood-aqueous barrier breakdown. This suggests the use of a capsulotomy technique that relies on discission rather than pulverization of the membrane and avoids the thicker portions of the membrane when possible.\r"

Seventeen patients had meningitis, 12 had meningococcemia, 13 had unsuspected or \"occult\" bacteremia, and five had other diagnoses. \"Occult\" bacteremia was diagnosed initially in four patients, but subsequently meningitis was diagnosed. All 13 patients with 500 or more organisms per milliliter had meningitis or meningococcemia in contrast to 12 (55%) of 22 patients with less than 500 organisms per milliliter (P less than or equal to .0035). Only 18 (42%) of these patients bacteremic with N meningitidis presented with petechiae or purpura. All 13 children with occult bacteremia were sent home after blood cultures were obtained; six of the 13 received a regimen of oral amoxicillin for otitis media. At reexamination (interval 16 to 119 hours) four had meningitis, seven were clinically improved (afebrile, negative blood culture, without invasive disease), and two were still mildly febrile with negative blood culture. Three of these bacteremic children experienced spontaneous clinical and bacteriologic resolution without antibiotic treatment. This has not been previously reported.\r"

Beta-adrenergic aerosols are the first line of defense; these are followed, when necessary, by either timed-release theophylline or oral beta-adrenergics. Often, a combination of these drugs must be used to achieve effective relief of symptoms. Once-daily theophylline preparations can be extremely effective in patients who need regular medication and in whom gastrointestinal upset or compliance is a problem. In patients who have frequent setbacks, occasional courses of tapered doses of steroid are necessary. When oral steroids are necessary regularly, the physician should consider using an aerosol corticosteroid, cromolyn sodium, or both. These drugs can be used daily with relative safety. However, only a small amount (ie, no more than 12%) of an inhaled medication reaches the lungs. In selected patients, regular doses of cromolyn sodium are used for prophylaxis and may preclude the need for theophylline or oral beta-adrenergics, which can have deleterious effects in adults and children. Cromolyn sodium is most effective if used before exercise or exposure to animals. Research is continuing on more effective and longer-acting beta-adrenergic aerosols and oral preparations.\r"

Using a highly specific antibody against phosphotyrosine, we have isolated the tyrosine-phosphorylated p210BCR-ABL and several other proteins containing phosphotyrosine from a variety of CML cell lines. p210BCR-ABL isolated by the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody possessed protein-tyrosine kinase activity in vitro comparable to that of the p210BCR-ABL isolated by antibody to a specific peptide sequence in the ABL protein-tyrosine kinase. Other prominent proteins containing phosphorylated tyrosine residues were observed at 185, 150, 120, 105, 63, 56, 36, and 32 kDa, and less prominent proteins were observed at 195, 155, 94, 53, 40, and less than 29 kDa. Staphylococcal V8 peptide mapping indicated that proteins of similar molecular weights were highly homologous to each other across cell lines, despite the diverse hematopoietic lineages of these cells and the genetic heterogeneity of the patients from whom the CML cell lines were derived. Phosphopeptide mapping also revealed that these proteins were distinct from each other as well as from p210BCR-ABL. Because virtually identical phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were found in peripheral blood leukocytes taken directly from CML patients, these proteins are not an artifact of long-term tissue culture but appear to be an integral part of the CML phenotype.\r"

Both the viral and cellular src proteins produced in yeast cells were myristoylated at their amino termini, as is the case for src proteins expressed in chicken embryo fibroblasts. The viral src protein produced in yeast autophosphorylated at tyrosine-416 in vivo and had approximately the same level of in vitro kinase activity as p60v-src expressed in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells. Unlike p60c-src expressed in chicken cells, which is phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo almost exclusively at tyrosine-527, p60c-src expressed in yeast was phosphorylated 2.5-3 times more at tyrosine-416 than at tyrosine-527. The specific activity of the p60c-src produced in yeast was 2.5-5.0 times higher than that of p60c-src overexpressed from a retroviral vector in chicken cells, implicating the altered state of in vivo phosphorylation in modulation of the in vitro kinase activity. The expression of p60v-src substantially slowed down the growth of the yeast cells, suggesting that phosphorylation of yeast proteins essential for cell growth may have interfered with their proper functioning.\r"

  ".W": "In embryos of Drosophila melanogaster the development of a pluripotent cell in the neurogenic ectoderm as a member of either a neural or an epidermal lineage depends on its interactions with neighboring cells. Certain genes, designated neurogenic, participate in this process in that there is a deficiency of epidermal histotypes in mutant embryos lacking neurogenic gene functions. To test the cell autonomy of expression of the neurogenic phenotype, individual cells were transplanted from the neurogenic ectoderm of mutant donor embryos into wild-type host embryos. Cells transplanted from donors homozygous for any of several mutant alleles of the neurogenic genes amx, N, bib, mam, neu, and Dl were found to give rise to clones exhibiting a distribution of neural and epidermal histotypes similar to that of the wild type. By contrast, cells transplanted from donors homozygous for loss of the neurogenic E(spl) gene gave rise exclusively to clones of neural histotypes. Thus, only the expression of E(spl) is autonomous, with that of all of the other tested neurogenic genes being nonautonomous. These results are consistent with the inference that the nonautonomous genes provide a source and the autonomous gene provides a receptor of a hypothetical intercellular regulatory signal that is necessary for cell commitment to an epidermal rather than neural fate.\r"

Intact molecules of mAb 1604, as well as its Fab fragments, inhibited developmental aggregation, autolysis, fruiting body formation, and sporulation. The addition of relatively small amounts of antibody every 4 hr was much more effective than a single large dose given at the onset of development. The inhibitory action of mAb 1604 on development was reversible after prolonged incubation of the antibody with cells; this was probably due to proteolytic degradation of the antibody. The effect of mAb 1604 on submerged bacterial development was neutralized by affinity-purified 1604 cell surface antigen. Another antibody, mAb 2788, directed against an M. xanthus cell surface antigen, did not block development. These data suggest that 1604 cell surface antigens is involved in contact-mediated cell interactions in M. xanthus.\r"

Terminators placed between the promoters and galK restrict transcription and expression of galK on these plasmids. However, when lambda N protein is provided, and if a functional N interaction site, nutR, is intact, transcription antitermination occurs and galK expression increases. Deletions into the nutR region affect the ability to antiterminate. From the results obtained we conclude that: boxA, a site believed to bind host factors (Nus), is not required for transcription antitermination in this system; the host NusA function is required even in the absence of boxA; nutR is required for N antitermination; translation across the nutR sequence prevents N-dependent antitermination.\r"

A fragment carrying the promoter of this operon (gnt promoter) and the first gene (gntR) was subcloned into a promoter probe vector (pPL603B). Repression of the expression of cat-86 gene, encoded in the vector portion of a constructed plasmid (pgnt21), that is under the control of the gnt promoter was removed by gluconate. The results of deletion analysis and of insertional inactivation of the gntR gene cloned in pgnt21 suggested that the product of the gntR gene, actually synthesized as a 29-kDa protein in vivo, is involved in repression of the gnt promoter. A 4-base-pair insertional mutation within the gntR gene constructed in vitro was introduced into the B. subtilis chromosomal gnt operon by use of linkage of the 4 base pairs to gntK10 in transformation. The introduced mutation gntR1 caused the constitutive expression of the gluconate kinase and gluconate permease genes. S1 nuclease analysis indicated that the mRNA of this operon is synthesized in the gntR1 strain and amounts of mRNA are not changed very much by gluconate, which acts as an inducer in the wild-type gene. These results strongly indicate that the gntR gene codes for a transcriptional negative regulator for the gnt operon.\r"

  ".W": "We present data that demonstrate that three MR elements isolated from wild populations of Drosophila melanogaster on two continents can cause large deletions of the X chromosome in males. The deleted chromosomes, termed mini-X chromosomes, are induced at a frequency of approximately 1:4000 in chromosomes that are initially free of P elements. In situ hybridizations using a cloned P sequence as a probe fail to reveal any sequences homologous to the nomadic P family at the deletion breakpoints. Genetic analysis of 12 such mini-X chromosomes also reveals that there are no \"hotspots\" of chromosome breakage and that there must have been a minimum of three distinct distal breakpoints and five different proximal breakpoints in the formation of these deleted chromosomes. In fact all 12 proximal and 12 distal breakpoints may well be unique. Our data show that MR elements generate essentially random breaks along the X chromosome. We emphasize that we find no involvement of P sequences in the chromosome breakage process, consonant with the notion that MR elements exert their influence on processes involved in mitotic crossing-over.\r"

  ".W": "Human leukemic T cells carrying a t(10;14)(q24;q11) chromosome translocation were fused with mouse leukemic T cells, and the hybrids were examined for genetic markers of human chromosomes 10 and 14. Hybrids containing the human 10q+ chromosome had the human genes for terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase that has been mapped at 10q23-q25 and for C alpha [the constant region of TCRA (the alpha-chain locus of the T-cell antigen receptor gene)], but not for V alpha (the variable region of TCRA). Hybrids containing the human 14q- chromosome retained the V alpha genes. Thus the 14q11 breakpoint in the t(10;14) chromosome translocation directly involves TCRA, splitting the locus in a region between the V alpha and the C alpha genes. These results suggest that the translocation of the C alpha locus to a putative cellular protooncogene located proximal to the breakpoint at 10q24, for which we propose the name TCL3, results in its deregulation, leading to T-cell leukemia. Since hybrids with the 10q+ chromosome also retained the human terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase gene, it is further concluded that the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase locus is proximal to the TCL3 gene, at band 10q23-q24.\r"

  ".U": "87260845\r", 
  ".W": "To examine the distribution of rearrangements of the gamma- and beta-chain T-cell receptor (TCR) genes in T- and non-T acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs), and potentially to determine which genes rearrange first in ontogeny, we analyzed high molecular weight DNA from 102 patients with acute leukemia. Rearranged gamma- and beta-chain genes were found in all T-cell ALLs (22/22) examined. Overall, 27% (18/66) of B-lineage ALLs had beta-chain gene rearrangements, and 41% (24/58) had gamma-chain gene rearrangements, but the distribution of rearranged genes varied according to the stage of B-cell differentiation. The gamma-chain genes were rearranged in 11% (1/9) of the B-lineage patients negative for the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (cALLA) and 50% (23/46) of cALLA+ ALL patients, while the beta-chain genes were not rearranged in any of the 7 cALLA- ALL patients examined but were rearranged in 32% (18/56) of the cALLA+ patients. Neither TCR gene was found to be rearranged in acute nonlymphoid leukemia patients (0/12) or in patients with B-cell (surface immunoglobulin-positive) leukemia (0/3). Of the 44 cALLA+ patients in which a direct comparison of gamma- and beta-chain gene rearrangements could be made, 34% had both genes rearranged, 16% had only gamma-chain gene rearrangements, and the remaining 50% had both genes in the germ-line configuration. beta-Chain rearrangements have not been found in the absence of gamma-chain rearrangements, thus supporting a proposed hierarchy of TCR gene rearrangements. A provocative finding was that only a small percentage (11%) of the patients with cALLA- B precursor cell ALLs had rearranged TCR genes, while 50% of the cALLA+ leukemia patients had at least gamma-chain rearrangement, raising a question as to whether indeed cALLA- cells are precursors to cALLA+ cells. Interestingly, 18% (2/11) of the cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (cIg)-positive cALLA+ (pre-B) ALLs involved TCR gene rearrangements, compared to 60% (21/35) of the cIg-negative cases, suggesting the possibility that the majority of functional B cells are derived from the cALLA+ pool that contains immunoglobulin but not TCR gene rearrangements.\r"

  ".U": "87260851\r", 
  ".W": "An ideal treatment for autoimmune diseases would be a nontoxic means of specifically neutralizing the autoreactive lymphocytes responsible for the disease. This goal has been realized in experimental autoimmunity models by immunizing rats or mice against their own autoimmune cells such that the animals generate an immune response specifically repressive to the disease-producing lymphocytes. This maneuver, termed lymphocyte vaccination, was demonstrated to be effective using some, but not all, autoimmune helper T-lymphocyte lines. We now report that T lymphocytes, otherwise incapable of triggering an immune response, can be transformed into effective immunogens by treating the cells in vitro with hydrostatic pressure. Clone A2b, as effector clone that recognized cartilage proteoglycan and caused adjuvant arthritis in Lewis rats, is such a cell. Untreated A2b could not trigger an immune response, but inoculating rats with pressure-treated A2b induced early remission of established adjuvant arthritis as well as resistance to subsequent disease. Specific resistance to arthritis was associated with anti-idiotypic T-cell reactivity to clone A2b and could be transferred from vaccinated rats to naive recipients using donor lymphoid cells. Aggregation of T-lymphocyte membrane components appeared to be important for an immune response because the effects of hydrostatic pressure could be reproduced by treatment of A2b with chemical cross-linkers or with agents disrupting the cytoskeleton. Populations of lymph node cells from antigen-primed rats, when treated with hydrostatic pressure, could also induce suppression of disease. Thus, effective vaccines can be developed without having to isolate the autoimmune T lymphocytes as lines or clones. These results demonstrate that effector T lymphocytes suitably treated may serve as agents for specifically controlling the immune system.\r"

Previous studies have demonstrated that cell lines derived from freshly explanted Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells (DEC) have abundant mRNA for rearranged T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma-chain genes. Analysis of Thy-1+ DEC in situ, freshly isolated cell suspensions of Thy-1+ DEC, and long-term Thy-1+ DEC lines demonstrated that 100% of the Thy-1+ DEC reacted with a monoclonal antibody to the epsilon chain of the murine T3 complex and that 40-60% of resident Thy-1+ DEC were also reactive with an antiserum to the TCR gamma chain. Two Thy-1+ DEC lines expressed a disulfide-linked 70-kDa molecule that could be precipitated with an anti-gamma-chain antiserum and could be coprecipitated with an antiserum to the T3 delta chain; the molecule appeared as a single 34-kDa band under reducing conditions. The phenotype of Thy-1+ DEC (T3+, L3T4-, Lyt-2-, TCR gamma chain+) thus resembles that of the recently described subpopulation of murine and human lymphocytes that have been identified in the thymus, peripheral blood, and fetal blood.\r"

  ".W": "The lymphocyte differentiation antigen CD4 serves as a receptor for human retroviruses associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) through its interaction with the major envelope virion glycoprotein, gp120, which is also expressed on the surface of infected cells. In these experiments, purified gp120 was shown to bind to normal human T-lymphocyte populations. The gp120-CD4 complex served as a target antigen for antibody-dependent complement-mediated cytolysis by a goat serum raised against native gp120. However, patient sera that bound to gp120-adsorbed cells failed to direct their destruction in the presence of complement. In contrast, these sera were potent mediators of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. These studies demonstrate that gp120 situated on the cell surface can serve as an effective target for immune destruction by patient antibodies and effector lymphocytes. The possible contribution of this type of immunity to control of disease progression, on the one hand, and to lymphocyte destruction and immunopathology observed in AIDS, on the other, is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the activity of mouse B-cell stimulatory factor 1 (interleukin 4, IL-4) on resting splenic B cells and on a B-cell hybridoma. Purified T-cell-derived as well as recombinant IL-4 was shown to increase the expression of the low-affinity Fc receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon R) on a majority of B lymphocytes in a 24-hr culture period. Levels of Fc epsilon R expression increased 2- to 3-fold on splenic B cells and up to 6-fold on a B-cell hybridoma. The effect was inhibited by an anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody and by mouse gamma-interferon. Other recombinant lymphokines exhibited no effect on either Fc epsilon R expression or the induction by IL-4. The presence of IgE during the stimulation with IL-4 resulted in an additional increase in Fc epsilon R expression. These data and results showing that IgE prevents Fc epsilon R turnover while IL-4 increases the rate of Fc epsilon R synthesis suggest that the mechanisms by which IgE and IL-4 increase Fc epsilon R expression are likely to be different. The starting population of splenic B cells expressed low levels of Fc epsilon R and was relatively uniform in size (small). After greater than 48 hr of culture with IL-4, viable B cells had not undergone DNA synthesis and consisted mainly of larger highly Fc epsilon R-positive cells (23%) and medium-sized Fc epsilon R-positive cells (60%). A possible role for Fc epsilon R in certain B-cell maturation pathways is discussed.\r"

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes may be generated from resting lymphocytes by incubation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells for 3 days with the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody OKT3. Cytotoxicity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells can also be induced by adding an anti-target-OKT3 antibody conjugate and 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum to the culture medium. Conjugate activation of T cells was almost completely blocked, however, when 20% (vol/vol) human serum was added to the medium. Conjugate-mediated peripheral blood mononuclear cells activation was restored to some extent by the addition of melanoma target cells to the culture and was markedly enhanced by a second conjugate containing anti-target cell and anti-CD28 antibody. Monoclonal antibody 9.3 (anti-CD28) provides a progression signal in T-lymphocyte activation when used in combination with anti-CD3. Thus, presentation by the tumor target cells of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 to resting human lymphocytes causes T-cell activation, which is independent of monocytes, proceeds in the presence of human serum, and results in tumor cell killing.\r"

The amount of immunoreactive inhibin detected in the spent media of these cells is in proportion to the density of cells plated and the concentration of exogenously added follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In the presence of the estrogen precursor androstenedione (10(-7) M), FSH, but not luteinizing hormone, produced a dose-dependent increase in inhibin during 2-day culture of granulosa cells. In the absence of the estrogen precursor, similar but somewhat diminished inhibin production in responding to FSH was observed. Exogenously added estrogen potentiated the FSH-mediated release of inhibin in the absence of androstenedione. Neither androstenedione nor estradiol added to the cultured Sertoli cells had effect on inhibin production. A preparation of pure inhibin isolated on the basis of an in vitro bioassay and characterized chemically specifically suppressed serum FSH but not luteinizing hormone, when it was injected (24 micrograms per injection, two injections) into acutely ovariectomized rats. Thus, inhibin secreted by the granulosa and Sertoli cells specifically suppresses the secretion of pituitary FSH, and in turn FSH is primarily responsible for the inhibin production in these gonadal cells, as in a classical negative-feedback relationship.\r"

The causative agent of this disease, Legionella pneumophila, is a Gram-negative bacterium that is present in a variety of aquatic environments. L. pneumophila is a facultative intracellular parasite; it grows within human phagocytic cells and eventually causes their destruction. In contrast to many other intracellular parasites, L. pneumophila is a Gram-negative bacterium that can be grown in standard microbiological culture medium. To determine the factors that enable this organism to enter, survive, and multiply within human mononuclear phagocytes, we chose bacteriophage Mu, a powerful genetic tool that transposes within the host cell genome, to generate insertion mutations and gene fusions in the Legionella genome. Certain derivatives of Mu are able to generate fusions between target genes and the lac operon from Escherichia coli. We have determined that although Mu is unable to attach to L. pneumophila or complete its life cycle within Legionella, it does transpose within the Legionella genome. Transposition was detected with a mini-Mu phage that carries the lac operon of E. coli.\r"

In contrast, the DR7 beta sequence was as unrelated to DR4 beta sequence as it was to other DR beta-related genes, except at the 3'-untranslated region. These results suggest that the DR7 and DR4 haplotypes may have been derived relatively recently from a common ancestral haplotype and that the DR4 and DR7 beta-chain genes have undergone more rapid diversification in their beta 1 domains, most probably as a result of natural selection, than have the DRw53 beta-chain genes. Short tracts of sequence within the DR7 and DRw53 beta 1 domains were shared with other DR beta sequences, indicating that exchanges of genetic information between beta 1 domains of DR beta-related genes have played a part in their evolution. Serological analysis of mouse L-cell transfectants expressing surface HLA-DR7 molecules, confirmed by antibody binding and allelic sequence comparisons, identified amino acid residues that may be critical to the binding of a monomorphic DR- and DP-specific monoclonal antibody.\r"

The rate for the reversion of a termination codon in the second exon is even less than that for the small deletions and is 1000 times lower than the reversion rate that had been determined for the variable-region gene segment. Therefore, the variable-region gene segment is likely to be the preferred target for hypermutation.\r"

Several specific protein-binding activities were found using a 45-base-pair (bp) HinfI/Sau96I (-142 to -98 bp) and a 38-bp Sau96I/Sau96I (-97 to -60 bp) fragment, which include conserved sequence X (-113 to -100 bp) and conserved sequence Y (-80 to -71 bp), respectively.

The factor binding site in the W sequence is also found to be conserved among beta-chain genes and is suggested to be a gamma-interferon control region.\r"

  ".W": "We describe an immunoglobulin gene recombination indicator in which a specific rearrangement via deletion results in the acquisition of a dominant phenotype. The indicator consists of the Escherichia coli xanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (gpt) gene, whose translation is prevented by the presence of an upstream initiation codon out of frame with respect to the gpt coding sequence. Flanking this barrier initiation codon are the heptamer-spacer-nonamer recognition sequences from a kappa chain variable region (V kappa) and from a kappa chain joining region (J kappa). A proper V-J joint results in the deletion of the translational barrier and allows expression of the selectable marker. When tested by transfection into fibroblasts, no rearrangements were detected and the presence of the barrier initiation codon was sufficient to completely abolish gpt expression in these cells. Similarly, no rearrangements were detected after transfer of the test gene into myeloma cells. However, when the construct was introduced into the pre-B-cell line 38B9, greater than 80% of the transfected cells showed evidence of a specific rearrangement. These rearrangements were associated with the translation of gpt, although no selection for its expression was needed. DNA sequence analysis of six different V-J joints revealed that the rearrangement proceeded with a high degree of accuracy. These results indicate that only very minimal DNA sequences (21 base pairs 5' of the V heptamer and 4 base pairs 3' of its nonamer; less than 45 base pairs 5' of the J nonamer and 3' of its heptamer) are required for efficient rearrangement and provide formal proof that kappa gene segments can rearrange by a deletional mechanism.\r"

Protoplasts were produced by treatment with lysozyme following growth in glycine, and a medium was defined on which a significant fraction of the osmotically sensitive cells were regenerated. Transfections were carried out with DNA from corynephage 782, a member of the beta family of converting phages, and transformations were performed with DNA of plasmid pNG2, a 9500-kDa plasmid that was isolated from an erythromycin-resistant strain of C. diphtheriae and carries the resistance gene. Strains of Corynebacterium glutamicum and Escherichia coli were also successfully transformed with pNG2 DNA. Transfection frequencies were in the range of 3-8 X 10(3) plaque-forming units/micrograms of phage DNA, and transformation frequencies were in the range of 0.2-150 colony-forming units/micrograms of plasmid DNA. Plasmid pNG2 replicated and was stably maintained in all transformants both in the presence or absence of erythromycin. Thus, it displayed the ability to replicate in strains of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria without the intervention of genetic engineering. pNG2 DNA isolated from any of the transformed strains was able to transform all parental strains. The host range of pNG2 suggests its possible utility in or as a shuttle vector for the study and manipulation of genes from corynebacterial strains of animal origin.\r"

Using selective hybridization of synthetic oligonucleotides to transformant DNA, we have determined that a single G X C to A X T base transition in either the first or second position of the 12th codon is associated with activation of the gene. Such mutations would lead to amino acid substitutions of aspartate or serine for glycine in the mutant proteins. To confirm these findings, we applied a technique for direct sequence analysis of a 90-base-pair region of the rat c-Ki-ras gene produced by primer-directed enzymatic amplification. Findings produced by this approach, which provides a convenient method to characterize mutations in multiple alleles without the necessity to clone individual genes, confirmed the presence and identity of the 12th codon mutations in the activated oncogene, as initially determined by the oligonucleotide hybridization technique.\r"

Analysis of surface characteristics, growth requirements, and kinetics suggested that these cells represent early stages of the B-cell differentiation pathway. Here we describe a modification of the assay, which allowed us to determine the differentiative potential of these clonable pre-B cells. Using a nitrocellulose protein-transfer technique, we studied immunoglobulin light chain expression in colonies derived from fetal mouse liver B-cell precursors; in particular, we explored whether the B-cell precursors are already committed to the expression of a particular light chain gene at the initiation of culture. Our results show that fetal liver-derived B-cell progenitors generate colonies in vitro that secrete kappa and lambda light chains at a ratio similar to that found in colonies derived from adult splenic B cells. Further, we document the existence of colonies that are derived from single cells and that simultaneously secrete both types of light chains. This indicates that the progenitors of (kappa + lambda)-producing colonies are light chain-uncommitted at the initiation of culture. These cells are able to rearrange their light chain genes in vitro and differentiate along the B-cell pathway to form colonies secreting both kappa and lambda chains.\r"

  ".U": "87260921\r", 
  ".W": "Fifty-five ovarian cancer patients receiving platinum drug-based chemotherapy have been studied prospectively to determine the extent of formation of the bidentate intrastrand adducts of diammineplatinum covalently attached to the N7 positions of adenosine and/or guanosine in leukocyte DNA. Data for clinical response, obtained from medical records, were then correlated with the adduct values. Patients were treated with platinum-based single-agent or combination chemotherapy containing cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) or diamminecyclobutane-dicarboxylatoplatinum on approved experimental protocols. Adduct measurements were performed by ELISA, and disease response to therapy was assessed by standard oncologic criteria. This study comprises a total of 101 blood samples obtained after intravenous cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) or diamminecyclobutane-dicarboxylatoplatinum infusion from 55 individuals, and in each case the highest (or \"peak\") adduct level for each patient was chosen for statistical analysis. Values for median adduct levels in patients grouped by complete response, partial response, and no response were 212, 193, and 62 amol of adduct per microgram of DNA, respectively. Analysis of these data by Jonckheere's test (an extension of the Mann-Whitney test) shows that higher levels of adduct formation correlates with disease response with a two-sided P value of 0.030. Of eight patients on single-agent therapy whose buffy-coat samples did not have measurable adduct levels, none responded to therapy. Analysis of these data using the exact test for trend shows that the formation of adduct at a level of 160 amol/micrograms of DNA or greater correlates with disease response with a two-sided P value of 0.032. Thus in ovarian cancer patients, the formation of the intrastrand diammineplatinum adducts in leukocyte DNA is associated with favorable disease response to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) or diamminecyclobutane-dicarboxylatoplatinum chemotherapy.\r"

A single band (approximately equal to 1.2 kilobases) was detected in poly(A)+ RNA isolated from human organs. This RNA hybridized specifically to human IFN-alpha 1 DNA and comigrated with mature IFN-alpha mRNA from virus-induced human peripheral blood leukocytes. No IFN-beta RNA transcripts were detected in any of the tissues tested. IFN-gamma mRNA was detected in only one sample of normal human spleen, which also contained an unusually high level of IFN-alpha mRNA. The use of a modified S1 mapping technique revealed the presence of IFN-alpha 1 and -alpha 2 transcripts only. No IFN-alpha 4, -alpha 5, -alpha 6, -alpha 7, -alpha 8, or -alpha 14 transcripts were detected in the same sample. The detection, in all the samples tested, of a characteristic pattern of expression of IFN genes, different from that obtained following induction, together with the low number of transcripts present (less than or equal to 0.03 copy per cell) suggest that specific IFN genes are transcribed constitutively in vivo.\r"

The mer DNA sequence includes seven open reading frames, two of which have been identified by homology with the merA (mercuric reductase) and merB (organomercurial lyase) genes from the mercurial-resistance determinants of Gram-negative bacteria. Whereas 40% of the amino acid residues overall were identical between the pI258 merA polypeptide product and mercuric reductases from Gram-negative bacteria, the percentage identity in the active-site positions and those thought to be involved in NADPH and FAD contacts was above 90%. The 216 amino acid organomercurial lyase sequence was 39% identical with that from a Serratia plasmid, with higher conservation in the middle of the sequences and lower homologies at the amino and carboxyl termini. The remaining five open reading frames in the pI258 mer sequence have no significant homologies with the genes from previously sequenced Gram-negative mer operons.\r"

Kahn and Gilman [Kahn, R. A. & Gilman, A. G. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7906-7911] identified another guanyl nucleotide-binding protein termed ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) that stimulated this reaction. It was proposed that the toxin substrate is an ARF-Gs alpha complex and that ARF may have a physiological role in regulation of Gs alpha activity. We have found that purified ARF from bovine brain enhances not only the ADP-ribosylation of Gs alpha but also Gs alpha-independent choleragen-catalyzed reactions. These are (i) ADP-ribosylation of agmatine, a low molecular weight guanidino compound; (ii) ADP-ribosylation of several proteins unrelated to Gs alpha; and (iii) auto-ADP-ribosylation of the toxin A1 peptide. These reactions, as well as the ADP-ribosylation of ARF itself, were stimulated by GTP or stable GTP analogues such as guanyl-5'-yl imido-beta gamma-diphosphate and guanosine 5'-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate; GDP and guanosine 5'-O-[beta-thio]diphosphate were inactive. These observations are consistent with the conclusion that ARF interacts directly with the A subunit of choleragen in a GTP-dependent fashion thereby enhancing catalytic activity manifest as transfer of ADP-ribose to Gs alpha and other proteins, to the toxin A1 peptide, or to agmatine. It is tempting to speculate that ARF may be involved in regulating one or another of the ADP-ribosyltransferases found in animal cells.\r"

Primary and secondary L-cell transfectants expressing CEA were selected with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). These transfectants, including some clones that were selected for high-level CEA expression by multiple rounds of FACS sorting, express a surface protein of 150 kDa that reacts with all anti-CEA antibodies tested. In parallel, a cDNA library of LoVo poly(A)+ RNA was constructed in lambda gt11 and fusion proteins were screened with polyclonal antisera against CEA. One positive clone, lambda cLV7, was identified that hybridized specifically to transfectant DNA. The nucleic acid sequence of the cDNA insert (cLV7) contained two regions of extensive internal homology, with greater than 70% identity at the amino acid level. cLV7 hybridized to three mRNA species of LoVo cells and to a predominant mRNA of the CEA-expressing transfectants. Hybridization of cLV7 to restriction endonuclease-digested genomic DNA of colon carcinoma cells, normal human cells, and human-mouse somatic cell hybrids revealed the presence of multiple hybridizing bands, one of which was present in transfectant cells.

DNA probes for three distinct isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit mapped to three different mouse chromosomes: the alpha 1 gene (Atpa-1) cosegregated with the Egf gene on chromosome 3; alpha 2 (Atpa-2) with the cytochrome P-450PB gene family/coumarin hydroxylase locus on chromosome 7; alpha 3 (Atpa-3) with the alpha-spectrin gene on chromosome 1. The Na,K-ATPase beta-subunit gene (Atpb) mapped to the same region of chromosome 1, but it was not tightly linked to the Atpa-3 gene. These results indicate that three isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit are encoded by three distinct genes.

  ".W": "Cotransfection of cDNA encoding the trans-activator gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus, type I (HTLV-I) (tat-I), which acts in trans to augment viral gene expression, has revealed strong regulatory effects of this viral protein on the inducible cellular promoters governing human interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-2 receptor (Tac) gene expression. The tat-I protein stimulates a 3- to 6-fold increase in IL-2 receptor (Tac) promoter activity in transfected Jurkat T cells, but not in the natural killer-like YT cell line, as measured by changes in the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT; EC 2.3.1.28) reporter gene linked to this promoter. In contrast, tat-I alone has little or no effect on IL-2 promoter activity in Jurkat T cells but markedly synergizes with other mitogenic stimuli (phytohemagglutinin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or the OKT3 monoclonal antibody), which alone are ineffective. The tat-I protein also partially circumvents the pronounced inhibitory effects of cyclosporin A on the IL-2 promoter. Other cellular and viral promoters are unaffected by the tat-I gene product, either alone or in combination with other mitogens. The specific effects of the tat-I gene product on the IL-2 and IL-2 receptor (Tac) promoters suggest the possibility of an autocrine or paracrine mechanism of T-cell growth as an early event in HTLV-I-mediated leukemogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "87260992\r", 
  ".W": "There are at least two interleukin 2 (IL-2) binding peptides: one is the Mr 55,000 peptide (p55) reactive with the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody, and the other is a Mr 75,000 non-Tac IL-2 binding peptide (p75). Independently existing Tac or p75 peptides represent low-affinity IL-2 receptors, whereas high-affinity IL-2 receptors are expressed when both peptides are present and associated in a receptor complex. It has long been known that normal large granular lymphocytes (LGL) or leukemic cells from the patients with abnormal expansions of LGL can be activated by IL-2 not only to more-potent natural killer cells but also to effectors of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity, although they do not express the Tac peptide. In the present study, using cross-linking methodology, we found that normal LGL and leukemic LGL from all individuals tested expressed the p75 IL-2 binding peptide but did not express the Tac peptide. These LGL leukemia cells made proliferative responses to IL-2 but required a much higher concentration than that required for the proliferation of normal phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T lymphoblasts that express high-affinity receptors. Furthermore, the addition of IL-2 to Tac-negative LGL leukemic cells augmented transcription of the Tac gene and induced the Tac peptide. Neither the IL-2-induced proliferation nor the up-regulation of Tac gene expression was inhibited by the addition of anti-Tac. These results strongly suggest that the p75 peptide is responsible for IL-2-induced activation of LGL and that the p75 peptide alone can mediate an IL-2 signal. Thus, the p75 peptide may play an important role in the IL-2-mediated immune response not only by participating with the Tac peptide in the formation of the high-affinity receptor complex on T cells but also by contributing to the initial triggering of LGL activation so that these cells become efficient natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer cells.\r"

This paper examines the requirements for receptor expression. Normal murine splenocyte populations were enriched for B cells and cultured at relatively low density. IL-2 receptor expression was studied by measuring the binding of the anti-IL-2 receptor monoclonal antibody PC61. Lymphoblasts arising through stimulation by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide failed to express IL-2 receptors. B cells cultured with conditioned medium from concanavalin A-stimulated EL4 thymoma cells, with or without LPS, displayed IL-2 receptors. This bioactivity of EL4 conditioned medium could not be replaced by any concentration of B-cell-stimulatory factor 1 (IL-4), IL-1, IL-2, or IL-3 tested. However, the recently cloned lymphokine T-cell-replacing factor (IL-5) was a potent inducer of IL-2 receptor expression, as was the probably identical material known as eosinophil differentiation factor. The receptors so induced appeared to be functional, as receptor-expressing (but not control) lymphoblasts, responded to IL-2 by proliferation, indicative of high-affinity-receptor expression.\r"

In the present study, we have examined the molecular events that accompany the induction of this unresponsive state. T cells stimulated in this manner failed to produce IL-2, but interleukin 3, interferon-gamma, and IL-2 receptors were partially induced and T-cell receptor beta mRNA was fully induced. Although T-cell unresponsiveness correlated with an IL-2 production defect, addition of IL-2 during the induction phase failed to prevent development of the unresponsive state. The critical biochemical event appeared to be an increase in intracellular calcium. Removal of calcium from the medium prevented induction of the unresponsive state, whereas addition of the calcium ionophore ionomycin induced unresponsiveness as well as all of the related partial activation events. Thus, an increase in intracellular calcium under nonmitogenic conditions appears to initiate an alternative activation program that prevents the T cell from producing IL-2 in response to subsequent normal activation signals. The significance of this in vitro model for tolerance induction in vivo is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "A molecular genetic approach employing polymorphic DNA markers has been used to investigate the role of chromosomal aberrations in meningioma, one of the most common tumors of the human nervous system. Comparison of the alleles detected by DNA markers in tumor DNA versus DNA from normal tissue revealed chromosomal alterations present in primary surgical specimens. In agreement with cytogenetic studies of cultured meningiomas, the most frequent alteration detected was loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 22. Forty of 51 patients were constitutionally heterozygous for at least one chromosome 22 DNA marker. Seventeen of the 40 constitutionally heterozygotic patients (43%) displayed hemizygosity for the corresponding marker in their meningioma tumor tissues. Loss of heterozygosity was also detected at a significantly lower frequency for markers on several other autosomes. In view of the striking association between acoustic neuroma and meningioma in bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis and the discovery that acoustic neuromas display specific loss of genes on chromosome 22, we propose that a common mechanism involving chromosome 22 is operative in the development of both tumor types. Fine-structure mapping to reveal partial deletions in meningiomas may provide the means to clone and characterize a gene (or genes) of importance for tumorigenesis in this and possibly other clinically associated tumors of the human nervous system.\r"

The exterior envelope glycoprotein of the retrovirus has been identified as gp120, and we demonstrate here that purified gp120 binds directly to cells expressing the CD4 (T4) surface antigen at a site spatially related to that recognized by the OKT4A monoclonal antibody. The gp120 was also able to temporarily interfere with viral infection and to block the process of multinucleated giant cell formation. However, if the carbohydrate chains were removed from gp120 by enzymatic treatment, CD4 binding and blockade of cell fusion was reduced by about a factor of 50. The significance of these results in relation to preventive and interventive approaches for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "87261001\r", 
  ".W": "Recently we demonstrated clinically significant levels of a previously unrecognized metabolite of the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (FUra) in bile of cancer patients. In the present study, reanalysis of bile from these patients demonstrated the presence of not one but two previously unrecognized metabolites. The major unrecognized metabolite was purified by reversed-phase HPLC, after which its molecular weight was determined by fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry to be 497. The similarity in HPLC retention times and molecular weights of this FUra derivative and the bile acids N-cholylglycine (Mr 465) and N-cholyltaurine (Mr 515), along with the structural similarity of the FUra catabolite 2-fluoro-beta-alanine and the amino acids glycine and taurine, led to the hypothesis that this metabolite could be a conjugate of 2-fluoro-beta-alanine and cholic acid. This hypothesis was tested and confirmed by hydrolyzing the purified metabolite by cholylglycine hydrolase after which: 2-fluoro-beta-alanine was demonstrated by using a sensitive HPLC technique capable of resolving all of the known putative FUra metabolites, and unconjugated cholic acid was identified by both GC and GC-MS. Additionally, chemically synthesized N-cholyl-2-fluoro-beta-alanine was shown to cochromatograph on HPLC and TLC with the purified biliary metabolite. In summary, this study demonstrates a unique, so far as we know, pathway of drug metabolism in man in which an amino acid drug metabolite is conjugated with cholic acid and eliminated into the bile. Furthermore, the finding that 2-fluoro-beta-alanine is conjugated to bile acids may provide some insight into the mechanism of cholestasis that is frequently observed after administration of fluoropyrimidine by hepatic arterial infusion.\r"

In each tissue, the appropriate selective agonist (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol for mu receptors in locus coeruleus or Tyr-D-Pen-Gly-Phe-D-Pen for delta receptors in submucous plexus) increased the conductance of an inwardly rectifying potassium conductance and strongly hyperpolarized the membrane. The properties of the potassium conductance affected by the two opioids could not be distinguished. Experiments with intracellular application of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate indicated that a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein was involved in the coupling between opioid receptor and potassium channel, but there was no evidence for activation of either cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C. It is noted that a number of vertebrate neurotransmitter receptors are coupled to potassium channels. The potassium conductance associated with these channels has properties similar to the conductance activated by mu and delta opioids; this family includes the following receptors: acetylcholine M2, norepinephrine alpha 2, dopamine D2, 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT1, adenosine A1, gamma-aminobutyric acid GABAB, and somatostatin. It is suggested that this conductance is a conserved neuronal effector coupled to one of the receptor types that mediates the effects of each of several major transmitters. The mu and delta opioid receptors appear to be unusual in that both utilize this same effector mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The quantitative relationship between receptor binding and hormone secretion at the single-cell level was investigated in the present study by combining a reverse hemolytic plaque assay for measurement of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion from individual pituitary cells with an autoradiographic assay of 125I-labeled gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist binding to the same cells. In the plaque assay, LH secretion induces complement-mediated lysis of the LH-antibody-coated erythrocytes around the gonadotropes, resulting in areas of lysis (plaques). LH release from individual gonadotropes was quantified by comparing radioimmunoassayable LH release to hemolytic area in similarly treated cohort groups of cells; plaque area was linearly related to the amount of LH secreted. Receptor autoradiography was performed using 125I-labeled GnRH-A (a superagonist analog of GnRH) both as the ligand and as the stimulant for LH release in the plaque assay; the developed silver grains appearing over cells in the center of plaques were measured microscopically. The grains appeared to represent specific and high-affinity receptors for GnRH because no pituitary cells other than gonadotropes bound the labeled ligand and grain development was progressively inhibited by coincubation with increasing doses of unlabeled GnRH-A. Despite high correlations between mean grain number and mean plaque area in dose-response curves, the correlation coefficients for these parameters were low (range 0.02-0.38) in the individual cells comprising these groups. We conclude that GnRH receptor number for any individual gonadotrope is a weak determinant of the amount of LH it can secrete; nevertheless, full occupancy of all its GnRH receptors is required for any gonadotrope to reach its full LH-secretory capacity. Apparently the levels of other factors comprising the steps along the secretory pathway determine the secretory capacity of an individual cell.\r"

Variability in TCR gamma polypeptide size and disulfide linkage is determined by the number of copies and the sequence of a repeated segment of the constant region. Thus C gamma 1 and C gamma 2 are used to generate structurally distinct, yet functional, T3-associated receptor complexes on peripheral blood lymphocytes.

The transition to seizure appears to be due to simultaneous increments in excitatory influences and decrements in inhibitory processes--both related to frequency-dependent neuronal events. A variety of specific hypotheses have been proposed to account for the increased excitability that occurs during epileptiform activity. Although each of the proposed mechanisms is likely to contribute significantly to the epileptic process, no single hypothesis provides an exclusive unifying framework within which all kinds of focal epilepsy can be understood. The spread of epileptic activity throughout the brain, the development of primary generalized epilepsy, the existence of \"gating\" mechanisms in specific anatomic locations, and the extrapolation of hypotheses derived from simple models of focal epilepsy to explain more complex forms of human epilepsy, all are not yet fully understood.\r"

This technique permitted the detection of cells carrying the t(14;18) hybrid DNA sequences at a dilution of 1:100,000. The remission marrow and blood samples of a patient with follicular lymphoma and the t(14;18) failed to show any abnormality by morphological examination and conventional Southern blot analysis. However, the t(14;18) hybrid DNA sequences were detected by the PCR technique. Thus, this technique is a highly sensitive tool to detect minimal residual cells carrying the t(14;18) and has the potential to identify a subpopulation of patients with subclinical disease.\r"

This effect was time- and dose-dependent and was abolished by prior treatment with the anticonvulsant drugs diazepam or pentobarbital. About 60 minutes after administration of Metrazole, c-fos messenger RNA reached a maximum and declined to basal levels after 180 minutes. A further decrease below that in normal brain was observed before a return to basal levels after 16 hours. While Metrazole still elicited seizures during this period, reinduction of c-fos was largely refractory. At 90 minutes, c-fos protein was observed in the nuclei of neurons in the dentate gyrus, and in the pyriform and cingulate cortices. Subsequently, c-fos protein appeared throughout the cortex, hippocampus, and limbic system. Thus, seizure activity results in increased c-fos gene expression in particular subsets of neurons.\r"

This treatment allowed the survival of islets of Langerhans transplanted across a major histocompatibility barrier without additional immunosuppression.

The role of its relative, the bcr/abl gene product, in the etiology of human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) remains speculative. To assess the transforming properties of the bcr/abl gene product, complementary DNA clones encoding the CML-specific P210 bcr/abl protein were expressed in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. In contrast to the v-abl oncogene product P160, the P210 bcr/abl gene product did not transform NIH/3T3 cells. Cell lines were isolated that expressed high levels of the P210 bcr/abl protein but were morphologically normal. During the course of these experiments, a transforming recombinant of bcr/abl was isolated which fuses gag determinants derived from helper virus to the NH2-terminus of the bcr/abl protein. This suggests that a property of viral gag sequences, probably myristylation-dependent membrane localization, must be provided to bcr/abl for it to transform fibroblasts.\r"

Determination of arterial blood gas and serum ketone levels, electrocardiograms, and chest x-ray films are done only when indicated, and not routinely. Few patients need to be treated in an intensive care unit, and most can be discharged in three days. This protocol has been safe and effective without mortality in 250 consecutive patients. By eliminating unnecessary laboratory tests, costs have been greatly reduced without deterioration in results.\r"

An albumin consisting of trimer and higher oligomer was more efficient than a preparation composed mainly of monomer and dimer. Modification of the hemagglutination-enhancing property of albumin was obtained by the addition of ligands (octanoate [caprylate] and Reactive Blue 2 [Cibacron Blue]). Irrespective of the polymer content, neither ligand alone had any effect on low-fatty-acid albumins. However, when mixtures of octanoate and Cibacron Blue were added to the same albumins, hemagglutination was initially increased, and then diminished with increasing concentrations of ligands. The enhancing property of high-fatty-acid, nonpolymerized albumin was markedly reduced by the addition of octanoate or Cibacron Blue. On the other hand, only Cibacron Blue could produce the same inhibitory effect on a polymerized albumin with high fatty acid content. The implication is that the total free fatty acids bound and polymer content are two independent variables that can affect the performance of an albumin as a hemagglutination enhancer.\r"

To provide a broad spectrum of experiences, the search included patients from a large number of institutions including Stanford University, Washington University (St. Louis), those participating in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, and a broad range of radiotherapy practices surveyed by the PCS (Patterns of Care Study). A total of 209 patients were identified. No selection criteria other than the aforementioned were applied. The patients were treated consecutively during the survey period. In sharp contradistinction to the reported results of the VA Uro-Oncology Group the analysis indicates a less than 10 per cent probability of progression within the first five years after completion of treatment. Nationwide, the outcome of radiotherapy-treated patients appears to be equivalent to the comparable surgically treated population.\r"

In the present study we have followed morbidity and mortality risk factors for five years in these males. Mortality was 40% in a hypertensive group and 16% in a normotensive group. In the normotensive group mortality was related to reinfarction. Furthermore, patients with a poor prognosis in the normotensive group had lower high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and lower apolipoprotein A-I concentration in plasma than patients with a good prognosis. Unexpectedly, in the hypertensive group death was related to a low (p less than 0.05) cortisol concentration in urine. It is concluded that a low HDL level may be a bad prognostic sign in males who have sustained an acute myocardial infarction and show no evidence of other risk factors, such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia or hypertension.\r"

Twenty-nine patients, 13 with AN, completed the study. Among neurographic variables, only sural nerve function tests correlated with autonomic functions. Patients with AN showed significantly lower mean sensory action potential amplitudes (SAPA) sural, indicating axonal losses, than patients without AN (3.58 +/- 0.79 microV v. 7.34 +/- 1.12 microV; p less than 0.01).

The importance of the condition, which is harmless, lies in the misinterpretation of values with subsequent erroneous treatment of thyrotoxicosis.

  ".W": "The utility of flecainide acetate was evaluated in 93 patients by means of electrophysiologic studies before and after intravenous flecainide administration to determine long-term efficacy. Twenty patients had a prior history of at least one cardiac arrest and 73 patients had sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). The mean radionuclear ejection fraction was 32 +/- 5%. Flecainide was evaluated in 93 patients, with 44 patients no longer having VT following flecainide (47% efficacy). Procainamide was evaluated in 69 patients; 24 patients had an adverse reaction to reaction to procainamide and 28 of the 69 patients were protected on procainamide (40% efficacy). The mean serum concentration of flecainide achieved in the protected group was 298 +/- 36 ng/ml and 4.3 micrograms/ml for procainamide. Both flecainide and procainamide significantly prolonged refractoriness, lengthened QRS duration, while only procainamide increased the QT interval. All 93 patients were discharged on antiarrhythmic therapy, 42 on flecainide, 27 on other antiarrhythmic therapy guided by electrophysiologic testing, and 24 on amiodarone (when all other agents failed). Six of the 42 patients on flecainide complained of adverse side effects, but none were severe enough to warrant stopping therapy. Of the 42 patients on flecainide, four (9%) died suddenly over 18 +/- 4 months. Twenty-seven patients were on other therapy; eight of these have died, three suddenly (11%), four with myocardial infarctions, and one due to congestive heart failure. Twenty-four patients started amiodarone; 11 have died, five (21%) suddenly, four of congestive heart failure, one of pulmonary fibrosis, and one with myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Three patients with drug-resistant atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia and two patients with reciprocating tachycardia associated with nodoventricular pathways received oral encainide after a control drug-free electrophysiologic study. In one patient with AV nodal reentry, encainide prolonged anterograde AV nodal conduction, produced complete ventriculoatrial (VA) block, and prevented tachycardia induction. Encainide had no effect on AV or VA conduction in the second patient with AV nodal reentry, and tachycardia with similar cycle length was still induced. The third patient was not studied while receiving encainide, but spontaneous AV nodal reentrant tachycardia occurring multiple times daily was abolished. In both patients with nodoventricular pathways, anterograde AV nodal and VA conduction were prolonged by encainide and tachycardia was no longer inducible. Two patients with AV nodal reentry were given long-term encainide therapy and have been free of recurrent arrhythmias for 16 and 30 months. One patient with a nodoventricular pathway has been without arrhythmia recurrence after 73 months of encainide therapy; the other patient required addition of propranolol to encainide because of recurrent tachycardia. We conclude that encainide can prolong anterograde AV nodal and VA conduction and prevent induced and spontaneous tachycardia in some patients with drug-resistant and highly symptomatic AV nodal or nodoventricular reentry.\r"

Twenty-nine patients were randomized to a tocainide (n = 15) or lidocaine (n = 14) group. Antiarrhythmic efficacy was defined as a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in single ventricular premature complex (VPC) frequency, greater than or equal to 90% reduction in paired VPC frequency, and total abolition of ventricular tachycardia. Efficacy was observed in 40% (6 of 15) of patients in the tocainide group and in 36% (5 of 14) patients in the lidocaine group. A 75% or greater reduction in total VPCs occurred in 40% (6 of 15) of patients in the tocainide group and in 57% (8 of 14) of patients in the lidocaine group. Greater than 90% suppression of paired VPCs occurred in 9 of 13 (69%) patients taking tocainide and in 6 of 11 (54%) patients taking lidocaine. Total abolition of ventricular tachycardia was documented in 5 of 11 (45%) patients given tocainide and in two of six (33%) patients given lidocaine. A total of 17 adverse reactions affecting 86% (12 of 14) of patients taking lidocaine and 11 adverse reactions affecting 53% (8 of 15) of patients taking tocainide occurred. Four patients in each treatment group suffered dose-limiting adverse effects. This study suggests that the efficacy and safety of intravenous tocainide are similar to that of intravenous lidocaine in patients with chronic ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Abrupt withdrawal of chronic nitroglycerin treatment may predispose the coronary circulation to spasm. To test this hypothesis directly, we developed a technique for performing selective coronary arteriography in the intact rabbit with images obtained by video-based methods or cineangiographic film. Experiments were then conducted in rabbits treated three times daily with topical nitroglycerin ointment for 6 weeks and in age- and sex-matched control animals. Forty hours after cessation of treatment, animals were anesthetized, and ECG and coronary vasoactive effects (determined by coronary arteriography) of ergonovine, 0.2 mg/kg (intravenous) and indomethacin, 25 mg/kg (intravenous) were assessed. Of six nitroglycerin-treated rabbits, one died of ventricular fibrillation prior to arteriographic study. The remaining five developed ECG abnormalities (single ventricular premature beats, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and ST segment deviation) upon challenge with ergonovine or indomethacin. Neither agent evoked ECG changes in control rabbits. In contrast, the degree of luminal diameter reduction in epicardial coronary arteries provoked by ergonovine or indomethacin did not differ between control and nitroglycerin-treated animals. Focal coronary artery spasm was not observed in any rabbit. Our results demonstrate that selective coronary arteriography in rabbits is feasible and that changes in vessel caliber may be assessed from images thus obtained. Data from this study indicate that ergonovine- and indomethacin-induced ECG abnormalities observed in nitroglycerin-treated rabbits cannot be ascribed to epicardial coronary artery spasm.\r"

Other litters were allowed to stay with their own mothers, which received a control or restricted diet as during pregnancy (C/C and 50/50). Pups nurtured by restricted dams had reduced body weights, intestinal lengths, hepatic and pancreatic weights, and specific activities of pancreatic lipase and small intestinal brush border sucrase and maltase. Small intestinal lactase levels were higher in the groups of pups from mothers restricted during lactation. In nearly all cases, the 50/C group was the most severely affected while the C/50 group was intermediate between the C/C and 50/50 groups.\r"

Fat oxidation was followed by indirect calorimetry. Maximal oxidative metabolism of fatty acids was achieved with supplementation of L-carnitine in small amounts (10 mg X kg-1 X d-1). This was demonstrated by a decrease of the RQ and of the serum concentrations of fatty acids and by an increase of beta-OH-butyric acid. Decreased liver free and long-chain acylcarnitine and increased short-chain acylcarnitine concentrations in this group also demonstrate an increased ketogenicity. This ketogenic effect of carnitine decreases when higher concentrations of carnitine are used. This study demonstrates that the ketogenic effect of carnitine is dose dependent.\r"

Especially for multiallele multiloci systems, this technique has advantages over traditional formulae methods in that it replaces tedious (and, in some cases, impossible) computations with simple data file manipulations, and it avoids introducing quantities such as gametic disequilibrium and recombination fraction that are difficult to measure. Exclusion rates for standard and one-parent paternity cases are given for three racial groups (Caucasians, blacks, and Hispanics) in four genetic systems (HLA, ABO, MNSs, and Rh). Beside the method, of interest are our findings of higher HLA exclusion rates (93.25% for Caucasians, 94.62% for blacks, and 95.82% for Hispanics) compared with rates previously reported and high combined exclusion rates (89.59% for Caucasians, 91.65% for blacks, and 92.54% for Hispanics) in one-parent paternity cases.\r"

Sixteen symptomatic patients underwent interval hydrogen breath tests using whole milk as substrate. Each study was repeated with the addition of 250 mg of beta-D-galactosidase derived from Aspergillus oryzae (Lactrase) given orally with the milk. Subsequently seven of those 11 patients who did not normalize their hydrogen excretion with 250 mg of Lactrase were available to be restudied with a 500-mg dose. Mean cumulative and peak hydrogen excretions were calculated for the baseline (milk alone), 250 mg, and 500 mg Lactrase groups. Significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) decreases in cumulative and peak hydrogen excretion were noted between the 500 mg Lactrase versus the baseline group, but not between the 250 mg versus baseline group. Five of the 16 (31%) symptomatic lactase-deficient patients normalized their hydrogen excretion after 250 mg of Lactrase; four of seven (57%) who had not normalized on 250 mg, normalized their hydrogen excretion with 500 mg of Lactrase. A different pattern was observed in the incidence of symptoms. Five of the nine patients (56%) whose hydrogen excretion normalized with the addition of Lactrase at either dosage became asymptomatic after milk ingestion; in addition, three patients who did not normalize their hydrogen also became asymptomatic. We conclude that oral Lactrase in sufficient dosage temporarily reverses lactose malabsorption in some patients.\r"

When compared with normal subjects (180 +/- 12 pg/ml), the plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide in cirrhotic patients (349 +/- 64 pg/ml) were significantly elevated (p less than 0.001) but not in other disease groups. In patients with chronic liver disease the plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide were correlated significantly with plasma renin activity but not with plasma aldosterone, and furthermore showed a negative correlation with indocyanine green disappearance rate. These results suggest that the increased plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide, which appear to be associated with an increase in plasma renin activity and with hepatic dysfunction, may participate in maintaining homeostasis of sodium and fluid volume in patients with chronic liver disease.\r"

Eight of ten patients with acute renal failure (ARF) obtained recovery of renal function, and in five of them serum creatinine concentration returned to normal. The remaining two patients died before the effect of treatment could be evaluated. Eleven of 13 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) had substantial, albeit incomplete, improvement in renal function. The extent of functional recovery appeared to depend on the type of renal lesions, probably related to the duration of exposure to light chains. The median survival of the whole series of patients was 9 months, and five patients lived longer than 3 years. No clear-cut difference in survival was found between the group with ARF and that with CRF, although the latter presented higher values of serum creatinine at the time of diagnosis and residual renal insufficiency after the completion of treatment. Moreover, no significantly different survival times were found when the group with complete recovery of renal function was compared to that with minor improvement. Thus, renal failure, with the availability of effective forms of treatment of uremia, did not play a major prognostic role in our series. In contrast, the response to chemotherapy appeared to be the outstanding factor conditioning the duration of survival in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays an integral role in the control of BP and is mediated by enzymatic transformation of substances in the renin-angiotensin cascade. Inhibitors of various reactions in this cascade have been shown experimentally to reduce elevated BP. The first such compound to become available for clinical use was the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Captopril reduces BP, with the expected decrease in plasma angiotensin II concentration and increases in renin and angiotensin I levels, but there is also evidence for a non-renin-dependent mechanism of action. In particular, according to cell culture data, captopril stimulates an increase in the synthesis of vasodilatory prostaglandins. Because enalapril, another angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, does not augment in vitro synthesis of prostaglandins, this effect may be unique to the chemical structure of captopril rather than inherent to all such inhibitors. Studies using animal models of hypertension support this hypothesis. Captopril may also influence prostaglandin synthesis by reducing inactivation of bradykinin.\r"

  ".W": "Studies addressing the mechanisms of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) action within the kidney are reviewed. The magnitude of the natriuretic response to ANP initially suggested inhibition of renal sodium transport. It now appears, however, that the renal response to ANP is largely dependent on ANP-induced alterations in renal hemodynamics. At the glomerulus, ANP-induced afferent arteriolar dilatation and efferent arteriolar constriction produce a rise in the glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure and thus an increase in the filtration fraction and glomerular filtration rate. Furthermore, angiotensin II-induced increments in renal perfusion pressure markedly augment ANP-induced NaCl excretion, whereas increments in peritubular oncotic pressure or reductions in renal perfusion pressure nearly abolish this natriuretic effect, thereby suggesting that changes in the peritubular physical factors, which govern tubule fluid reabsorption, are required to elicit the natriuretic action of ANP. In addition, increments in papillary vasa recta hydraulic pressures during ANP infusion argue for an important influence of ANP on fluid exchange in the renal papilla. There also is recent evidence to suggest that ANP directly inhibits papillary collecting duct NaCl reabsorption. This action of ANP is thought to contribute to the enhanced renal excretion of sodium-rich urine in response to ANP. Finally, in two models of chronic extracellular volume expansion, namely, mineralocorticoid excess and a reduction in nephron number with a high sodium intake, endogenous plasma ANP levels increased significantly above control levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hypoparathyroidism was diagnosed in nine members of a kindred of three generations. This study investigated why these persons were asymptomatic and without developmental abnormalities, in contrast to the common presentation of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. In the hypocalcemic subjects, serum calcium level was 7.4 +/- 0.8 mg/dl (mean +/- SD) and ionized serum calcium level was 3.48 +/- 0.21 mg/dl. Immunoreactive parathyroid hormone values were inappropriately low. Injection of EDTA in one patient lowered ionized calcium levels, but immunoreactive parathyroid hormone values did not rise. Serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and other vitamin D metabolites were normal or elevated and substantially higher than in other hypoparathyroid states. The normally observed positive correlation between the fasting urinary calcium/creatinine ratio and serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D that reflects the dependence of net bone resorption on 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was upheld in hypoparathyroid patients. It is proposed that the subjects with familial hypoparathyroidism in this kindred had moderate asymptomatic hypocalcemia without developmental abnormalities because normal or elevated serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels enhanced intestinal calcium absorption. This may represent one point in the spectrum of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. Alternately, both the moderate degree of hypocalcemia and the normal serum calcitriol values could have been related to mild, partial hypoparathyroidism, which could have been inherited in this kindred.\r"

A monoclonal IgM lambda cryoglobulin was identified. It retained reactivity with the fibrin(ogen) degradation products reagent, but failed to react with human IgG by latex fixation. Binding activity for rabbit IgG (and absence of binding activity for human, goat, and bovine IgG) was also demonstrable by double diffusion in agarose, and by enzyme-linked immunoassay. By enzyme-linked immunoassay, binding of both F(ab)2 and Fab and, to a lesser extent, Fc fragments of rabbit IgG was found. Increased binding of heat-denatured rabbit IgG was observed, without inhibition by similarly denatured IgG of other species. The false-positive fibrin(ogen) degradation products reaction in the serum of this patient was due to a unique monoclonal IgM lambda cryoglobulin with warm-reactive antibody activity for an epitope displayed on native and denatured rabbit IgG, but absent on native or denatured human, goat, or bovine IgG, and present in both F(ab)2 and Fc regions of the IgG molecule.\r"

  ".W": "Norfloxacin is an orally absorbed fluoroquinolone antibacterial with a fluorine at position 6 and a piperazine ring at position 7. These changes have resulted in a marked enhancement (compared with that of the older quinolones) of in vitro antibacterial activity. Specifically, the antibacterial spectrum of norfloxacin includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as enteric pathogens. Norfloxacin is also active against both penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Relative to its activity against gram-negative bacteria, norfloxacin is somewhat less active against gram-positive cocci. In general, the staphylococci are more susceptible to the drug than are the streptococci. As with all fluoroquinolones, norfloxacin's activity against anaerobic bacteria is poor. For urinary tract bacterial isolates, the following Bauer-Kirby disk diffusion zone-size breakpoints have been proposed: greater than or equal to 17 mm, susceptible; 13 to 16 mm, intermediate; less than or equal to 12 mm, resistant. Bacteria with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml are considered susceptible; those with MICs greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml are considered resistant to norfloxacin. The mechanism of action of norfloxacin involves inhibition of the A subunit of the important bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase, which is essential for DNA replication. Plasmid-mediated resistance to the fluoroquinolones is not encountered. Further, although some cross-resistance within the fluoroquinolone class has occurred, there is little cross-resistance between norfloxacin and antibiotics of other classes.\r"

In two patients, hypothyroidism was transient and spontaneously resolved; in one of them, it was recurrent.

  ".W": "The effect of the cyclooxygenase inhibitors, indomethacin and ibuprofen, on diffusional transfer in the human placenta was assessed with the dual-perfused isolated placental lobe. Antipyrine, a freely diffusible substance, was used as an indicator of placental transfer efficiency. Each inhibitor (100 mumol/L) was perfused for 30 minutes after a baseline period, resulting in a significant reduction in antipyrine clearance. During a subsequent washout period, ibuprofen-inhibited antipyrine clearance returned to baseline values, whereas indomethacin-inhibited clearance remained reduced. An additional 30 minutes perfusion of 500 mumol/L of ibuprofen resulted in a further reduction in antipyrine clearance compared with 100 mumol/L of ibuprofen, suggesting a dosage-related effect. The perfusion of each inhibitor caused a reduced production of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (the stable metabolite of prostacyclin) in the fetal circulation. The simultaneous perfusion of carbacyclin, a prostacyclin analogue, at 100 nmol/L and 1 mumol/L resulted in a dosage-dependent reversal of the effects of ibuprofen (500 mumol/L) on antipyrine clearance. The results indicate that the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity reduces placental transfer and that the effects of these inhibitors are reversed by carbacyclin. This study suggests that the use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors during pregnancy could compromise the developing fetus by reducing placental transfer.\r"

  ".W": "This study examines the immunohistologic profiles of a large series of histologically proven benign and malignant lymphoproliferative processes in order to define immunophenotypic criteria useful in the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Using a method of analysis relying solely on immunoarchitectural features of a given case, the authors were able to define immunologic criteria capable of differentiating benign from malignant lymphoid processes independent from conventional morphologic analysis. In general, these criteria involved identification of abnormal expression or loss of antigens in B- and T-lineage populations. Among B-lineage populations the following features were associated with malignant histology: 1) light-chain-restricted B lineage, 2) light chain -B lineage, 3) Leu-1+ B lineage, 4) L60+ B lineage, 5) 41H+, Ki-67+ B lineage, 6) loss of pan-B antigens, and 7) LFA-1-B lineage. Among T-cell populations outside the thymus, phenotypes associated with malignancy included 1) loss of pan-T antigens (including loss of the beta chain of the T-cell antigen receptor), 2) coexpression or loss of T-subset antigens, 3) Leu-6+ T-lineage, and 4) MB-1+ T lineage. Application of these criteria to a series of nearly 500 cases of lymphoma indicated that over 90% of B-lineage and about 80% of T-lineage neoplasms manifested immunophenotypic abnormalities that could distinguish them from benign, reactive lymphoid processes. It is concluded that immunophenotypic analysis of lymphoproliferative lesions is sufficiently sensitive and specific to confirm the histologic diagnosis of lymphoma in the vast majority of cases seen in clinical practice. Furthermore, in difficult cases or those with limited material or poor histology, immunophenotypic analysis may be the only means of making a definitive diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "The membrane attack complex (MAC) of complement (C) has been shown to stimulate prostaglandin (PG) and thromboxane (Tx) synthesis in nucleated cells. Because glomerular epithelial cell injury and altered permeability in rat membranous nephropathy are mediated by the MAC, the authors examined whether MAC-induced proteinuria is linked to glomerular prostanoid synthesis. In kidneys containing non-nephritogenic, non-C-fixing gamma 2 sheep anti-Fx1A (planted antigen) that were perfused in vitro with C-fixing guinea pig anti-sheep IgG and a C source (fresh human plasma, 50% vol/vol in buffered bovine albumin), heavy proteinuria developed, reaching 4.27 +/- 1.20 mg/min/g at 100-120 minutes (n = 8). Cyclooxygenase blockade with 10(-4) M indomethacin (n = 6) inhibited urinary PGE2 excretion (569 +/- 47 to 124 +/- 18 pg/min/g, P less than 0.001) and lowered proteinuria (1.06 +/- 0.42 mg/min/g, P less than 0.001). Reduced protein excretion (0.88 +/- 0.12 mg/min/g, n = 6, P less than 0.001) also occurred with inhibition of Tx synthetase by OKY-046, 10(-4) M, a dose that was shown in separate perfusions to inhibit urinary TxB2 excretion by greater than 85%. Control kidneys, without planted antigen and perfused with anti-sheep IgG and plasma, excreted 0.30 +/- 0.05 mg protein/min/g (n = 6). Because inulin clearance was reduced by indomethacin, renal hemodynamic factors may have contributed to the reduction in proteinuria observed with this drug. However, insulin clearance was not significantly affected by OKY-046, implying that inhibition of Tx synthetase reduced proteinuria independently of changes in renal hemodynamics. Thus, proteinuria in rat membranous nephropathy is due to MAC-dependent glomerular epithelial injury and is mediated, in part, by Tx.\r"

Integrity of cholinergic regulation was tested by assaying the GH response to a presynaptic cholinergic challenge.

  ".W": "Domestically bred South American guinea pigs received 3 to 5 immunizing intradermal inocula of 28 X 10(6) live attenuated Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes (TCC strain) per kg. These inocula were unable to produce patent infections or to propagate through vectors. Groups of experimental and control guinea pigs were exposed to natural T. cruzi infection in a field yard for periods of up to 551 days. Xenodiagnoses were applied periodically to all animals. This showed that the incidence of natural T. cruzi infection was significantly lowered at various periods post-exposure. The final proportion of infected animals was 39% (20/51) among vaccinees vs. 63% (32/51) among controls (P less than 0.02). The protective effect was exerted particularly upon males and lasted for over a year in one experimental series (infection in 1/7 vaccinees vs. 6/7 controls, P = 0.014). Vaccination reduced vector transmission rates from 38% to 18% (P less than 0.001). These results agree with previous laboratory experiments in showing a partial resistance which does not eliminate residual T. cruzi infection. However, the field work indicates that even this kind of resistance may have epidemiological impact, reducing both the number of reservoirs spreading the disease and the rate of vector transmission.\r"

In contrast, titers in sera from patients with visceral leishmaniasis, African trypanosomiasis, and autoimmune disorders, subjected to similar treatment, showed remarkable decline. Accordingly, a lower cut-off point for Chagas' disease serological negativity could be taken resulting in a higher sensitivity (95.6%); the specificity was 94.7%. Similar specificities were obtained with Leishmania donovani chagasi and L. d. donovani antigens applied to homologous visceral leishmaniasis and heterologous Chagas' sera. Of 316 nonchagasic sera, only 3 with leptospirosis and 1 with leprosy showed seropositive titers prior to and after 2-mercaptoethanol treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Upon exposure to Entamoeba histolytica antigen, lymphocytes from patients treated for amebic liver abscess produce lymphokines which activate monocyte-derived macrophages to kill E. histolytica trophozoites. We now demonstrate that gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is produced by these stimulated lymphocytes and is sufficient but not exclusively necessary to activate monocyte-derived macrophage amebicidal activity. Supernatants from mononuclear cells of 7 patients when stimulated with amebic antigen contained more IFN-gamma than comparable supernatants derived from control cells (1,862 U/ml vs. 174 U/ml geometric means, P less than 0.01); IFN-gamma levels were similar in patient and control supernatants following concanavalin A stimulation. Macrophages activated solely by partially purified IFN-gamma or recombinant human IFN-gamma (300 U/ml) killed 47% of virulent amebae by 6 hr at 37 degrees C. Monocyte-derived macrophages stimulated with lymphokines elicited by amebic antigen or concanavalin A killed 48% and 57% of axenic E. histolytica trophozoites, respectively, over 6 hr at 37 degrees C (P less than 0.001 for each compared to control). Macrophages incubated with the identical lymphokines, but in the presence of monoclonal antibody to IFN-gamma, were only able to kill 18% and 27% of amebae, respectively, at 6 hr (P less than 0.05 to control or when antibody to IFN-gamma was not present). If antibody to IFN-gamma was added to the stimulating lymphokine, more macrophages died during interaction with amebae (P less than 0.05). In summary, IFN-gamma has a major but not exclusive role in activating human monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro to kill virulent E. histolytica trophozoites.\r"

The inability to experimentally manipulate human beings necessitates the use of surrogate variables, i.e., number of eggs per gram of feces, as an indicator of worm burden. This study reanalyzes data from quantitative autopsies performed in Egypt by Cheever and colleagues on individuals with active Schistosoma mansoni infections. Exploratory regression analysis of the relationship of female worms recovered to eggs/g of feces and of female worms to eggs retained in host tissues suggests a linear relationship in both cases. Over the observed range of female worms recovered from an individual human being, the estimated worm fecundity, as measured by the number of eggs either in feces or retained in tissues per female worm, is not significantly different from a constant value. Hence, density-dependent fecundity of S. mansoni in the human host, as suggested by others, is not demonstrated in these data.\r"

  ".U": "87268317\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the relation between the size of circumoval granulomas and hepatic fibrosis, a variety of mouse strains infected with Schistosoma mansoni were examined and the number of eggs in the tissues, the fibrotic responses to the eggs, and the volume of the granulomas were determined. Marked differences in granuloma volume and in hepatic fibrosis were found between mouse strains, and those strains with the largest granulomas also showed the most hepatic fibrosis. On the other hand no significant correlation between granuloma size and hepatic fibrosis was found in the progeny of the F2 generation and backcrosses between F1 mice and the parental strains when crosses were made between Nmri mice (high granuloma volume and high fibrosis) and C57BL/6 mice (low granuloma volume and low fibrosis). Hepatic fibrosis per egg decreased with increasing infection intensity while granuloma volume was unaffected, indicating that fibrosis and granuloma size are at least in part modulated by different factors. The number of eggs found in the tissues per worm pair and the proportion of eggs in the liver also decreased as infection intensity increased. Some influence of the major histocompatibility complex on both granuloma size and fibrosis was found. Congenic mice on the C57BL/10 and C3H/HeSn backgrounds showed larger granulomas in H-2b than in H-2k mice, but no such correlation was found in comparing C57BL/6 mice with B6.H-2k mice. Less hepatic fibrosis was found in B10.M (H-2f), B10.SM (H-2v), and B10.RIII (H-2r) animals than in C57BL/10 mice. The regulation of granuloma size and of hepatic fibrosis is clearly complex and involves genes both outside of and within the major histocompatibility complex.\r"

C57BL/6 mice were immunized with either 50 Krad-irradiated cercariae or a soluble worm antigenic extract injected intradermally in conjunction with the adjuvant BCG. A series of cercarial challenges (40 cercariae per exposure), beginning approximately one month after immunization, was given at 4-week intervals. To prevent any contribution of egg-related pathology, the mice were exposed to male cercariae only. The results showed that highly significant levels of protection developed at all times after cercarial challenge. Regardless of the type of immunization or the number of cercarial challenges, the levels of protection which appeared after one, two, three, or four challenge exposures were nearly identical, and equalled those in mice exposed at a single time to a cumulative total of the several exposures. As expected, titers of anti-schistosome antibodies were higher in the immunized and challenged groups than in those challenged alone, and titers increased anamnestically after challenge infection. However, increased antibody titers were not associated with increased resistance in trickle challenged mice. Overall, we showed that the level of vaccine-induced immunity does not change, under these conditions, in the face of repeated cercarial challenges. Also, these results show that single mass cercarial challenges may legitimately be used in experimental situations to assess the effectiveness of vaccines which might be used in subjects repeatedly exposed to cercariae in field situations.\r"

Existing scoring systems require a well-trained observer to perform a thorough chart review to complete manual scoring forms. We have designed a new system in which computerized intensity-intervention scores are automatically extracted from electronic intensive care unit flowsheets, eliminating both manual labor and potential observer variation. In prospective studies, these computerized scores correlated well with manual TISS scores, intensive care unit mortality, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay, and a subjective classification of patients to graded levels of hospital care. Such automated scores may be used for real-time allocation of health care resources and normalization of prospective studies for severity of illness.\r"

In the epidural group, the slope of the ventilatory response to CO2 decreased significantly from 2.48 +/- 1.05 to 1.77 +/- 0.7, 1.74 +/- 0.7, and 2.07 +/- 0.74 L X min-1 X mm Hg-1 at 30, 60, and 120 min after injection (chi +/- SD, P less than or equal to 0.05), respectively. At each time of the study, plasma fentanyl levels were significantly lower in the epidural group than in the intramuscular group (P less than or equal to 0.05).

Determination of CSF values began 2 h after the onset of hypocapnia and continued for an additional 3 h. Two separate methods were used to determine Vf: modified open ventriculocisternal perfusion and closed ventriculocisternal perfusion. Dogs were examined both during hypocapnia plus anesthesia with halothane (0.8%) and nitrous oxide (66%), and during hypocapnia plus sedation with nitrous oxide (66%) and halothane (0.15%) combined with bupivacaine (0.75%) infiltration of wound edges. There were no differences in Vf measured by the two methods. At the first measurable time period, mean Vf values during hypocapnia and halothane anesthesia, 32 +/- 9 and 35 +/- 10 microliters/min (mean +/- SD), were lower than mean Vf values during hypocapnia and nitrous oxide sedation, 48 +/- 11 and 49 +/- 8 microliters/min. Vf did not change significantly during 3 h of hypocapnia. For both halothane anesthesia and nitrous oxide sedation, mean Vf values during hypocapnia were not significantly different from Vf values previously reported during normocapnia, 31 +/- 12 and 33 +/- 12 microliters/min and 44 +/- 13 and 47 +/- 14 microliters/min, respectively. The results indicate that prolonged hypocapnia does not decrease Vf, and, therefore, reduction of Vf is probably not one of the causes for reduction of elevated CSF pressure by prolonged hypocapnia. Regarding the other data on CSF dynamics, CSF pressure at hypocapnia was similar to that at normocapnia, suggesting that hypocapnia did not affect resistance to reabsorption of CSF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

If halothane reduces the susceptibility to hypoxia, it should lower the critical levels of both O2 delivery (DO2) and arterial oxygen tension (pO2). To test this hypothesis, 12 newborn lambs were anesthetized with either fentanyl and pancuronium (control group) or fentanyl, pancuronium, and 1.1% (1 MAC) halothane (halothane group). Baseline measurements of hemoglobin, cardiac output (CO), arterial and mixed-venous pO2, and saturation were obtained on FIO2 1.0, and repeated with FIO2 .21, .15, and .10. O2 delivery (CO X CaO2) and O2 consumption were calculated from measured parameters. Critical levels were selected using a system of repetitive linear regression. Halothane decreased baseline O2 consumption (12.1 +/- 0.7 to 8.4 +/- 0.4 cc X kg-1 X min-1, x +/- SEM, P less than .001, unpaired t test), but caused similar reductions in cardiac output (235 +/- 15 to 132 +/- 15 cc X kg-1 X min-1, P less than .001) and O2 delivery (29.2 +/- 2.9 to 20.2 +/- 1.6 cc X kg-1 X min-1, P less than .05). Addition of halothane decreased the critical level of O2 delivery from 17.9 to 14.3 cc X kg-1 X min-1, but had no effect on the critical level of arterial pO2 (control group, 47 mmHg halothane, 46 mmHg). Peripheral oxygen utilization was mildly reduced during halothane anesthesia, as evidenced by a decrease in oxygen extraction (control group O2 extraction rate = 0.63; halothane group O2 extraction = 0.51, P less than .05, unpaired t test).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three methods of recording differential blood flow were compared during unilateral lung hypoxia: electromagnetic flow measurement, flow probes being fitted onto each main pulmonary artery after thoracotomy (QPr); SF6 elimination from each lung, the inert gas being continuously infused into a central vein (QSF6); and CO2 elimination (QCO2). During control conditions (100% O2 to both lungs), the test lung QPr was 54% of cardiac output, and corresponding QSF6 and QCO2 were 56% and 52%, respectively. Hypoxic challenge with 8% O2 to the test lung reduced QPR, QSF6, and QCO2 by 25%, 27%, and 7%, respectively. Ventilation of the test lung with pure nitrogen reduced its blood flow further, QPr, QSF6, and QCO2 being reduced by 39%, 42%, and 23%, respectively, from initial control. A strong correlation between test lung QPr and QSF6 was seen with a slope of 0.90 (r:0.89, P less than 0.001). Only 60% of the reduction in test lung blood flow was detected by CO2 elimination, as compared to electromagnetic flow measurement or SF6 elimination. The poor results obtained with CO2 elimination can be explained by its dependence on the ventilation-perfusion ratio and the effect of oxygen tension on the CO2 binding capacity of blood (Haldane effect). The findings emphasize the necessity of using an inert, poorly soluble gas for the measurement of separate lung blood flow.\r"

In order to delineate the working mechanism of this kind of treatment, expression of interleukin 2 receptors (IL-2 R) on house dust and phytohemagglutinin-activated lymphocytes was compared in 15 normals, 18 newly diagnosed and 28 hyposensitized asthmatic children. Interleukin 2 receptors were analyzed by fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS), uptake of 125I-labelled anti-human IL-2R monoclonal antibody (anti-Tac), and proliferative response to recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2). The results showed that there was no difference in the expression of IL-2R among three studied groups, if IL-2R were detected by anti-Tac. When compared to the other two groups, house dust-activated lymphoblasts from new patients proliferated vigorously in the presence of very low rIL-2 (0.02 to 1.0 nM), suggesting the presence of much higher numbers of high affinity IL-2R. Decreased high affinity IL-2R may partly explain the diminished lymphoproliferation to allergen after long-term hyposensitization.\r"

  ".U": "87268863\r", 
  ".W": "Although pulmonary fibrin deposition and coagulation abnormalities have been observed in acute lung injury in humans, their role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disorders is unclear. In order to gain further insights into the role of the coagulation in lung injury, we examined the relationship between procoagulant activity in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids and the evolution of bleomycin-induced lung injury in marmosets. The BAL procoagulant activity was increased at 1, 2, and 4 wk after bleomycin challenge compared with that in control subjects, and it was capable of shortening the recalcification times of plasmas deficient in factor VII and factor VIII but not in factor X. This profile suggested the presence in BAL of an activator of factor X. Activation of purified human factor X by BAL was demonstrated by measuring the amidolytic activity of the generated factor Xa on its N-benzoyl-L-isoleucyl L-glutamyl-glycyl-L-argenine-p-nitroanilide substrate. Factor X activating activity was increased in BAL at 2 wk after bleomycin challenge. Cleavage of 125I-labeled human factor X by BAL from bleomycin-challenged marmosets yielded a 55,500 Mr product that comigrated with factor Xa, the appearance of which correlated strongly with amidolytic evidence of factor Xa activity. Electron microscopy of the lungs of animals from all groups revealed pulmonary fibrin deposition at 2 wk after bleomycin challenge, at the time of increased BAL procoagulant and factor X activating activity. The BAL procoagulant activity was completely sedimentable by ultracentrifugation and was inhibited by concanavalin A and phospholipase C. Activation of purified factor X by BAL was inhibited by monospecific polyclonal goat and rabbit antibodies to human factor VII as well as antibody to bovine tissue factor, demonstrating that factor X activating activity in BAL was attributable to tissue factor associated with material similar to factors VII or VIIa. We conclude that procoagulant activity in BAL increases after bleomycin challenge in marmosets and is attributable to activation of factor X by tissue factor associated with factors VII or VIIa-like material. Increased BAL procoagulant activity is temporally associated with pulmonary fibrin deposition and pulmonary fibrosis during bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury in the marmoset.\r"

Fatty acid oxygenases controlling the first committed step in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes are suppressed in normal tissues but are activated by lipid hydroperoxides. Because hydroperoxides are also produced by the action of the oxygenases, they provide positive feedback amplification during eicosanoid biosynthesis. This relationship among membrane lipids, lipid peroxides, and eicosanoids can lead to amplification of the intercellular signals mediated by cytokines and immune globulins in ways that create hyperresponsive states and lead to pathophysiology.\r"

Although this PGE2 is probably intramurally produced. a subsidiary role for blood-borne PGE2 and PGI2 is not excluded. PGE2 synthetic activity develops early in the developing ductus and is greater in immature than in mature tissues. Ductus sensitivity to PGE2 is greatly diminished after exposure to oxygen. Arachidonic acid (the precursor of PGE2) may inactivates cytochrome P-450, completely reverses the contractile tension of the DA at both low (4 to 12 torr) and high (511 to 712 torr) oxygen tension and is equally effective in the presence and absence of indomethacin. Carbon monoxide-induced relaxation occurs with a PCO/PO2 ratio of 0.27 and is reversed by white light and by monochromatic light with maximal reversal seen at 450 nm wavelength. Both these findings favor involvement of a cytochrome P-450. Metyrapone and phenylimidazole, chemical inhibitors of cytochrome P-450, also relax the ductus. These findings suggest that ductus tone is controlled through the opposing activities of cyclooxygenase and monooxygenase products of AA. The former predominate in the fetus, and the latter at birth when they induce closure/\r"

The 1524 patients admitted to the SICU during a 12-month period had a mean TISS of 3.03 and a mean APS of 13. The average length of stay (LOS) was 3.75 days. Of the 1524 patients, 97 (6.4%) died. The number of nonsurvivors increased with higher TISS and APS scores (P less than 0.001). There were no deaths in the TISS Category 1 patients or in the APS 0-5 group. Mortality rates dramatically increased with APS greater than 20 (P less than 0.001). There were 1286 patients with APS less than 20, and 24 (2%) of these patients died, whereas 73 (31%) of 238 patients with APS greater than 20 died. Nonsurvivors had a mean TISS of 3.6, mean APS of 27, and LOS of 4.88 days, all of which totals were higher than the survivors' totals. In this study population, risk of death was one in three if the APS was greater than 20.

In 22 no cause for elevated serum ALT levels was found. The presence or absence of risk of acquiring hepatitis did not correlate with the pattern of ALT elevations or the identification of another cause for the elevated ALT levels. In 92 blood donors with an initially elevated ALT level, two-thirds have intermittent or persistent elevations; most approximately 20% have no apparent cause for the elevations other than possible non-A, non-B hepatitis. These findings may be helpful in counseling and following blood donors with elevated ALT levels.\r"

The pooled results of 11 trials that were randomized or quasi-randomized showed trends suggesting that total parenteral nutrition reduced the risk for complications from major surgery (p = 0.21) and fatalities (p = 0.21). Consideration of these pooled estimates of the effectiveness of this intervention must be offset by the poor quality of the trials' methodologies and the iatrogenic complications (pneumothorax, septicemia) that occurred at a pooled rate of 0.067. Alternately, other design flaws, such as the failure to exclude patients who were not malnourished from the trials, may have limited the ability of these trials to show the effectiveness of total parenteral nutrition. The evidence available up to August 1986 shows that the routine use of perioperative total parenteral nutrition in unselected patients having major surgery is not justified; however, this intervention may be helpful in subgroups of these patients who are at high risk.\r"

In recent years our understanding of the organization and function of two prominent second-messenger systems has progressed rapidly--the adenylate cyclase and phosphoinositide systems. Guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins, which are especially abundant in brain, couple transmitter receptors to the key second-messenger generating enzymes in both of these systems. Whereas activation of adenylate cyclase produces a single intracellular messenger, cyclic AMP, stimulation of the phosphoinositide system generates at least two, inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol trisphosphate mobilizes calcium from intracellular stores, and diacylglycerol, like cyclic adenosine monophosphate, activates a phosphorylating enzyme, protein kinase C. These second-messenger systems are particularly enriched in the brain where they modulate many aspects of synaptic transmission.\r"

Abnormal interictal EEGs, multiple seizure types, mental retardation, or developmental delay were more likely in patients with atypical absence seizures than in patients with typical absence seizures. Both types of absence seizures usually had a clear onset and cessation. Atypical absence seizures lasted significantly longer than did typical absence seizures. Automatisms occurred more frequently in typical absence seizures than in atypical ones, while decreases in postural tone or tonic activity occurred more frequently in atypical absence seizures. Receptive and expressive speech were retained in some patients during both types of seizures. This study demonstrates that typical and atypical absence seizures are not discrete entities but rather form a continuum. No single clinical feature can adequately distinguish the two seizure types.\r"

The relative efficacy of imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of such intrauterine infections was compared with that of cefazolin and ampicillin for the treatment of infections caused by Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis, respectively. Treatment with imipenem-cilastatin significantly inhibited the proliferation of E. coli and S. faecalis in uteri, as compared with the proliferation in untreated controls. Cefazolin failed to affect the E. coli infection. With the S. faecalis infection, ampicillin effectively reduced bacterial growth, as compared with that in untreated controls. However, ampicillin was inferior to and comparable to imipenem-cilastatin in progesterone-treated virgin rats and postpartum rats, respectively. A further experiment with S. faecalis infections in rats made neutropenic by intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide showed that the therapeutic effectiveness of imipenem-cilastatin was superior to that of ampicillin and was not influenced by neutropenia. Our results suggest that imipenem-cilastatin may be a useful agent for the treatment of obstetric and gynecologic infections.\r"

  ".W": "Two genetically distinct classes of norfloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO4009 mutants were isolated spontaneously. Two norfloxacin resistance genes, nfxA and nfxB, were mapped hex-9001 and leu-9005 and between pro-9031 and ilv-9023, respectively, on the P. aeruginosa PAO chromosome. The nfxA gene was shown to be an allele of nalA by transductional analysis with bacteriophage F116L. The nfxB mutant showed a 16-fold increase in resistance to norfloxacin and a slight increase in resistance to nalidixic acid. The nfxB mutant was unique in that it showed hypersusceptibility to beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. This mutant had about a threefold-lower rate of norfloxacin uptake than that of the wild-type strain or nfxA mutant. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins demonstrated the appearance of a 54,000-dalton protein in the nfxB mutant. These findings suggested that the norfloxacin resistance mechanism in the nfxB mutant might be an alteration in outer membrane permeability to norfloxacin.\r"

Heat-inactivated donor serum was spiked with gentamicin, piperacillin, or a combination at concentrations representative of levels in serum and tested against five P. aeruginosa strains isolated from blood. The SBR assay was performed as follows: colony counts in test samples (control, gentamicin, piperacillin, and combination) were determined at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after inoculation of a test strain. Log10 CFU per milliliter was plotted versus time, and linear regression analysis was performed; the slope of the regression line was defined as the SBR. The SBRs of agents alone and in combination were compared statistically. The SBR of gentamicin was dependent on the serum concentration. The combination of gentamicin and piperacillin always resulted in a higher SBR than did either drug alone. However, this difference was not statistically significant for highly gentamicin-susceptible strains (MIC, less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) until the gentamicin concentration was reduced below the MIC. For a gentamicin-resistant strain (MIC, 8 micrograms/ml), the combination of gentamicin and piperacillin produced mean SBRs similar to that found with gentamicin-susceptible strains. These results provide evidence that the SBR assay may be a useful method of evaluating antibiotic interactions, since it can be done by using serum and since it compares the antibacterial activity of drugs statistically rather than requiring arbitrary criteria to define interactions.\r"

Three patients were dropped from the study within 4 days of enrollment for reasons unrelated to drug administration. The total daily dose of ceftazidime administered was restricted by protocol design and was independent of the body weight of the patient. Thus, for datum analysis, patients were separated into three ceftazidime dosage groups (denoted as range of milligrams per kilogram per dose): group 1, 22 to 44.5; group 2, 46.3 to 56.6; and group 3, 66.7 to 80.6. Ceftazidime monotherapy had no effect on sputum colony counts for any Pseudomonas cepacia isolate. In contrast, a substantial reduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa sputum colony counts was observed, and from 19 to 31% of isolates were suppressed greater than or equal to 10(5) CFU/ml after 14 days of therapy. Bacterial resistance in vitro was not observed, although a trend for increasing ceftazidime MICs was observed for group 1 patients (P less than 0.05). Overall, clinical response appeared independent of drug dose, and no relationship could be identified between the reduction in P. aeruginosa sputum colony counts and clinical outcome. Adverse effects of ceftazidime were mild and transient, necessitating drug discontinuation in one patient. These data suggest that the clinical response to ceftazidime in patients with cystic fibrosis may be maximal with 50 mg/kg per dose (150 mg/kg per day) up to a total daily dose of 6 g.\r"

Cross-resistance between imipenem and other beta-lactam compounds was not observed. In all imipenem-resistant variants, induction of chromosomal beta-lactamase by imipenem was markedly diminished compared with that in the susceptible parent strain. This was not the case for other inducers such as ampicillin or cefoxitin, suggesting an impaired uptake of imipenem as an explanation for resistance. Analysis of the outer membrane proteins revealed a marked decrease of either a 46- or a 45-kilodalton protein. The lipopolysaccharide of the outer membrane in the imipenem-resistant variants was not altered.\r"

We have examined representative subsets of 107 MLS-resistant isolates for the molecular nature of the resistance determinant, the erm gene, by dot blot and Southern hybridization analysis. All of 35 S. aureus isolates examined and 39 of 42 coagulase-negative isolates examined were found to harbor the ermA or ermC evolutionary variant. Genes of the ermC class occurred exclusively on a small plasmid similar to or indistinguishable from one (pNE131) previously described in S. epidermidis. Genes of the ermA class occurred exclusively in the chromosome, and restriction patterns indicated that they were part of a transposon, Tn554, characteristic of the classical S. aureus ermA strain. Unlike S. aureus ermA strains examined previously, which harbor Tn554 at a single specific (primary) site, four of our S. aureus isolates had second inserts at different chromosomal sites. The majority of our coagulase-negative isolates had two or more inserts, neither of which occurred at the classical primary site and many of which differed from one another in location (as inferred from restriction patterns). Coagulase-negative staphylococci constitute a large reservoir of the ermA and ermC class of determinants, with clear potential for interspecies spread.\r"

In all instances, MICs were less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml. The majority of tests showed MBCs of greater than 32 micrograms/ml, although there was some effect from varying the inoculum and the length of incubation after subculturing. Minor differences were noted when tests were repeated and between the results from microdilution and macrodilution tests and those obtained by the time-kill method. These results, as well as other reports, suggest that TMP-SMX should not be considered a reliable bactericidal agent against enterococci.\r"

We have modified the system to consistently deliver maximally oxygenated dBCS to the heart. Laboratory studies indicated that bubbling O2 through a 16-gauge intravenous catheter in a central Luer-Lok port of the cardiotomy reservoir provided contents of dissolved O2 that were consistently near maximal. We then studied 17 patients in the operating room. The first 6 patients received dBCS oxygenated with 100% O2 with a high dissolved O2 content of 3.2 +/- 0.2 ml/dl. However, the pH of the dBCS became highly alkaline (7.83 +/- 0.11 at 37 degrees C). Therefore, in the remaining 11 patients, 2% CO2 was added to the O2. The dissolved O2 content remained high (3.3 +/- 0.1 ml/dl), and the pH was in a more physiological range (7.35 +/- 0.09 at 37 degrees C). We conclude that consistently maximal oxygenation of a dBCS at a more physiological pH can be achieved by this method.\r"

Medical employees had nearly a fivefold increased incidence of hepatitis B and a twofold increased incidence of hepatitis non-B.

In this midwestern community, the incidence of acute viral hepatitis is substantial, with medical employees at significantly increased risk.\r"

Although patient preference was the most important factor for most respondents, we observed three different patterns of decision strategies. Those in the first group, the autonomists (34% of respondents), considered only patient preference; those in the second group, the mixed strategists (56% of respondents), included patient preference among other important factors; and those in the third group, the paternalists (10% of respondents), used factors other than patient preference. More experienced clinicians and those individuals who believed tube feeding represented an extraordinary level of care were significantly less likely to begin tube feeding in the case simulations. Description of these individual decision strategies and elucidation of the important physician characteristics can help identify the potential ethical dilemmas in these different clinical decisions.\r"

Total hyphemas treated with tPA showed 80% clearance within 24 hours, while eyes treated with PS and untreated eyes cleared in 14 days. Measurement of corneal thickness revealed the tPA-treated eyes to have less corneal edema than eyes treated with PS and untreated eyes. There was no difference in intraocular pressure.

The antiphospholipid antibody results were analyzed using 2 methods: the frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies was 9% by lupus anticoagulant using the Russell viper venom time (95% confidence interval 22-2.5) and 11% by anticardiolipin antibody assay (95% confidence interval 25-3.7), which was not significantly different from that in control subjects. However, the mean levels in the aborters (although within the normal range) were significantly higher than those in control subjects for anti-double-stranded DNA (P = 0.004), lupus anticoagulant (by Russell viper venom time; P = 0.05), and anticardiolipin antibody (P = 0.0007), when examined by multiple linear regression analysis corrected for age and concurrent pregnancy. Of the 3 patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and subsequent successful pregnancies, only 1 was treated with prednisone and aspirin.

Computer analysis was then used to calculate 70 different articular indices for each patient.

The results show that: findings in a restricted set of examined joints were equivalent to those in a more complete set; the simultaneous presence of joint tenderness and swelling yielded higher correlation than did either variable alone; and joint \"weighting\" for size yielded higher correlation than did simple counts.\r"

  ".W": "An understanding of the immunologic relationships between collagenases of various cellular origins is necessary to define the roles of various cell types in the pathologic tissue destruction seen in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. We compared the immunologic cross-reactivity of human neutrophil and skin fibroblast collagenases, utilizing polyclonal antisera prepared to purified enzymes. Polyclonal antisera from rabbits immunized with neutrophil collagenase recognized fibroblast collagenase, as well as the neutrophil enzyme, when analyzed by immunoblot techniques. The cross-reactive epitopes constituted a major proportion of the antibody population, as shown by competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; 50% of the antibody to neutrophil collagenase was inhibited by skin collagenase. Paradoxically, antisera to fibroblast collagenase failed to recognize the neutrophil enzyme, either by immunoblot techniques or competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, an observation which supports the notion that there are unique immunodominant epitopes. The cross-reactivity with skin fibroblast collagenase shown by the neutrophil antibody suggests a conservation of epitopes between collagenases of different cellular origins. The presence of epitopes unique for each enzyme, however, could lead to a feasible approach for investigating the differential contribution of various cell types to collagenolytic activity in inflamed tissues.\r"

We therefore speculated that the drug may reach the inner ear and act directly on the sensory cell-afferent nerve synapse. Mice, injected with tritiated astemizole and killed 17 hours later, showed the presence of the drug in the vestibular tissues. Nerve recordings were made from the isolated posterior semicircular canal of the frog. Both spontaneous and stimulated firing rates were obtained with artificial perilymph containing astemizole bathing the isolated canal preparation. Results showed that astemizole has a significant inhibitory effect on vestibular nerve activity at concentrations of 10(-7) mol/L and higher. The exact site of astemizole's inhibitory action is undetermined but is most likely at the hair cell-afferent nerve synapse.\r"

They were then mated with untreated females of the Basc marker strain. A brooding pattern was used to assess mutagenicity at different germ cell stages. The rate of lethal mutations was assessed in the F2 generation. Halothane produced a dose-dependent increase in the rate of lethal mutations, but the mutagenicity was independent of the presence of nitrous oxide and of the stage of germ cell formation. Neither enflurane nor isoflurane was mutagenic in the presence of nitrous oxide.\r"

  ".W": "Although an increase in protein phosphorylation on tyrosine was first noted as a result of cell transformation or the application of growth factors to cells, recent reports have shown high levels of tyrosine kinases in nondividing tissues. For that reason, we have investigated whether normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) contain tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activity. Using a copolymer of glutamine: tyrosine as a substrate for the phosphotransferase reaction, we have demonstrated that PMN contain a cytosolic tyrosine kinase activity that elutes as a single peak from Sephacryl S-200 chromatography and has a molecular weight of 70 kilodaltons. Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60), contain a similar activity (as demonstrated by column chromatography), with only 25% of the activity found in PMN. This cytosolic tyrosine kinase can phosphorylate angiotensin II and a fragment of the src protein containing tyrosine 416, which suggests a similar substrate specificity to other tyrosine-phosphorylating protein kinases. In addition, we have demonstrated that PMN have double the amount of phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity of that found in HL-60 cells. This enzyme has a Km of 0.932 mmol/L and a Vmax of 0.355 mumol inorganic phosphate released/mg protein/min, which is similar to other cellular PTPase. Activation of PMN with f-Met-Leu-Phe and phorbol esters causes a slight but statistically significant drop in PMN PTPase activity. These results suggest that terminally differentiated myeloid cells have high tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activity, which may play a role in stimulus response coupling in the mature PMN.\r"

  ".W": "By using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the presence of the soluble form of the interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was evaluated in the peripheral blood of 54 patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Serum levels of sIL-2R were correlated with clinical features, relevant hematologic and immunological data, and in some cases, with in vitro functional studies. In 51 patients (94.4%), the levels of sIL-2R were increased as compared with normal age-matched controls (1,781 U/mL +/- 231 v 276 U/mL +/- 26, respectively; P less than .001). Although this increase was observed in all stages of the disease and independently of several hematologic and immunologic parameters, a trend toward lower levels of sIL-2R was documented in patients with a less-invasive disease. When the values were correlated with the functional status of the residual T cell population, it was found that patients with the lowest levels of sIL-2R showed the best mitogenic response and helper capacity. It is suggested that in B-CLL patients the high levels of serum sIL-2R, capable of binding to its ligand, may block the T cell-produced IL-2, thus contributing toward a defective physiological action by this lymphokine. In turn, this defective availability of IL-2 may play a part in the abnormal immunoregulation that is implicated in the hypogammaglobulinemia, susceptibility to infections, and incidence of second neoplasias often observed in this disease.\r"

Femoral bone marrow of 3-month-old rabbits was defatted with organic solvents. Glycosaminoglycans were prepared from the defatted tissue after its digestion with pronase, treatment with mild alkali, and then digestion with DNase-I. The tissue contained glycosaminoglycans equivalent to 195 mg of hexosamine per femur, which accounted for 27.3% of the total hexosamine in the tissue. Studies with hyaluronidase from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus and chondroitinase ABC showed that the glycosaminoglycans were composed of hyaluronic acid (16% of the total glycosaminoglycan) and chondroitin 6-sulfate (79%). The chondroitin 6-sulfate was separated on Bio-Gel A-0.5m gel into two molecular species with mol wt of greater than 12,000 (Kd greater than 0.2) and approximately 8,000 (Kd = 0.47). Bone marrow digested with chondroitinase ABC and then treated with three monoclonal antibodies 4/8/9-A-2, 5/6/3-B-3, and 5/6/1-B-5, which were specific for unsaturated 4-sulfated, 6-sulfated, and nonsulfated disaccharide structures, respectively, at the nonreducing end of chondroitin sulfate chains, reacted with only 5/6/3-B-3. This result indicated that the chondroitin sulfate, isomer in the bone marrow is chondroitin 6-sulfate, consistent with the biochemical results. The chondroitin 6-sulfate was localized mainly in the extracellular compartment and was considered to be involved in construction of the hemopoietic microenvironment in the bone marrow.\r"

The restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) investigated were the intragenic polymorphic Bc/I site within the factor VIII gene; the extragenic multiallelic Taq I system at the St14 locus; and the extragenic Bg/II site at the DX13 locus. The factor VIII probe was informative in 30%, St14 in 82%, and DX13 in 60% of obligate carriers. The combination of factor VIII-Bc/I and St14-Taq I showed that 91% of obligate carriers were heterozygotes for one or both; with all three probes, only 4% of obligate carriers were noninformative. In families clearly segregating for hemophilia A, RFLP analysis allowed us to define the carrier status for the hemophilia A gene in all 27 women tested. RFLP analysis allowed us to exclude the carrier status in 39 of 45 female relatives of sporadic patients. The combination of RFLP analysis and biological assay of factor VIII allowed us to identify a de novo mutation in the maternal grandfather in 7 of 12 of the families with sporadic cases, for which members of three generations were available for study. Nine of 10 couples requesting prenatal diagnosis provided informative RFLP DNA pattern. Carrier status was excluded in two women, two fetuses were shown to be female, and prenatal diagnosis was carried out in five pregnancies by DNA analysis. Prenatal testing was successful in three instances and failed in two because a sufficient amount of chorionic villous DNA was not obtained for the analysis.\r"

In addition to increased concentrations of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and increased plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis in plasma, these stimuli produce additional cellular-phase activity in blood that is of the same magnitude as the plasma response. To determine whether tPA alone, rather than other consequences of these stimuli, is responsible for the cellular response, the in vitro effects of tPA on whole blood, plasma, and calculated cellular-phase (whole blood minus plasma) activities were determined by solid-phase radiofibrin assay on venous blood from ten normal subjects (seven men, three women). At tPA concentrations encompassing physiological and therapeutic levels (5 to 100 ng/mL; 0.7 to 14 IU/mL), increments in whole blood were consistently in excess of those in companion plasma and represented increased cellular-phase activity equivalent in magnitude to the well-known increase in plasma activity. Fibrinolytic activity produced by 10 to 20 ng tPA/mL (1.4 to 2.8 IU/mL) was consistently detected in whole blood and plasma by 60 minutes, with higher concentrations (100 ng or 14 IU tPA/mL) detectable after a five-minute assay in all subjects. Thus, tPA alone, without invoking fibrinolytic factors extraneous to blood or other effects of exercise or venous occlusion, accounts for both cellular and plasma responses to these stimuli. The considerable cellular response, the mechanism of which remains to be elucidated, may constitute a determinant of individual therapeutic responsiveness to tPA.\r"

Histopathological studies suggest a more generalized thrombotic tendency with platelets and fibrin within the microvasculature. Fibrinogen is elevated in SLE and this may lead to the fibrin deposition described. We wondered if decreased fibrinolysis contributed to this and we infused desamino D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) into ten patients with SLE and eight controls. DDAVP stimulates endothelial production of plasminogen activator (PA) and factor VIII. Baseline results showed a significant decrease in PA activity with a concomitant increase in fibrinogen in SLE. The t-PA and inhibitor levels were normal but factor VIII was increased. After infusion of DDAVP, results indicated that, despite baseline results, SLE patients were able to respond to stimulation and the increase in PA activity produced a decrease in plasma fibrinogen levels. These findings may have therapeutic implications.\r"

During the 72 (range 32-91) month period of antihypertensive treatment the average arterial blood pressure fell from 143/96 mm Hg to 129/84 mm Hg and albuminuria decreased from 1038 micrograms/min to 504 micrograms/min. The rate of decline in the glomerular filtration rate decreased from 0.89 (range 0.44-1.46) ml/min/month before treatment to 0.22 (range 0.01-0.40) ml/min/month during treatment. The rate of decline in the glomerular filtration rate was significantly smaller during the second three years compared with the first three years in patients who received long term antihypertensive treatment (greater than or equal to 6 years). One patient died from acute myocardial infarction (glomerular filtration rate 46 ml/min/1.74 m2). Effective antihypertensive treatment postpones renal insufficiency in diabetic nephropathy.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of a long term reduction in blood pressure on the kidney function of normotensive diabetic patients who had persistent microalbuminuria (30-300 mg albumin/24 hours) were studied in two groups of 10 such patients before and during six months of treatment with either 20 mg enalapril or placebo daily. Treatments were assigned randomly in a double blind fashion. Before treatment both groups had similar clinical characteristics, weight, diet, total glycosylated haemoglobin, median albumin excretion rate (enalapril group 124 mg/24 h, placebo group 81 mg/24 h), and mean arterial pressure (enalapril group 100 (SD 8) mm Hg, placebo group 99 (6) mm Hg). During treatment weight, urinary urea excretion, and total glycosylated haemoglobin remained unchanged. The mean arterial pressure decreased in the enalapril group but not in the placebo group (enalapril group 90 (10) mm Hg, placebo group 98 (8) mm Hg). The median albumin excretion rate also fell in the enalapril group but not in the placebo group (enalapril group 37 mg/24 h, placebo group 183 mg/24 h.) The glomerular filtration rate rose in the enalapril group from 130 (23) ml/min/1.73 m2 to 141 (24) ml/min/1.73 m2, and total renal resistances and fractional albumin clearance decreased while fractional albumin clearance increased in the placebo group. These results show that in patients who have diabetes but not hypertension a reduction in blood pressure by inhibition of converting enzyme for six months can reduce persistent microalbuminuria, perhaps by decreasing the intraglomerular pressure.\r"

Of these, 26 and 11 respectively had suffered sudden death, for which necropsy was performed. Half of the men who had died suddenly had been registered for alcohol intemperance up to 1973, which was four times the prevalence of such registrations in the general population. Registration at both the Swedish Temperance Board and the Bureau of Social Services was associated with an odds ratio of 3.74 for sudden death as compared with not being registered at either. Logistic analysis including the classical risk factors for ischaemic heart disease together with registration for alcohol intemperance and at the Bureau of Social Services showed only the two types of registration and systolic blood pressure to be independent risk factors. On the other hand, there was no overrepresentation of subjects entered in the registers among those surviving a myocardial infarction. For non-fatal myocardial infarction blood pressure and serum triglyceride concentration were significant risk factors and serum cholesterol concentration, smoking, and body mass index probable risk factors; the two types of registration were not independent risk factors. Alcohol intemperance is strongly associated with an increased risk of sudden death after myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "During 24 hour oesophageal pH monitoring 52 patients who had angina pectoris and normal coronary angiograms underwent exercise testing, as far as their symptoms allowed, on a treadmill to determine whether gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred during exertion. In 11 patients the 24 hour oesophageal pH score was abnormally high; 10 of these showed exertional gastro-oesophageal reflux, and in nine this was associated with their usual chest pain. A further 13 patients had a normal 24 hour pH score but had exertional reflux coincident with chest pain during exercise testing. The mean lower oesophageal sphincter pressure in both of these groups of patients was appreciably lower than that in 28 patients who had a normal 24 hour pH score and no exertional reflux. These findings suggest that exertional gastro-oesophageal reflux accounts for the symptoms of a large proportion of patients who have angina pectoris and normal coronary angiograms and that oesophageal pH monitoring during exercise testing on a treadmill enables this group of patients to be identified.\r"

The number of patients expected to receive each type of dialysis or a transplant is given per million of population. The personnel and facilities required to care for these patients and the costs of each programme were derived using analyses of workloads and costs in the North Western Regional Health Authority. The study has documented the considerable need for \"back up\" beds for patients on dialysis who require temporary care as inpatients. The cost effectiveness of transplantation has been demonstrated; at steady state it is calculated that each successful graft saves the service pounds 30,000. Implementation of the minister's minimum target requires a build up to some three times the resources currently allocated, with parallel increases in numbers of medical, nursing, and other essential staff.\r"

Out of 21 enrolled patients, 14 completed the first year and 13 both years of treatment, which permitted the evaluation of 27 patient years. There were 52 episodes of acute cystitis caused by reinfection: 41 occurred during placebo treatment and only 11 during the methenamine hippurate regimen (p less than 0.01). Extra fluid intake did not reduce the incidence of acute cystitis, nor did it reduce the effect of methenamine hippurate. Methenamine hippurate is an effective prophylactic agent against recurrent acute cystitis and has the advantage of not inducing cross resistance to conventional antibiotics.\r"

Expansion of plasma volume is a central physiological adjustment in normal pregnancy. Conversely, pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia are associated with a reduction in plasma volume and central venous pressure. A study was therefore undertaken to test the hypothesis that plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations are low in pre-eclampsia owing to deficient secretion. Concentrations of the peptide were measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. The mean plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide concentration in healthy pregnant women (n = 22; third trimester) was higher (56 (1 SD 29) ng/l) than in 25 young, non-pregnant controls (37 (19) ng/l). Concentrations in patients suffering from mild pre-eclampsia (n = 9) were higher (127 (60) ng/l) than in normal pregnant women, and in patients with severe pre-eclampsia (n = 6) concentrations were higher still (392 (225) ng/l). Despite failure of plasma volume expansion and low central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures in pre-eclampsia this condition is associated with greatly increased plasma concentrations of plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide, which increase still further with the severity of the disease. These findings are clear evidence that atrial pressure may not be the principal determinant of the release of the natriuretic peptide in pre-eclampsia.\r"

A study was therefore performed in 10,931 people undergoing faecal occult blood screening tests to assess the effect of these drugs on the predictive value of a positive test result. Those with a positive result were interviewed and a full drug history was taken before they underwent a full colorectal examination. Of the 455 people with a positive result, 50 were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: 10 (20%) had colonic neoplasia. Of the 405 who were not taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 129 (32%) had colonic neoplasia. These detection rates were not significantly different, and the predictive value of a positive result for an adenoma larger than 1 cm was 14% in the group not taking anti-inflammatory drugs and 26% in the group taking them (not significant). These results suggest that a finding of occult faecal blood cannot be attributed to upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and should be followed by a thorough colorectal examination.\r"

Among a control group without lung disease the polymorphism was significantly less frequent, being found in only five of 101 apparently healthy blood donors. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymorphism was also present in two of 14 unrelated patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, indicating a lack of association with any specific alpha 1-antitrypsin protein phenotype.

One month after operation, before radiotherapy, there were no significant differences between the two groups in any of the measures of psychosocial morbidity. Knowledge of impending treatment did not seem to influence morbidity. At three months patients who had completed radiotherapy had significantly more somatic symptoms and social dysfunction than those not so treated. At six months the radiotherapy group continued to show more somatic symptoms, but a year after operation there were no significant differences between the groups. Although several patients who received radiotherapy were upset by their treatment, the study failed to confirm that depression and anxiety were commoner among those given radiotherapy than among patients given no further treatment.\r"

Epithelial cancer of the ovary was only 25% as common among those who had ever taken oral contraceptives as those who had never done so (95% confidence interval 8% to 67%). There was little evidence of any important association between use of oral contraceptives and benign teratoma or cystadenoma. Functional cysts of the ovary occurred much less commonly in women who had recently (in the six months preceding diagnosis) taken combined oral contraceptives (but not in those who had taken progestogen only oral contraceptives) than in those who had never taken oral contraceptives or had taken them in the past. This protective effect was more pronounced for corpus luteum cysts (78% reduction; 95% confidence interval 47% to 93%) than for follicular cysts (49% reduction; 95% confidence interval 20% to 70%). It is estimated that about 28 (95% confidence interval 16 to 35) operations for functional ovarian cysts are avoided among every 100,000 women who take oral contraceptives each year.\r"

A significant sex difference was shown, with women predominating. The reaction seemed to be a greater problem with enalapril, and in seven patients it occurred with both captopril and enalapril. Withdrawal of treatment resulted in rapid recovery, and no long term effects were shown. The pathogenesis of the reaction is unknown, but possible mediators include bradykinin and prostaglandins.\r"

The validity of such fears is examined by reviewing the conditions that have given rise to the current American difficulties. It is argued that the rise in malpractice insurance premiums and associated restrictions in availability should be seen against the background of underwriting problems specific to medical liability in conjunction with a general decline in reinsurance cover. The evidence in relation to the clinical and resource implications of malpractice is analysed. In particular, arguments that increased litigation has influenced the practice of \"defensive\" medicine and the choice of specialty are critically examined. Medical malpractice claims and insurance are only part of a professional environment which is undergoing dramatic social and economic changes, many of which seem more plausible candidates to be treated as important influences on the nature and organisation of health care in the United States.\r"

  ".W": "A 62-year-old man with small cell carcinoma (oat cell type) of the lung who had hyponatremia and renal sodium loss with inappropriate antidiuresis is reported. Plasma levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) were not elevated inappropriately. Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), however, were high, and increased after water loading and hypertonic saline infusion. The renin-aldosterone axis was normal, as were adrenal, thyroid, and renal functions. Water restriction to 500 to 700 ml/d resulted in a rise in serum sodium. Analysis of the tumor tissue failed to demonstrate the presence of AVP or ANP. The findings (1) suggest that hyponatremia and renal sodium loss with inappropriate antidiuresis observed in the patient is due to an antidiuretic substance distinct from AVP, and (2) point to the possibility that hypersecretion of ANP may play a role in the pathophysiology.\r"

The tumors were classified histologically as seven cases of follicular lymphomas and 20 cases of diffuse lymphomas. Immunocytologic study on suspended cells and immunohistologic study on frozen tissue sections showed that neoplastic cells in 22 of 27 cases expressed restricted immunoglobulin light chains. In remaining five cases, the neoplastic cells reacted with B-1, Leu-10, and/or Leu-14. These results indicate that thyroid lymphomas are exclusively B-cell-derived tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of total and individual fecal neutral steroids in different groups of intestinal pathology from 105 patients was performed to investigate a relationship between neutral steroid concentration and malignant potentiality of colon cells. The fecal concentration of total neutral steroids was significantly higher in patients with colon cancer (57.3 +/- 2.4 mmol/kg of wet feces) and patients with malignant degenerative polyps at Stage I or II (49.5 +/- 2.9) compared with controls (36.9 +/- 3.5) as well as patients with adenomatous polyps (22.4 +/- 2.0). Moreover, a significant correlation was found between total neutral steroid concentrations and coprostanol concentrations in patients with colon cancer (r = 0.928) and in patients with malignant polyps (r = 0.915). Coprostanol results only from the biohydrogenation of delta 5-3 beta-OH steroids by anerobic bacteria because the analysis of a malignant colon tumor in comparison with a healthy colon wall showed that cholesterol is the only steroid included in membrane cells, and that the incubation of Clostridium or Bacteroides with delta 5-3 beta-OH steroids, such as cholesterol (steroid of animal origin) or beta-sitosterol (steroid of plant origin) converts these steroids into coprostanol at a level of efficiency greater than 45%. The findings suggest that high levels of coprostanol reflecting a high growth of anerobic bacteria through the gut are related to the malignant potentiality of colon cells. The screening of neutral fecal steroids should provide a valuable parameter for predicting the malignancy of colon cells.\r"

Certain prostaglandins, notably PGI2, actually improved survival in shock and ischemic states; however, some, including TxA2, act as mediators, significantly contributing to the pathophysiology of vasospasm and ischemia. This makes the intelligent use of eicosanoid-related drugs very difficult. Broad-based inhibitors (for example, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors) are not likely to exert significant protective effects because they inhibit beneficial as well as detrimental eicosanoids. More appropriately, the therapy of ischemic disorders should be designed to employ specific agents (for example, TxSI and TxRA) rather than broad-based agents. Preliminary studies already suggest the success of such an approach. Future investigations will focus on the application of potent synthetic modulators or analogues of specific eicosanoids in an attempt to prevent the deleterious effects of eicosanoid mediators of ischemic disorders and to potentiate and prolong the beneficial actions of therapeutic eicosanoids.\r"

There was no significant change associated with hypercarbia (PaCO2 = 55.7 +/- 1.5 mmHg, lidocaine = 3.93 +/- 0.18 microgram X ml-1) or hypocarbia (PaCO2 = 19.5 +/- 1.4 mmHg, lidocaine = 4.29 +/- 0.25 microgram X ml-1), despite the known effects of changes in CO2 tension on hepatic blood flow and lidocaine protein binding. During hypercarbia, plasma lidocaine binding decreases while total plasma lidocaine remains essentially constant; therefore, increased CO2 tensions could cause toxicity if total lidocaine concentrations were in the high therapeutic range (5 micrograms X ml-1). Four subjects experienced transient symptoms of mild lidocaine toxicity during acute increases in carbon dioxide tension.\r"

The present study was designed to define further the interaction between atrial natriuretic factor and the renin-angiotensin system by examining the hemodynamic effects of Wy-47,663, a synthetic human atrial natriuretic factor, in conscious normotensive rats, in renin-dependent (aortic-ligated) hypertensive rats, and in rats made hypertensive by chronic infusion of angiotensin II. Changes in renal and mesenteric blood flow were continuously monitored in the rats using pulsed Doppler flow probes chronically implanted in the animals one week prior to testing. Infusion of increasing doses of Wy-47,663 caused dose-dependent reductions in mean arterial pressure in all three groups of rats, but the depressor responses were significantly greater in renal hypertensive and angiotensin II-infused rats. Renal blood flow tended to increase during the infusion of the atrial peptide in the angiotensin II-treated rats, and renal vascular resistance fell significantly (-37 +/- 6%). However, Wy-47,663 significantly reduced renal blood flow in the normotensive and renal hypertensive rats, while renal vascular resistance was increased (29 +/- 6%) and unchanged (3 +/- 9%), respectively. Mesenteric blood flow was reduced significantly, and mesenteric vascular resistance was increased markedly in all three groups of rats during infusion of the atrial peptide. In a separate group of renal hypertensive rats, the hemodynamic effects of complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system were assessed by injection of an angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor (Wy-44,655).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Steady-state blood flow was calculated from arteriolar diameter and red blood cell velocity measurements using video microscopy in the intestinal or skeletal muscle microcirculation. Arterioles demonstrated spontaneous vasomotor tone by dilating to topical adenosine, but topical or intravenous ANF did not cause vasodilation. Either angiotensin, norepinephrine, or vasopressin was added to the suffusates in the presence or absence of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (30 microM, meclofenamate or indomethacin) because each agonist is known to stimulate vasoactive prostanoid synthesis. In the intestine, angiotensin (500 nM) caused 40 +/- 2% blood flow decreases during intravenous saline but only 23 +/- 6% during intravenous ANF. Angiotensin (162 nM) and a cyclooxygenase inhibitor caused 19 +/- 4% blood flow decreases but only 8 +/- 5% decreases with cyclooxygenase inhibitor and topical ANF. In contrast, norepinephrine (2-5 microM) caused vasoconstriction that was not altered by topical or intravenous ANF, either alone or in combination with cyclooxygenase inhibitors. In the spinotrapezius muscle, angiotensin (1-2 nM) plus a cyclooxygenase inhibitor caused 40-60% blood flow decreases but only 20-30% decreases during intravenous or topical ANF. Topical or intravenous ANF did not alter the vasoconstriction evoked by arginine vasopressin (0.5-1.0 nM) or by norepinephrine (40-230 nM).

The lowest doses of atrial natriuretic factor infusion resulted in circulating levels that were previously produced by 0-10% saline volume expansion. At the lowest infusion rate, circulating ANF increased 31 +/- 3 pg/ml, resulting in a significant increase in absolute sodium excretion, fractional excretion of sodium, and fractional excretion of lithium, and a significant decrease in urine osmolality. A greater change in circulating atrial natriuretic factor (96 +/- 12 pg/ml) was required to significantly decrease right atrial pressure, cardiac output, and plasma renin activity, and to increase systemic vascular resistance and total and fractional excretion of potassium. The highest dose of atrial natriuretic factor infused was required to decrease arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance. The present study demonstrates that atrial natriuretic factor is natriuretic and diuretic at physiologic concentrations; at low concentrations, atrial natriuretic factor appears to decrease the whole kidney proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium and does not affect glomerular filtration rate; a greater (but physiologic) change in circulating atrial natriuretic factor is required to significantly decrease cardiac output, cardiac filling pressure, and plasma renin activity than is required to significantly increase sodium excretion; and a decrease in systemic arterial pressure and vascular resistance does not occur at physiologic concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor.\r"

Intrajugular vein, intracarotid artery, and intravesical catheters were installed 3-4 weeks later under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia. Then, when the rats were conscious, blood volume was expanded using blood from donor rats once every 15 minutes in 3 increments of 10% of the calculated total blood volume at a rate of 5 ml/kg/min. Blood and urine samples were collected before volume expansion and at the end of each 15-minute period, with the withdrawn blood being replaced. A maximal fourfold increase in urinary volume, urinary sodium excretion, and plasma atrial natriuretic factor was observed in all but the right-atrial-appendectomized animals. Plasma atrial natriuretic factor, urinary volume, and urinary sodium excretion were correlated in all 4 groups. No significant changes in blood pressure or hematocrit were noted. Plasma vasopressin, measured at the end of volume expansion, was significantly lower in animals subjected to left atrial appendectomy. High-performance liquid chromatography of plasma from the control groups indicated that most of the released ANF during blood volume expansion corresponded to a high molecular weight peptide.

We therefore tested, in rats with catheter-induced sterile aortic vegetations, the duration of administration of antibiotic necessary to prevent endocarditis induced by bacterial inocula 100 to 10,000 times the 90% infective dose of two tolerant viridans-group streptococci and two Streptococcus faecalis strains. Multiple-dose regimens of amoxicillin alone or of amoxicillin combined with gentamicin were studied. Against the two viridans group streptococci, successful prophylaxis was achieved with multiple doses of amoxicillin alone given over 24 to 48 hr and by the combination of amoxicillin and gentamicin given for 6 to 24 hr. Against the two S. faecalis strains, multiple-dose regimens with amoxicillin alone failed, but the combination of amoxicillin and gentamicin was successful when administered for 48 to 72 hr. Thus, after challenge with high bacterial inocula, repeated doses of a beta-lactam antibiotic alone were sufficient to prevent viridans streptococcal endocarditis, but multiple doses of a bactericidal combination (beta-lactam plus aminoglucoside), as necessary for the treatment of established endocarditis, were a prerequisite for successful prophylaxis of S. faecalis endocarditis.\r"

  ".W": "Frequency- and voltage-dependent modification of drug-induced inhibition of maximal upstroke velocity of the action potential (Vmax) by the combined administration of two class I antiarrhythmic drugs was studied in canine Purkinje fibers, taking depression of upstroke velocity as an indicator of sodium channel blockade. The kinetics of onset of drug-induced Vmax depression and the time course of Vmax recovery were studied after exposure to therapeutic concentrations of tocainide (50 microM) and quinidine (5 microM) both singly and in combination. The rate constant for onset of block during a drive train at a cycle length of 600 msec was 0.95 +/- 0.32 pulses in the presence of tocainide and 5.61 +/- 0.50 pulses in the presence of quinidine. The magnitude of block was three times greater with quinidine than with tocainide. The magnitude of block produced by the combination was no greater than that produced by quinidine alone and may be partly due to abbreviation of action potential duration by tocainide. Onset of block in the presence of the combination was best fitted by a double exponential with rate constants of 0.88 +/- 0.19 and 6.47 +/- 1.36 pulses. Vmax recovery after termination of a rapid train of impulses was delayed by both drugs. Poststimulation recovery from either tocainide- or quinidine-induced block was characterized by a single time constant (1.04 +/- 0.49 and 4.81 +/- 0.76 sec, respectively), while that of the combination was characterized by two time constants (0.43 +/- 0.22 and 5.94 +/- 0.56 sec), presumably corresponding to dissociation of each drug from the sodium channel receptor. The mixture of the two drugs produced a large depression of Vmax of early diastolic premature responses without producing much further depression of Vmax than that produced by quinidine alone at longer coupling intervals. The time constant of recovery from tocainide-induced block was greatly dependent upon membrane potential. After steady-state changes in frequency, the combination produced a greater depression of Vmax at rapid heart rates compared with that produced by quinidine alone, but abbreviated action potential duration more at slower heart rates. Addition of tocainide to fibers equilibrated with quinidine shifted the Vmax-membrane potential relationship to more hyperpolarized potentials, resulting in greater depression of Vmax at more depolarized membrane potentials with little or no additional depression of Vmax at more negative membrane potentials. The results provide a rationale for a possible enhanced antiarrhythmic efficacy of a combination of two class I drugs that have different kinetics of interaction with the sodium channel.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism for the prolonged contractile dysfunction observed in myocardium reperfused after reversible regional ischemia (\"stunned\" myocardium) is unclear. Recent studies suggest that myocardial stunning may be mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals, but the precise molecular species involved remain unknown. Thus we explored the role of the highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radical in regional postischemic dysfunction by using dimethylthiourea (DMTU), an effective and highly permeable hydroxyl radical scavenger. Open-chest dogs undergoing a 15 min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 4 hr of reperfusion received either DMTU (0.5 g/kg iv over 45 min starting 30 min before occlusion, n = 14) or saline (n = 15). Control and treated dogs were comparable with respect to variables that may affect postischemic dysfunction, including heart rate, aortic pressure, left atrial pressure, arterial blood gases and hemoglobin concentration, size of the occluded bed (determined by postmortem perfusion), and collateral blood flow (determined by radioactive microspheres). Regional myocardial function was assessed by measuring wall thickening with an epicardial Doppler probe. The two groups exhibited comparable systolic thickening under baseline conditions and similar degrees of dyskinesis during ischemia. After reperfusion, however, wall thickening (expressed as percent of baseline) was considerably greater in treated as compared with control dogs: 53 +/- 9% (mean +/- SEM) vs 9 +/- 14% (p less than .03) at 1 hr, 55 +/- 9% vs 23 +/- 13% (p less than .05) at 2 hr, 60 +/- 9% vs 28 +/- 14% (p less than .05) at 3 hr, and 67 +/- 5% vs 36 +/- 13% (p less than .05) at 4 hr. Thus DMTU produced a significant and sustained improvement in recovery of contractile function. In concentrations greater than the plasma levels attained in vivo, DMTU did not scavenge either hydrogen peroxide or superoxide anion in vitro. These results suggest that the myocardial dysfunction occurring after a brief episode of regional ischemia is mediated in part by the hydroxyl radical.\r"

For isoimmunization the immunologic nature of fetal death (hydrops fetalis) is beyond question, but many of the details are poorly understood. It would be extremely helpful to know what immunologic factors are responsible for the wide variation in the degree of fetal hemolysis. This information would surely lead to improved management of isoimmunized pregnancies and create new and more successful therapies for fetuses at risk for hemolysis. The immunology of autoimmune-associated fetal death is, for the most part, an enigma. For the fetal deaths associated with SLE and the antiphospholipid antibodies, demise appears to be a consequence of uteroplacental vascular damage. But the observable pathology is nonspecific, and the evidence for a direct immunologic mechanism is sparse. The similarity between the uteroplacental vascular lesions found with these autoimmune conditions and those seen in preeclampsia demands more intensive investigation. For the fetal deaths caused by complete congenital heart block associated with maternal autoantibodies, the evidence for a direct immunologic mechanism is now being established. As with isoimmunization, a more complete understanding of autoimmune-associated fetal death will open new avenues of management and therapy.\r"

Low back disability is related to occupational, psychosocial, diagnostic, demographic, anthropometric, health behavior, and injury factors that have been reported in the literature. The multiattribute utility model is a new experimental approach to prediction of disability. The relative weights of the various factors that might be predictive of low back disability are determined by a panel of experts. Although this model is not yet scientifically proven, it offers a promising method of answering the question, \"Can low back disability be predicted?\"\r"

These responses were sustained up to 90 minutes and not accompanied by reflex tachycardia. Cardiac index and stroke volume index increased significantly at 90 minutes and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and mean right atrial pressure remained unchanged. Urine volume, urinary sodium excretion, creatinine clearance, and fractional excretion of sodium increased significantly, but fractional excretion of potassium and phosphate did not change. Elevated plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, and norepinephrine were suppressed after the injection of alpha-hANP. The bolus injection of this peptide has moderately hypotensive, vasorelaxant, and natriuretic effects in patients with congestive heart failure.\r"

Carbon dioxide production, oxygen consumption, ventilation, respiratory exchange ratio and oxygen saturation were also measured during and up to 10 min after exercise. There were no significant differences between the asthmatic and control subjects in levels of carbon dioxide production, oxygen consumption and ventilation. The respiratory exchange ratio was greater in the asthmatic subjects during recovery from exercise (P less than 0.05). No changes in oxygen saturation were observed during exercise in either group. In both asthmatic and control subjects, lactate, pyruvate, hydrogen ion, alanine and glycerol concentrations showed an increase from baseline levels, reaching maximum levels up to 10 min after exercise and returning to baseline within 1 h after exercise. Total ketone body concentrations decreased during exercise. There were no significant differences between the asthmatic and control subjects in the concentration of any metabolite over the study period. These data indicate that fuel metabolism during and after short-term progressive exercise is similar in stable asthmatic and normal subjects.\r"

The effect of this plasma on Na+,K+-ATPase activity, and its transport equivalent 86Rb uptake, was measured in separated guinea pig renal cortical tubules. Plasma from water deplete rats had a raised plasma osmolality and sodium concentration and a significant inhibitory effect on Na+,K+-ATPase (14%) and 86Rb uptake (24%) compared with control or water repleted rats. Inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase and 86Rb transport was not seen with plasma from rats after dietary sodium loading (urine sodium 5.2 +/- 0.9 mmol/day) compared with low sodium diet controls (urine sodium 0.41 +/- 0.08 mmol/day). Des-amino arginine vasopressin in vivo produced no inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase or Rb transport. These studies suggest, that in terms of common homoeostatic insults, circulating inhibitors of Na+,K+-ATPase are more responsive to water depletion than to oral sodium loading. The inhibitors may fulfil a physiological role in increasing sodium excretion to maintain osmolality after dehydration.\r"

In these patients from a single hospital, the APS overestimated and the SAPS underestimated the probability of hospital mortality. The MPM probabilities most closely matched the observed outcomes. Each method holds considerable promise for assessing the severity of illness of critically ill patients. The MPM should be particularly useful for comparing ICU performance, since it is independent of ICU treatment and can be calculated at the time a patient is admitted.\r"

With stable PaCO2 during mechanical ventilation, the correlation coefficient (r) between PaCO2 and PetCO2 was .9, and between PaCO2 and PtcCO2, .87. PtcCO2 considerably overestimated PaCO2 in three patients who were receiving dopamine. After withdrawal of mechanical ventilation, changes in PaCO2 were closely paralleled by changes in PetCO2 and PtcCO2 (r = .82 and .86, respectively). Nine of 20 patients had an increased PaCO2 of 10 torr or greater. In eight of these, PetCO2 and PtcCO2 rose by at least 5 torr, and in seven, the rise in PetCO2 and PtcCO2 was within 5 torr of the rise in PaCO2. During mechanical ventilation, PetCO2 and PtcCO2 estimated stable PaCO2 with sufficient accuracy for clinical use, except in patients with cutaneous vasoconstriction. After withdrawal of mechanical ventilation, changes in PetCO2 and PtcCO2 were predictive of important PaCO2 increases, warranting continued exploration and evaluation as to their use in monitoring patients predisposed to hypercarbia.\r"

Twenty-five percent reacted to 5 TU of tuberculin with reactions of 10 mm or more. There was a progressive, substantial loss of reactivity with advancing age. Reactions to PPD-Battey greater than to PPD-T 5 TU were infrequent, suggesting that atypical mycobacterial infections were uncommon and that positive reactions to PPD-T, 250 TU, were predominantly caused by infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Based on the results of both 5 TU and 250 TU, the prevalence of tuberculous infection exceeded 60 percent. Waning of tuberculin sensitivity appears to be an integral part of the aging process. Testing with nonmycobacterial antigens used in this study shed no further light on the problem of anergy in the elderly, as the number of reactors was smaller than that obtained with PPD-tuberculin.\r"

Eight of them (47 percent) had the alleles HLA-A3 B35 Dwl BfF C4A3,2 (BO), which were shown by family studies of some patients to be inherited as an extended MHC-haplotype with an apparent gene duplication in the C4A locus. The other high-risk phenotype, HLA-B40 with a C4 null allele, was found in eight patients (47 percent). All but three of the 17 patients had at least one of the two high-risk markers, the frequency of these combinations being clearly higher than in the two control groups: patients with RA but with no gold-induced side effects and healthy individuals. Our study shows that use of several MHC markers together results in a strong association between the markers and the disease.\r"

The rate of release of glycoprotein into the culture media from the cells, which were incubated in the medium containing [3H]glucosamine for 24 hr in advance, was determined for the study of mucus secretion. Prostaglandins in the medium were measured by radioimmunoassay. AA (10(-4) M) significantly increased mucus synthesis and secretion by the cultured cells (P less than 0.01). PG (E2 and I2) synthesis by the cultured cells was significantly enhanced by AA (10(-4) M) (P less than 0.05). An addition of indomethacin to the culture medium abolished this effect of AA. These results suggested that gastric mucus production was enhanced by AA in vitro and that this effect may be mediated by endogenous PG production.\r"

  ".W": "Oral feeding of DL-difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO) (2% in water ad libitum) for 14 days has no detectable effect on the small intestine of adult rats. Similar feeding of DFMO to weanling rat pups caused diarrhea in three to four days accompanied by a decrease in food consumption and body weight compared to age-matched controls. Significant decreases in small intestinal mucosal weight, total protein, DNA, enterokinase, leucine amino peptidase, sucrase, and maltase contents were observed in the DFMO-treated group four days after treatment. Extending the treatment to seven days led to a more severe reduction in these parameters. Villous atrophy of the mucosa was demonstrable by light microscopy and morphometric measurements. The mucosa of the DFMO-treated rat pups showed a reduction in total thickness and villous height but no change in crypt depth. A significant reduction in villus-crypt ratio was also seen. Changes in small intestinal mucosal parameters were not due to a decrease in food intake since pair-fed, age-matched rat pups showed no biochemical changes compared to control pups. DFMO-treated weanling rats showed less than 5% of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity when compared to age-matched control animals. The effects observed on the small intestinal mucosa are presumably due to inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase activities by DFMO which prevents the proliferation, regeneration, and maturation of epithelial cells. The relative insensitivity of the adult rat small intestine to DFMO treatment suggests a lesser dependence of its intestinal mucosa to ODC activities.\r"

The main mediator appears to be histamine. Although there are a number of defined predisposing factors, the majority of first reactions appear unpredictably. The mainstay of treatment is the use of epinephrine, volume replacement, and positive pressure ventilation. The follow-up and documentation of details of the reaction and exhaustive efforts to determine the precipitating factor are important aspects of the subsequent safety of the patient. History may be of more value than diagnostic testing. The use of H1 and H2 blockers, with steroids and sympathomimetics, may reduce the risk or magnitude of reactions in patients with a past history of a reaction.\r"
