A mathematical comparison was undertaken to discover the differences in the sensitivity of two configurations of artificial hearts to these resistances. It was found that one design incorporating independently pumping ventricles can be tailored to passively mimic the sensitivity of the natural heart. However, the other design with volumetrically coupled pumping is incapable of exhibiting similar sensitivity through passive means.\r"

  ".W": "Biomer and Mitrathane are thromboresistant polyurethane ureas that are suitable for coating artificial valves. Degeneration of the surface coatings, however, does occur over time, and in experimental animal studies adherent thrombi have been observed as a complication. In this study, morphometric techniques applied to scanning electron microscopy were used to assess whether vascular endothelial cells harvested from jugular veins of fetal lambs could be grown to confluence on these polyurethane surfaces, whether the monolayer would remain intact under conditions of shear stress (104 dynes/cm2), and whether this would result in decreased platelet adherence of sheep platelets relative to nonendothelialized surfaces. The results have shown that both Biomer and Mitrathane could be endothelialized: 88.8 +/- 5.1% of the Biomer surface consisted of intact confluent endothelial cells, as did 95.45 +/- 1.7% of the Mitrathane surface. After 6 hr of shear stress, a significant reduction in this feature was observed (p = 0.02), but both materials still maintained a high percentage of confluent endothelial cells (78.65% for Biomer and 85.58% for Mitrathane). After 48 hr of shear stress, however, the percent confluence was similar to control values, which suggested new cell growth. Endothelialized Biomer compared with Mitrathane had fewer adherent single platelets, or small or large aggregates (p = 0.001, p = 0.01, and p = 0.05, respectively); this feature was not affected by shear stress. Whereas endothelialization of the surface clearly decreased platelet adherence on Mitrathane (p = 0.01), only a trend was seen with Biomer. These studies therefore show that endothelialization of these polyurethane surfaces is feasible.\r"

Volumes of intracellular water, interstitial water, blood, and red cells were calculated from the experimental estimates. No statistically significant changes occurred in the water content of the various body compartments in relation to duration of ECMO.

This insufficient refill might be caused by a transcellular fluid shift from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment. We studied the influence of dialysate sodium concentration and UF rate on the refill rate, blood volume, intracellular (ICV) and extracellular fluid volume (ECV). Three different HD strategies were studied in 15 patients: (A) conventional HD (dialysate sodium 140 mmol/L); (B) HD with a sodium profile (140-148 mmol/L); and (C) HD with a sodium profile and a variable UF rate (high-low UF rate). ICV and ECV were measured by non-invasive conductivity measurements, blood volume was calculated from erythrocyte counts before and after treatment. Blood volume decrease was most pronounced during conventional HD, due to insufficient refilling without a detectable transcellular fluid shift. The sum of the decrease in ICV and EVC was less than during (B) and (C). The insufficient refill led to a higher prevalence of hypotension and cramps. The strategies (B) and (C) led to an significant and comparable transcellular fluid shift to the extracellular compartment. Thus, the use of a sodium profile led to a better intravascular refill and clinical tolerance of HD. Addition of a UF profile did not improve this any further.\r"

A stress relief device, termed a skin button, surrounds these tubes as they exit from the recipient's tissues. The skin button is designed to protect the tissues from damage and provide a secure material-tissue interface. Prevention of superficial and invasive infection is the primary goal of the skin button. Eight calves were studied prospectively to identify gross or microscopic infection with the skin button. All animals who survived more than sixty days (62-136) had both gross and microscopic evidence of infection. All animals surviving less than 60 days (13-43) had no gross evidence of infection but one had subcutaneous microscopic abscess formation. No animal died secondary to a skin button infection. Skin buttons cannot prevent infection but they can contain the pathologic process in the superficial tissues with no evidence of systemic effects.\r"

The amount of albumin loss was evaluated in seven patients with familial hypercholesterolemia during LDL apheresis in which columns packed with dextran sulfate-cellulose beads were used as a selective adsorbent of LDL. Serum albumin level significantly decreased from 4.3 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- SD) g/dl to 3.6 +/- 0.2 g/dl. The albumin loss was assessed by two different methods: 1) radioimmunoassay of microalbumin content in the discarded fluid, and 2) measurement of changes in plasma albumin reserve. The albumin losses during one apheresis session were 3.7 +/- 2.9 g and 8.3 +/- 5.7 g, respectively, depending upon which of two different methods was used. There was a significant correlation between these two methods (r = 0.84, p less than 0.02). The amount of albumin loss during apheresis was estimated to be between 4.1% and 9.1% of total plasma albumin reserve, and more than half of the decreased serum albumin level appeared to be attributable to dilution due to the electrolyte solution used for priming of the extracorporeal circuit.\r"

The addition of albumin to the peritoneal cavity did not alter absorption of sulfamethoxazole. The total protein removed in dialysate effluent in the absence of albumin was 1,653 +/- 906 mg. The protein losses when albumin was added to dialysate [( albumin + control losses] - losses in dialysate drainage) were 1,037 +/- 2,305 mg and 1,364 +/- 1,653 mg for the 6 and 12 g studies.\r"

Arteriographic deterioration was found in six of 61 patients (9.8%) and in three this precluded angioplasty.

Hypoalbuminaemia is thought to be the cause since there is a strong association between bowel wall thickening and low serum albumin. To determine the role of portal hypertension in producing gallbladder wall thickening we studied 40 consecutive stable patients-37 with cirrhosis and three with portal hypertension due to primary biliary cirrhosis. Ultrasound assessment of the gallbladder wall was made after an overnight fast using a Technicare autosector. Wall thickness 4 mm or greater was considered abnormal. Twenty-seven patients had a thickened gallbladder wall and all had evidence of portal hypertension. Hypoalbuminaemia was not an important factor since it was only present in six cases with thickened walls. In two cases reduction in portal pressure with oral propranolol was associated with a decrease in gallbladder wall thickness. These results suggest that portal hypertension, not hypoalbuminaemia, is the dominant factor causing gallbladder wall thickening in cirrhosis. Ultrasound demonstration of gallbladder wall thickening in chronic liver disease should suggest the presence of portal hypertension.\r"

A prospective study was conducted on the value of computed tomography (CT) in 63 patients with 73 calcaneal fractures sustained more than 6 months before. The fractures were classified from the initial plain radiographs, and the patients' current clinical condition assessed in terms of a \"disability score\". The mean disability scores (MDS) associated with the different types of fracture were correlated with the CT findings. The highest MDS was found in the intra-articular fracture group which comprised 71% of the series. In this group the MDS was increased in the presence of post-traumatic osteoarthrosis of the subtalar joint (61% of cases), involvement of the calcaneocuboid joint (39% of cases) and subluxation/dislocation of the peroneal tendons (47% of cases). Structural abnormalities of the peroneal tendons were associated with a higher MDS including chronic tenosynovitis (eight cases), chronic partial tendon rupture (eight cases), complete peroneus brevis tendon rupture (two cases) and scarring indicating stenosing tenosynovitis (14 cases). A similar spectrum of appearances affecting the medial tendons of the hindfoot was identified in eight cases. Direct CT measurements of the degree of comminution did not correlate well with the patients' MDS. In the patient with persistent symptoms, CT is of value in the later assessment of long-term complications by revealing abnormalities of the subtalar joints and adjacent tendons.\r"

Four radiologists, of varying experience, independently reviewed the radiographs on a conventional lightbox and later with the digitizer. In the scaphoid series (350 cases), the performance of the two more experienced radiologists was marginally better with the digitizer, whereas the less experienced radiologists performed slightly worse. Overall the digitizer improved the confidence of the radiologists in diagnosing correctly the presence of a scaphoid fracture but, for the less experienced radiologists, this was at the expense of identifying normality. In the wrist series (200 cases), the use of the digitizer resulted in a minor increase in the true positive and decrease in the false negative observations, but this was offset by a concomitant minor increase in the false positive and decrease in the true negative categories. Evaluation of the soft-tissue planes around the wrist joint showed a limited value in the identification of a scaphoid fracture with an overall positive predictive value of 0.26. Correlation of soft-tissue changes and the presence or absence of a scaphoid fracture was slightly worse with the digitizer. Possible causes for the apparently poorer performance of the digitizer are discussed, as well as the relative merits and potential value of the unit.\r"

Large differences in the degree of pathological signal intensity between individual muscles were found in all categories. In the muscular dystrophy and polymyositis patients, the overall involvement was significantly more severe than in patients with congenital myopathy. Definite patterns of selective involvement were seen. Statistical evidence of selective muscle sparing was found; the gracilis muscle was significantly less affected than the other muscles in all three disease groups. Other muscles with significant sparing include the rectus femoris and sartorius muscles of the thigh and the tibialis posterior muscle of the leg. Common anatomical and functional characteristics of muscles may be related to the distribution of muscular disease.\r"

In skin, no evidence of compensatory proliferation was seen if a gap was inserted, whatever its position in the schedule. In oesophagus, a small but significant increase in radioresistance was observed if the gap was positioned 1/4 of the way through treatment compared with the schedule delivered without an interruption (12F/12 days). Although an increase in normal tissue tolerance is not observed by increasing the overall time from 12 to 15 days, provided tumour clonogen proliferation does not occur during the weekend split, the insertion of a gap makes continuous accelerated clinical regimes, currently given without an interruption at weekends, easier to introduce into wider clinical practice.\r"

Several Gn-RH agonists are available for clinical use, and all act through the same mechanism: first to stimulate and then to inhibit gonadotropin and gonadal steroid secretion by downregulating the pituitary Gn-RN receptors. This review should provide clinicians with a working knowledge of the physiologic and pharmacokinetic features of Gn-RH agonists. Although over 2000 articles concerning Gn-RH analogues have been published I chose to review only those that were the first to report a novel clinical application. Gn-RH agonists have proved to be extremely efficacious in treating gonadal steroid-dependent problems such as endometriosis, uterine leiomyoma, precocious puberty and prostate and breast cancers, and they have resulted in very few side effects. Long-term use may, however, lead to skeletal calcium loss in women as a consequence of hypoestrogenism. Further research is needed to prevent this and maintain clinical efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost of screening all Canadians aged 30 years or more without coronary heart disease (CHD) for hypercholesterolemia. DATA SOURCES: The expected results of initial screening of the serum cholesterol level were estimated on the basis of 1986 Canadian census data and the 1978 Canada Health Survey. The results of repeat testing were estimated on the basis of data from the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study. Lipid profile results were extrapolated from tests at the Montreal General Hospital's clinical chemistry laboratory. Laboratory costs and primary care practitioner costs were provided by the Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists and provincial fee schedules respectively. MAIN RESULTS: Among 12,479,356 Canadians free of CHD 48.7% would be identified as being at high risk, 4.8% would be identified as being at moderate risk, and 46.6% would be reassured that their lipid risk for CHD was low. The total cost of implementing the program in the first year would be $432 million to $561 million ($325 million for laboratory tests and $107 million to $236 million for visits to primary care practitioners). CONCLUSION: The substantial cost of implementing a nationwide screening program must be weighed against the expected benefits to ensure that the final result is both practical and economically feasible.\r"

SETTING: A nursing home, a home for the aged and psychogeriatric wards in a provincial psychiatric hospital. PATIENTS: Only subjects 65 years of age or older were eligible for inclusion. A random sample was selected comprising 25% of the residents in the nursing home and the home for the aged; of the 119 asked to participate 95 agreed (44 in the nursing home and 51 in the home for the aged). All 50 on the psychogeriatric wards agreed to participate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Kingston Dementia Rating Scale (KDRS). RESULTS: An MMSE score of less than 24 (cognitive impairment) was given to 37 (84%) of the residents in the nursing home, 43 (84%) of those in the home for the aged and 48 (96%) of the patients in the psychiatric hospital; the corresponding numbers for a KDRS score of more than 0 (cognitive impairment) were 41 (93%), 48 (94%) and 50 (100%). The seven patients receiving the highest level of care at the home for the aged (special care) had more behavioural problems than those in the psychiatric hospital did (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive and behavioural impairment was widespread in the three institutions regardless of the level of care. When planning services and allocating resources government funding agencies should consider the degree and prevalence of such impairment among elderly people in institutions.\r"

  ".U": "91098588\r", 
  ".W": "Research in the psychosocial and behavioral aspects of cancer has shown steady growth since the 1950s, and its course of development has paralleled the history of medical techniques in treating cancer. Table 1 outlines this parallel evolution from the 1850s to the 1960s. The roles of the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in spearheading and nurturing research in this area are documented. Interest in psychooncologic questions can be traced back for centuries to the search for etiologic factors and psychologic variables that would explain individual vulnerability to cancer. The first psychologic studies of cancer patients were reported in 1951 and 1952 from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, respectively. The 1970s saw new interest in psychosocial and behavioral research with many issues being addressed for the first time: better care of the terminally ill through more humanistic approaches including better means of pain control; ethical concerns related to patient rights and their status as subjects in experimental protocols; trying to measure quality of life for cancer patients on protocols; seeing the need for multidisciplinary collaborative groups to make up for the absence of formal training in this area; and the need to design valid, accurate measuring scales specific to the symptomology of patients with cancer. Table 4 outlines how the 1980s gave increasing recognition and support to the psychosocial dimensions of cancer. This period produced a series of key conferences that examined a broad research and education perspective and produced recommendations that remain a benchmark in regard to instrumentation, conceptual models, pitfalls of psychosocial research, training, and education, and the organization of research efforts. New precision has been added to the field in the past 6 years: studies measuring concurrent psychologic, endocrine, and immune function; use of statistical modeling to incorporate quality of life data as a correction factor in survival data (TWiST and QALY); and broadened definitions of medical outcome to include functional status, thus allowing advances in psychiatric measurements to help answer questions in cancer. The challenges for the 1990s are identified in a summary in Table 9. Especially noteworthy is the observation that the comprehensive research needed today cannot be carried out by any one discipline alone. New approaches call for areas of the social sciences formerly inactive in cancer research (e.g., anthropology) to contribute the tools and expertise required to address the problems.\r"

  ".W": "Typical inferential statistical procedures, such as the t-test and analysis of variance, compare differences in mean values of variables. This approach can sometimes obscure rather than illuminate research data. Here we present and discuss alternative data analytic techniques. Potential advantages of box plots over conventional t-tests for understanding data are shown by comparing the area under high and low frequencies from spectral curves of autonomic changes following chemotherapy treatment. Typical t-tests provide information regarding statistical significance in terms of the differences in group means; box plots and related exploratory techniques provide information regarding the characteristics of the distributions within the groups as well as examination of potential outliers. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and other multivariate techniques are commonly used to deal with potentially complex data sets with multiple outcome measures. The potential advantages of visual clustering techniques such as star plots, Chernoff faces, and Andrew's Function Plots are demonstrated by examining changes in facial pallor caused by chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Typical MANOVA approaches can identify potential differences in mean values between groups; visual clustering approaches do this by graphically presenting complex interrelationships for individual cases. This approach enhances the visual interpretation of potential interactions that would be obscured by simply focusing on overall mean values. Preliminary data from a meta-analysis on the effect of metoclopramide on chemotherapy-induced vomiting demonstrates the potential uses and advantages of this summary technique over simple tabular summaries. We found significant relationships between the effect size of the drug and variables such as the year of study publication and whether the publication was an article or an abstract. While none of these techniques are meant to replace traditional inferential statistics, they offer advantages in terms of data exploration and understanding relationships within data sets that are not clearly addressed by other methods. They are potentially valuable alternatives worthy of exploration. Finally, we discuss issues of interim analyses and multiple endpoint assessment for clinical trials.\r"

Nonetheless, critical shortcomings continue to characterize the attempt empirically to establish such things as the extent to which social support predicts adjustment to cancer diagnosis and treatment. Prominent among these is the failure to adequately address large elements of the social structure, such as social class and urbanization, and to investigate how they shape the well being of persons with or at risk for cancer and their caregivers. We recommend that more psychosocial research on the link between social support and cancer be conducted within populations beset by poverty and without adequate access to health care. Funding is needed for the training and maintenance of multidisciplinary and multicultural teams of researchers working within community-based organizations and hospitals serving the underserved.\r"

A review is given of the various conceptualizations of the social support/stress paradigm and of the state of the art of measuring social support. Then the current work in the field of social support and cancer is considered and an argument is made for the use of social support measures, which are relevant to the experiences of the cancer patient. Potential adaptations of an existing instrument (the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Scale) are demonstrated, and a taxonomy of stages of cancer that would require additional types of social support measures and interventions is outlined. Interventions are discussed in terms of the traditional support groups as well as interventions by the oncologist and primary care physician. An argument is made for the inclusion of quality of life or functional measures as outcomes in clinical trials and the care of the cancer patient. Finally, the need to address the existential, philosophic, or religious issues surrounding cancer and its treatment is discussed.\r"

This report recommends priorities for the next decade of psychosocial research on cancer prevention and detection. The leading priority for future research is to fill gaps in basic knowledge left by the rush to intervention and outcome studies. Such research must be theoretically driven and should aim to develop broad principles applicable to diverse health behaviors. Studies that include relevant process data on various stages of behavior change are considered more desirable than simple outcome studies. Epidemiologic investigations should be expanded to include measures of relevant behaviors, so that their impact on clinical outcomes might be established. More research is needed on lay perception of health risks and on individual and health-system barriers to effective cancer prevention and detection. Studies that address the needs of minority and underprivileged populations are crucial. Funding agencies' narrow categorical mandates impede interdisciplinary research on multiple risk factors and their interactions; these boundaries must be relaxed to promote such approaches. Funding agencies should also consider basic research as a long-term investment towards the development of effective interventions.\r"

People were expected to shift dramatically from smokers to nonsmokers or from unhealthy to healthy lifestyles. A stage model of change has greater potential to assess the dynamics of change with some people progressing linearly from contemplation to maintenance, others relapsing back to contemplation, and others remaining in a stage like contemplation for long periods. Stage measures provide differential predictions for the amount of progress people in different stages will make after treatment. Assessing processes of change that people apply to progress from one stage to the next can also help to explain the dynamics of behavior change.\r"

An integration of population-based approaches with the dynamics of patient behavior and risks for cancer is especially salient when considering the role of psychosocial stress and personal and social resources. The social epidemiologic perspective, the study of the psychosocial determinants of physical health status, offers one approach for resolving the outlined differences in perspectives and is particularly relevant for understanding the etiology of life-style behaviors and how they might be altered.\r"

There is general agreement that quality of life is a subjective and multidimensional construct, yet comprehensive theoretical models have not been developed and applied fully. We recommend that future research be based on conceptual models that explicate the interrelationships among quality of life domains throughout the stages of cancer care. These models, and the longitudinal research that follows from them, should attend specifically to cross-class and cross-cultural issues to avoid overgeneralization from theory and research that are based largely on the views of the majority culture. We encourage the inclusion of this theory-based quality of life assessment as a standard component of clinical trials. Success in this endeavor will require additional standardization of quality of life measures for use across a range of cancer patient populations, including the development of age-specific norms and instruments designed to assess the entire family system.\r"

  ".W": "Although quality of life assessments have been employed successfully in descriptive and evaluative studies in oncology, their use in cancer clinical trials has, to date, been limited. A range of issues have impeded the conduct of clinical trial-based quality of life investigations. These include: the absence of theoretical models to guide the development of quality of life measures; over-reliance on ad hoc approaches to quality of life assessment; and insufficient attention to the practical constraints operating in clinical research settings. Of primary importance is the need to develop multidimensional quality of life instruments that are brief and psychometrically robust. It is suggested that future work on instrument development focus on refining currently available generic or cancer-specific measures, and on developing new diagnostic-specific questionnaire modules. This psychometric work should be guided by appropriate theoretical models of the relationship among health-related quality of life domains. Although it is widely accepted that the patient represents the most appropriate source of quality of life data, it is suggested that efforts also be directed toward improving the validity and reliability of physician-generated assessments of patients' performance status and of treatment toxicities, and toward determining the feasibility of employing family members as proxy raters of the psychologic and social health status of patients who are unwilling or unable to provide such information. Additional attention should be paid to the many logistical problems that arise in clinical trial-based quality of life investigations. In particular, research designs and data collection procedures should be selected that minimize patient, medical staff, and institutional burden.\r"

This paper provides a commentary on these techniques with an emphasis on the problems inherent in implementing Q-TWiST, a measure that attempts to incorporate patient value preferences into TWiST. It is argued that while Q-TWiST is intuitively appealing in the clinical setting, there are formidable design and psychometric hurdles that must be overcome to fully operationalize the concept.\r"

Regular renal biopsies for histological and immunofluorescence studies were simultaneously obtained, and available for comparative analysis (not controls). Differential counts of mononuclear infiltration and subtyping of T-cell infiltration into T-helper (T-h) and T-suppressor-cytotoxic (T-s-c) cells, as detected by immunoperoxidase stains from FNAB, were correlated to clinical manifestations and renal function tests. Generally, our results indicated increased mononuclear cell infiltration (monocytes, lymphocytes, and/or activated lymphocytes) in FNAB of patients with IgA nephropathy, interstitial nephritis or focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis (especially monocytes in IgA nephropathy and interstitial nephritis, p less than 0.05 compared with controls, lymphocytes in focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis, and non-classifiable glomerulonephritis, p less than 0.02 and 0.05, respectively). The number of infiltrating activated lymphocytes was significantly increased in focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis and focal glomerulosclerosis, p less than 0.05, less than 0.01 and less than 0.01, respectively. FNAB was at least as sensitive as histological examination for the quantification of interstitial cellular infiltration, and it allowed for cytological differential counts. Patients had decreased T-h and increased T-s-c cell counts, which were accentuated in FNAB compared with peripheral blood, although there were strong positive correlations between local and peripheral counts (p less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A 62-year-old man with pneumonia and left flank pain had a clinical syndrome of hyponatremia, hypotension, dehydration, and high urinary sodium excretion in the presence of a normal glomerular filtration rate. The plasma level of antidiuretic hormone was relatively high despite decreased serum osmolality. Thyroid function and excretion of glucocorticoid and sex steroids were normal. The serum aldosterone level was very low despite elevated plasma renin activity. Angiotensin II failed to stimulate any secretion of aldosterone, despite the occurrence of a progressive rise in blood pressure. On the other hand, rapid ACTH administration increased both serum aldosterone and cortisol. The patient showed no effective response to increased salt intake, but large doses of mineralocorticoid resulted in a normal serum sodium level without dehydration. Subsequently, he suffered cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular tachycardia. Postmortem examination showed well differentiated adenocarcinoma in the left pleura and an intact, histologically normal adrenal zona glomerulosa and kidney. This is the first reported case of a critically ill patient with hyponatremia caused by hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism possibly due to angiotensin II insensitivity and tubular unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoid.\r"

Tests were performed twice before EPO treatment and twice when hemoglobin had stabilized in the targeted range. Samples were frozen and batch analyzed for each patient after completion of the study. During this period, dialysis regimens were fixed. EPO treatment caused several significant changes. Hematocrit increased from 21.5% to 34.3%. Pre- and postdialysis serum potassium increased 0.3-0.4 mmol/l, and 56% more potassium binder was given. Serum phosphate concentrations were unchanged, but the aluminum hydroxide dose had been raised 44%. Dialyzer clearance decreased for urea (4.8%), creatinine (14.7%), phosphate (16.5%) and potassium (8.6%). The ratio of postdialysis/predialysis measurements changed for calcium, creatinine and uric acid. Five patients experienced enhanced appetite, but average dry weight did not change, nor could changes be demonstrated for protein catabolism, generation rate of urea and creatinine, or their distribution volumes. Estimated sodium intake remained unchanged. The findings indicate that EPO treatment reduces dialysis efficiency slightly for a number of substances, but in the metabolically stable patient there are no impressive dietary changes. Problems can be overcome by appropriate changes of dialysis regimen and medication.\r"

  ".U": "91098853\r", 
  ".W": "Despite the numerous risk factors for the development of breast cancer that have been investigated, only a few demonstrate a clear association with breast cancer development. Female gender and increasing age are the most important factors, followed by factors involving a woman's menstrual, reproductive, and family history. The risks related to menstruation and reproduction are probably related to the duration of estrogenic breast stimulation. The relationship of family history and breast cancer risk is unclear, but there may be a true genetic basis. The previous occurrence of breast cancer (invasive or in situ), the presence of proliferative pathological changes, especially with atypia, and the presence of other malignancies (e.g., primary ovarian and endometrial cancer) are histological risk factors for the development of new or recurrent breast cancer. Radiation exposure, the use of exogenous estrogens (both estrogen replacement therapy and oral contraceptives), diet (especially fat consumption), and alcohol intake may all play a role in cancer risk. Certain medications as well as patient demographics may also have a weak association. Cigarette smoking, caffeine consumption, and stress presently have little support for an association with breast cancer risk. It should be noted that in only one in four patients can breast cancer be accounted for by the known risk factors. This demonstrates that although presently known risk factors may help in screening for the early detection of breast carcinoma, in its possible prevention by modulation of influenceable factors, and in advising patients about their risks, these factors are merely strong associations with breast cancer incidence and not actual causations. The mechanisms of the development of breast cancer are as yet unknown.\r"

Results of multitrial tests were analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance. SETTING: A pulmonary laboratory in a university hospital. METHODS: We evaluated eight DRs to determine: a) physical characteristics, including the potential for misassembly; b) FIO2 of 1.0 and flow rates of 10 L; c) tidal volume (VT) (male and female operators) using one and two hands; and d) cycling rates at 5 degrees, 20 degrees, and 48 degrees C. RESULTS: All resuscitators met the minimum requirements of the Canadian Standards Association and the American Society for Testing and Materials. However, the CPR and LSP could be assembled incorrectly for use. Three units (B Sav, Pulm, and MPR) delivered significantly less than 80% oxygen (overall p less than .05). Significant increases were seen in VT using two hands vs. one hand (1176 vs. 960 mL, p less than .001) and males vs. females using two hands (1284 vs. 1102 mL, p less than .02). One unit (B Sav) could only be used with two hands. The maximum cycling rates for all units increased significantly (p less than .05) with an increase in temperature from -5 degrees to 20 degrees to 40 degrees C. However, two units (Bag E and MPR) failed to deliver 20 breaths/min at -5 degrees C, while the B Sav and Pulm valves became dysfunctional at 48 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: While these DRs meet the minimum standards, they should be chosen carefully and evaluated before application in the clinical environment.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Pediatric ICU. PATIENTS: Medical patients in a prospective control period (n = 113), an intervention period (n = 226), and a follow-up control period (n = 97). INTERVENTIONS: The survival probabilities of 50% of the patients in the intervention period were displayed at the bedside and the staff viewed a short videotape on the measurement of survival probabilities and costs of pediatric intensive care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Daily survival probabilities and resource use were evaluated each day. Resource use, adjusted for severity of illness, was evaluated using analysis of covariance. Compared with the prospective control group, reductions in the daily use of blood gases (p less than .01), hematology tests (p less than .001), hourly vital signs (p less than .001), and hourly neurologic vital signs (p less than .001) resulting in a composite reduction in daily laboratory and imaging charges from $759 +/- $22 to $622 +/- $18 (p less than .01) were observed in the patient group receiving the survival probabilities and whose physicians also viewed the videotape. Equivalent reductions in resource use also occurred in a simultaneous control group (patients did not receive survival probabilities but healthcare workers did view the videotape) and in a follow-up control group. CONCLUSION: Reduction in pediatric intensive care resource use can occur from the combined effects of actuarial and clinical interventions.\r"

DESIGN: Consecutive sample for descriptions of the clinical features of medical disorders. SETTING: A general medicine group practice in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Sixteen patients with low PAOP (less than 18 mm Hg) on the initial measurement obtained within 12 hr of chest pain onset. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: EVLW was measured by the thermal indocyanine green dye double-indicator dilution method. QRS score was obtained on hospital day 7 from the Selvester's QRS Scoring System. Eleven (69%) patients had increased EVLW greater than 7 mL/kg despite low PAOP. EVLW had no significant correlation with PAOP and the difference between plasma colloid osmotic pressure and PAOP, but did have a significant correlation with pulmonary vascular resistance index (r2 = .31, p less than .05), and QRS score (r2 = .45, p less than .005). CONCLUSIONS: Larger infarcts led to increased EVLW even with low PAOP, and the accumulation of increased EVLW around the small arterioles might have led to increased pulmonary vascular resistance.\r"

The major difference between these circuits was the degree of flow resistance offered by the exhalation valve. DESIGN: Randomized crossover trial. PATIENTS: Twelve infants less than 12 months of age recovering from respiratory failure of variable etiology. Only patients weighing 3 to 10 kg were studied. INTERVENTIONS: The patients were connected to each respiratory circuit in a random sequence, with 15 min allowed for equilibration before assessment of cardiopulmonary function. Airway pressure (Paw) and FIO2 were maintained unchanged. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ventilation, gas exchange, or circulatory function were not altered significantly by changing the breathing circuit. However, Paw and esophageal pressure fluctuations were altered and were largest during breathing with the circuit that had an exhalation valve with high-flow resistance. The Paw fluctuation recorded while the patient was breathing with the flow-resistor circuit increased with weight and exceeded 2 cm H2O in all patients weighing greater than 4.5 kg. Paw fluctuation could be decreased by greater than 2 cm H2O in ten of 12 patients by using the threshold-resistor circuit. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a need for evaluating the characteristics of respiratory circuits used for spontaneous breathing in infants and children, to avoid unnecessary equipment-related increase in respiratory work.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized control trial of 20 consecutive patients undergoing elective aortic reconstructive surgery. SETTING: A surgical ICU in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients, mean age 64 yr. Five patients had abdominal aneurysm, 12 had aortic obstruction disease, and three had aortic renal bypass surgery. These patients were followed for 1 month. INTERVENTIONS: Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure of at least 10 mm Hg and a urine output greater than 30 mL/h were used to guide the intraoperative fluid infusion rates, which were 36 and 104 mL/kg of D60 and RL, respectively (ratio 1:2.9). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Body weight at 24 hr had increased more with RL (7.8 kg) than with D60 (3.2 kg) infusion (p less than .01), despite intraoperative urine volumes of 151 and 92 mg/kg with RL and D60, respectively. Total intravascular albumin decreased from 0.7 g/kg (1.4 to 0.7 g/kg) in both groups, corresponding to a plasma volume (PV) loss of 13 mg/kg without fluid infusions. A total intravascular dextran of 0.5 g/kg resulted in a PV expansion at 1 hr of 4.4 mL/kg above preoperative level, in sharp contrast to 7.0 mL/kg decrease in PV with RL. Of the intraoperative 3% D60 and RL infused, an estimated 51% D60 and 6% RL remained as PV expansion at 1 hr. CONCLUSIONS: A diluted colloid solution in Ringer's lactate is of significant value in maintaining intravascular volumes and hemodynamics during and after major operative procedures.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of therapeutic changes on the level of energy expenditure (EE) and N excretion in a homogeneous group of patients usually considered hypermetabolic. DESIGN: EE and N excretion of head-injured patients were measured simultaneously at phases 1 and 2 (patients treated 4 +/- 3 and 18 +/- 8 days after injury, respectively). SETTING: Acute care hospital. PATIENTS: Eight severe head-injured patients, mean weight 63.1 +/- 6.1 (SD) kg, mean age 21 +/- 3.8 (SD) yr. INTERVENTIONS: At phase 1, all patients were sedated with fentanyl (6.7 +/- 1.9 micrograms/kg.hr) plus flunitrazepam (9.1 +/- 4.8 micrograms/kg.hr) and were mechanically ventilated. All patients received continuous total parenteral nutrition. The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1092 +/- 200 kcal/day, including 77% glucose and 23% fat (Intralipid 20%). The total N intake averaged 7 +/- 5 g/day, consisting of crystalline amino acids. At phase 2, no patient received any sedative and all were breathing spontaneously via tracheostomy. All patients received parenteral and/or enteral nutrition. The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1929 +/- 200 kcal/day consisting of 65% carbohydrates and 35% fat. The total N intake averaged 13 +/- 2 g/day. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The EE was significantly higher at phase 2 than at phase 1 (2121 vs. 1737 kcal), but the interindividual variability was low at both phases. N excretion was high at the two periods of the study and not correlated to the level of EE. The RQ was 0.75 at both periods, indicating predominant fat oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: We could not demonstrate any parallelism in the evolution of EE and protein catabolism in head-injured patients. The therapeutics (mechanical ventilation, sedation, and nutrition) have a major effect on EE but little on N excretion.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES: a) To determine the variation in methods used to measure minute ventilation (VE) in patients who receive mechanical ventilation; b) to determine the effect of supplemental oxygen on VE, respiratory rate (RR), and tidal volume (VT) measurements. DESIGN: Telephone survey of hospitals, and a randomized control trial. SETTING: Medical and surgical ICUs in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-three patients who had required mechanical ventilation because of the inability to sustain adequate spontaneous ventilation. All patients were considered ready to undergo a weaning trial by their physicians. INTERVENTIONS: Spontaneous VE, RR, VT, and SaO2 were measured both in the presence and absence of supplemental oxygen; measurements were obtained in a randomized manner. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: a) In a telephone survey of hospitals throughout the country, we found that the measurement of VE is variably obtained during room air breathing or in the presence of supplemental oxygen. b) Measurements of VE increased from 11.0 +/- 0.8 L/min while patients received supplemental oxygen to 13.5 +/- 1.1 L/min while patients breathed room air (p less than .001). Of 15 patients who had a VE less than 10 L/min while receiving supplemental oxygen, seven developed a value greater than 10 L/min while breathing room air; thus, a weaning trial might have been inappropriately deferred in these patients. c) Mean SaO2 decreased from 95.0 +/- 0.6% while breathing supplemental oxygen to 90.2 +/- 1.1% while breathing room air (p less than .001). CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of VE in patients being considered for a weaning trial can result in significant oxygen desaturation if obtained during room air breathing, and the values obtained can significantly overestimate the patient's true ventilatory requirements, since most patients receive supplemental oxygen during a weaning trial. Standardized methods of measuring VE in critically ill patients need to be developed.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We compared the hemodynamic effects of four vasodilators in experimental embolic pulmonary hypertension in a randomized controlled trial, using nine pigs weighing 16 to 23 kg. After anesthesia induction and cannulation with arterial, central venous, and thermodilution output pulmonary artery catheters, animals were repetitively embolized with glass beads (60 to 160 mu) in order to establish pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure [PAP] doubled from baseline). Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), isoproterenol, prostacyclin (PGI2), and nifedipine were compared at doses producing equivalent reduction in systemic BP. RESULTS: Only PGE1 and PGI2 decreased both PAP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). PGE1 decreased PAP from 39 +/- 1 to 33 +/- 1 mm Hg; prostacyclin decreased PAP from 38 +/- 1 to 31 +/- 1 mm Hg and produced the largest increase in cardiac output (Qt). Isoproterenol did not change PAP, markedly increased heart rate (162 +/- 8 to 216 +/- 11 beats/min), and resulted in significant arrhythmias. Nifedipine increased PVR from 1044 +/- 113 to 1125 +/- 100 dyne.sec.cm-5 and decreased Qt. CONCLUSIONS: Vasodilators demonstrate unique hemodynamic drug profiles. Isoproterenol infusion is characterized by tachycardia and arrhythmias. Both PGE1 and PGI2 effectively decrease PAP and PVR. Nifedipine depressed Qt significantly in this glass-bead embolization model of acute pulmonary hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of milrinone on pulmonary vasculature. BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that bipyridines or their derivatives may have a selective pulmonary vasodilation effect. METHODS: Preliminary study: milrinone administration to 12 normal dogs (low dose [bolus 75 micrograms/kg for 5 min followed by a continuous infusion at 0.75 micrograms/kg.min, n = 6]; high dose [bolus 150 micrograms/kg for 5 min followed by continuous infusion at 1.5 micrograms/kg.min, n = 6]). Main study: milrinone administration to 18 dogs with pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary embolism induced by a massive injection of autologous muscle cubes. The pulmonary hypertension dogs were divided into three groups: a) group E (n = 6) received embolization only, as control; b) group L (n = 6) received low-dose milrinone; and c) group H (n = 6) received high-dose milrinone, equivalent to the preliminary study group. Hemodynamic measurements and blood samplings were obtained at baseline and at 15, 30, and 60 min after start of milrinone infusion. RESULTS: Milrinone did not change mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) in normal dogs. Milrinone decreased MPAP significantly in dogs with pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary vascular resistance index remained at an almost constant level in normal dogs, but decreased significantly in dogs with pulmonary hypertension. Mean arterial pressure was maintained at a constant level in all groups. High-dose milrinone administration decreased systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) significantly; low-dose milrinone administration decreased SVRI slightly. CONCLUSIONS: Milrinone may have a selective pulmonary vasodilatory effect only in dogs with pulmonary hypertension. The mechanism that produced a selectivity on pulmonary vasculature in dogs with pulmonary hypertension is unknown. However, an inhibition of platelet aggregation may decrease the MPAP resulting from an increase in cAMP caused by milrinone. Further studies are needed to resolve the pulmonary vasodilatory effect of milrinone in dogs with pulmonary hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We demonstrated earlier in our laboratories that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FDP) would improve the outcome of hypoxic ischemic injury to the brain in the adult rabbit. Since many human newborns suffer hypoxic injury to the brain, with a secondary ischemic component due to hypoxic cardiac failure, we set out to reproduce similar experiments in newborn piglets. Hypoxic ischemic CNS damage was induced by ligating both carotid arteries and reducing BP to 66% of normal for 30 min; in the last 15 min, FIO2 was reduced to 0.6. Twelve piglets were randomized to receive either 175 mg/kg of FDP in the last 5 min before reoxygenation or the equivalent volume of saline. The other 20 piglets received 75 mg/kg of FDP in the 5 min immediately before carotid ligation, followed by 1.8 mg/kg.min continuous infusion for the 30 min of hypoxia and ischemia or an equivalent volume of saline. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the neurologic exam scores or pathologic exam scores between the FDP and control animals at either dose level. CONCLUSIONS: In this animal model, FDP at the doses given was not effective in ameliorating hypoxic ischemic injury to the CNS.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective, chart review. SETTING: Inpatients of a large, referral-based hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-six consecutive survivors of ARF who required greater than 4 wk of dialysis support. RESULTS: All 26 patients were critically ill and developed ARF during treatment in an ICU. The clinical course of these patients was characterized by multiple episodes of renal ischemia or nephrotoxin exposure during dialysis dependence. However, despite multiple renal insults and prolonged dialysis support (mean duration 8.4 +/- 0.7 wk), 23 (88%) of the 26 patients recovered sufficient kidney function to discontinue dialysis. Preexisting renal impairment was associated with a greater risk of irreversible renal failure, and, in patients able to discontinue dialysis, renal recovery was often incomplete. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some renal damage, most critically ill patients who survive ARF requiring prolonged dialysis support recover life-sustaining kidney function.\r"

DESIGN: Direct comparison of EVLW-SI with EVLW-DI in 18 critically ill patients. SETTING: A general medical ICU in a university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Nine men and nine women, ages 19 to 80 yr. Six patients were in shock (four from septic shock), and 11 were in respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS: EVLW-DI and cardiac output were measured in triplicate during injection of cold indocyanine green dye. Cardiac output was calculated both from pulmonary artery (COpa) and femoral artery (COfem-di) thermal dilution signals. EVLW-SI and COfem-si were also measured during three additional injections of cold saline using only thermal signals from the pulmonary and femoral arteries. Order of measurements was random. EVLW-SI was measured in ten patients while blood was withdrawn through the femoral catheter and in ten patients without blood drawn through the femoral catheter. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 84 comparisons were made. Although the overall correlations were good (r2 = .86), EVLW-SI systematically overestimated EVLW-DI (p less than .05). This difference was greater when EVLW-SI was measured without blood withdrawal through the femoral catheter. In this subgroup, mean values for EVLW by the two methods were within 20% of one another in only two of ten patients, in contrast to the results in six of eight patients in which blood was withdrawn through the catheter. COfem-si and COfem-di also overestimated COpa. CONCLUSIONS: Theoretically, neither injection of green dye nor blood withdrawal should be necessary during measurements of EVLW-SI, making it a simpler technique for bedside use than EVLW-DI. However, significant discrepancies exist between the two techniques. Some of this difference is apparently due to technical factors related to catheter design. In any case, we cannot recommend use of the single indicator dilution technique at present to estimate EVLW.\r"

INTERVENTIONS: Two-channel multiple wavelength diffuse infrared transmission spectroscopy was interfaced with the scalp using adhesive. Transmission data were collected with gross superficial-to-deep spatial resolution. Saturation calculation based on the deep signal was observed longitudinally in the patient. With the same technology, arterial input and cerebral response functions, generated by iv tracer bolus, were deconvoluted to measure mean cerebral transit time. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A positive linear regression fit between diffuse transmission oximetry and measured blood oxygen saturation over the range 23% to 99% (r2 = .98, p less than .001) was noted.

The technique can be performed clinically without difficulty. A simultaneous measure of mean cortical transit time is possible.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, crossover study design. SETTING: A pediatric ICU in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Informed parental consent was obtained for six patients who were hemodynamically stable and receiving a continuous nitroprusside infusion for a clinical application. Subjects ranged in age from 11 months to 9 yr. INTERVENTIONS: All of the subjects were administered nitroprusside using selected infusion pumps, which included Abbott (Micro), 3M/AVI (210), IMED (965), IVAC (565), and Kendall McGaw (MicroRate). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After an initial equilibration interval for each device, MAP was measured and recorded at 10-sec intervals for greater than or equal to 90-min intervals using a computerized data collection technique. Variation in nitroprusside administration (flow continuity) for each infusion pump was determined in vitro using a computerized gravimetric technique. Variation in both MAP and flow continuity was mathematically expressed as the coefficient of variance (CV) of the measured values for each of the respective infusion pumps. For the Abbott, IMED, 3M/AVI, IVAC, and Kendall McGaw, infusion pumps, mean +/- SD continuity CV values were 85 +/- 31%, 39 +/- 26%, 19 +/- 8%, 17 +/- 3%, and 12 +/- 3%, respectively, and MAP CV values were 18 +/- 21%, 15 +/- 11%, 8 +/- 2%, and 16 +/- 10%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An apparent direct relationship between MAP variability and flow continuity was observed. We speculate that variation in effect of potent short-acting drugs may, in part, be due to infusion pump operation.\r"

Intracerebroventricular infusion of HA (34-540 nmol at -15 min) stimulated PRL secretion dose dependently with an ED50 of approximately 135 nmol. Inhibition of neuronal HA synthesis by the specific histidine decarboxylase-inhibitor (S)alpha-fluoro-methylhistidine (alpha FMH; 100 mumol/kg ip at -6 h or 400 mumol/kg ip at -20 h and -6 h) caused a 50% reduction (P less than 0.01) in the PRL response to 5 min of restraint stress. Inhibition of neuronal HA metabolism by the specific histamine-methyltransferase-inhibitor SKF-91488 (400 and 800 nmol icv at -20 min) augmented the restraint stress-induced PRL release 26% and 37%, respectively (P less than 0.05). The two enzyme inhibitors had no or only modest effect on the basal PRL secretion. Pretreatment with a specific antiserum (0.5 ml) to arginine vasopressin (AVP) or an AVP antagonist (25 nmol) administered iv at -20 min inhibited the PRL response to HA (270 nmol icv) 80% and 45%, respectively (P less than 0.01) and inhibited the PRL response to restraint stress 70% (P less than 0.01). In contrast, pretreatment with a specific oxytocin (OT) antagonist (50 nmol) had no effect on the HA- or stress-induced PRL release. The AVP antiserum showed less than 0.0003% cross-reactivity with OT, and radiolabeled OT did not bind to serial dilutions of plasma from rats treated with the AVP antiserum. The AVP antiserum or the AVP antagonist almost prevented the PRL release induced by iv infusion of 800 pmol AVP or a posterior pituitary extract. Infusion of AVP (24-800 pmol iv at -15 min) stimulated PRL secretion dose dependently. However, the dose of AVP (800 pmol) required to induce an increase in plasma PRL similar to that obtained by HA-stimulation, led to a rise in plasma AVP which was approximately 1000-fold higher than that induced by HA, which increased plasma AVP 2-fold. Restraint stress had no effect on the plasma AVP level. We conclude that neuronal HA participates in the mediation of the PRL response to stress and that the stress- and HA-induced release of PRL may involve AVP, whereas an involvement of OT seems unlikely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We have characterized the sequence elements responsible for the hormone-dependent expression of TG gene in rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells using internal deletion and linker-scanning mutants of the minimal TG promoter (-170 basepairs) fused with the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. The TG gene is regulated by at least two regions located between -165 and -140 bp (TG-III) and between -95 and -65 bp (TG-I) from the transcription initiation site. The intervening region can be deleted without significant effect on the promoter activity. Either of the two regions alone does not promote hormone-dependent transcription. A DNase footprinting assay showed that TG-I and TG-III are the principal protein-binding sites and that the proteins interacting with these two regions are induced by TSH or cAMP. These results suggest that the hormone-dependent expression of TG gene may be achieved by cooperative interaction of the proteins bound to TG-I and TG-III.\r"

Cross-linking of [125I]ET-3 to cerebellum membrane preparations with dissuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) resulted in the labeling of two bands with apparent mol wt of 52 and 30 kDa. Under these conditions the labeling intensities of these two bands were similar. However, addition of 5 mM EDTA to the protease inhibitor mixture during membrane preparations as well as the binding and cross-linking reaction increased the labeling of the 52-kDa protein while reducing the labeling of the 30-kDa protein. Peptide map comparisons of the 52- and 30-kDa protein bands using Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and papain revealed that the 30-kDa band is a proteolytic degradation product of the 52-kDa protein. These results suggest that the 52-kDa protein represents the specific binding protein of ET-3, and thus, the apparent mol wt of the ET receptor is 50 kDa, subtracting the mol wt of the iodinated ET. Since cross-linking of [125I]ET-1 to cerebellum membrane preparations revealed the same two bands of 52 and 30 kDa, peptide mapping of the 52-kDa proteins, cross-linked with either [125I]ET-1 or ET-3, was conducted. Under these experimental conditions, identical peptide fragments were generated by both Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and papain. These results suggest that ET-1 and ET-3 bind to a common brain binding protein with an apparent mol wt of 50 kDa.\r"

Exposure of GH3 cells to epidermal growth factor for 4 consecutive days markedly altered the cell morphology, from a spherical appearance to an elongated flattened shape, and increased the cell size. These morphological changes were accompanied by the functional expression of D2 dopamine receptors as shown by the presence of a specific, saturable, and stereoselective high affinity binding for [3H]spiroperidol in epidermal growth factor-treated cells and by the fact that the selective D2 agonist quinpirole recovered the property to inhibit PRL secretion in the cell cultures exposed to the neurotrophic factor. The effect of EGF on the functional expression of D2 receptors was dose dependent (EC50 = 8 pM) and reversible. These data suggest that EGF elicits major effects on the expression of specific genes leading to the differentiation of GH3 cells into lactotroph-like cells endowed with dopamine D2 receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is synthesized in various tissues, including the anterior pituitary gland, where it may stimulate the release of PRL. Because estrogen plays a central role in the regulation of PRL, it becomes important to determine the effects of this steroid on both pituitary VIP and PRL. To study this, pituitary VIP and PRL and plasma PRL were assayed in ovariectomized rats after treatment with estradiol benzoate (EB; 0.007, 0.07, 0.7, 7 or 70 microgram/rat). Pituitary and plasma TSH were also determined as well as VIP content in the medial basal hypothalamus, suprachiasmatic region, cerebral cortex, and jejunum. Oil-treated rats served as controls. Injection of 0.7 or 7 microgram EB resulted in a significant increase in pituitary PRL without changing plasma PRL levels or pituitary VIP content compared to values in the control group. Only treatment with 70 microgram EB produced a significant increase in both pituitary VIP and PRL as well as in plasma PRL compared to control values. EB treatment at any of the doses used had no significant effect on pituitary and plasma TSH or VIP content in any of the other tissues examined. These data show that pituitary PRL and VIP are differentially regulated in response to estrogen. The increases in pituitary VIP and basal plasma PRL after treatment with the highest dose of EB suggest that pituitary VIP may be involved in the development of estrogen-induced hyperprolactinemia. These data also show that the regulations of pituitary VIP and TSH are independent of each other in the estrogen-treated rat.\r"

  ".W": "In the steroidogenic pathway, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-isomerase (3 beta HSD) catalyzes the formation of hormonally active delta 4-3-ketosteroids from delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroids. In the present study the regulation of 3 beta HSD by ACTH action on bovine adrenocortical (BAC) cells in primary culture was evaluated. Western blot analysis was accomplished using an antibody against human placental 3 beta HSD. The relative molecular mass of 3 beta HSD in these cells was 45K, which was similar to that in human placenta. A significant effect of ACTH was not detected until day 6 of culture due to the high basal levels of the enzyme in BAC cells. Treatment of cells with ACTH on day 8 of culture resulted in a marked increase in the amount of 3 beta HSD protein, and this effect was correlated directly with enzymatic activity. The effects of ACTH were time and dose dependent, with an increase detectable only after 48 h of treatment; the maximal response was obtained with 10(-9) M ACTH. As demonstrated by Northern analysis, ACTH action was manifested by increasing the steady state level of 3 beta HSD mRNA. A human 3 beta HSD cDNA probe, which was used in this study, hybridized to a 1.7-kilobase species of BAC RNA. The effects of ACTH on 3 beta HSD activity and increases in 3 beta HSD protein and mRNA in BAC cells were mimicked by treatment with (Bu)2cAMP. The findings of this study suggest that ACTH controls 3 beta HSD gene expression in BAC cells by a cAMP-dependent mechanism similar to that involved in the expression of steroid hydroxylase genes. However, because the different stabilities of 3 beta HSD and hydroxylase proteins and/or mRNAs may play a critical role in determining the zone-specific steroids secreted from the adrenal cortex, other cAMP-dependent or independent regulatory mechanisms may also be important in regulating the expression of adrenal 3 beta HSD.\r"

  ".W": "In man, acute stress, like extensive surgery, leads to a rapid and prolonged decrease in serum T3 concentrations. The present study was carried out to investigate the mechanisms that underly the abrupt decrease in T3-neogenesis that occurs in response to acute surgical stress. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, surgically thyroidectomized, and treated with 1.2 micrograms T4/100 g BW/day, underwent wide vertical and horizontal incisions extending into the abdominal cavity while receiving light ether anesthesia. Different dietary manipulations were performed to investigate the superimposed influence of reduced carbohydrate and caloric intake on T3-neogenesis. The metabolism of 125I T4 labeled in its outer (phenolic) ring was investigated in liver, kidney, and brain homogenates of animals killed 48 h after surgery. In liver, values for the proportion of T4 degraded and the percent generation of T3 and iodide were unaffected by laparotomy. The percent T3 generation in experiments with 25 nM T4 concentration was 3.7 +/- 1.24% (mean +/- SD) in fed control animals given free access to 5% glucose, 3.4 +/- 0.67% in unoperated controls given a restricted amount of chow and 5% glucose, and 3.8 +/- 0.67% in operated animals given free access to chow and 5% glucose. As expected, T3 neogenesis in livers from unoperated animals was significantly reduced in rats fasted for 48 h and this reduction was similar in laparotomized rats fasted for 48 h after surgery. As in the liver, no effect of laparotomy on T4 metabolism in kidney and brain homogenates was observed. Finally, serum total T4 and T3 concentrations were not affected by surgery. It is concluded that acute surgical stress in thyroidectomized T4 replaced rats does not influence T4 metabolism in liver, kidney, and brain homogenates or affect the serum T4 and T3 concentrations. Since thyroid secretion of T4 (and T3) was eliminated and careful attention was paid to caloric intake in this rat model, previously reported abnormalities in serum thyroid hormone concentrations and T3-neogenesis in various states of nonthyroidal illness in man and rat, including surgery, are probably contributed to by thyroid secretion of T4 (and T3) and caloric deprivation, especially carbohydrate.\r"

In contrast, we have observed a striking difference in the prevalence and intensity of LT in these six sublines, varying from 100% in NB subline rats to 4.9% in BE subline rats at 105-110 days of age. Excess iodide administration frequently increases the prevalence of LT but did not do so in the two sublines (BB and BE) with the lowest frequency of spontaneous LT. In view of this variable prevalence of LT in the different BB/Wor sublines, it is imperative that investigators studying the pathogenesis and modulation of LT in this rat model select those sublines which express a desired frequency of spontaneous LT.\r"

  ".W": "Although a prominent role of conceptuses in the hormonal control of normal parturition in the pig is well founded, mechanisms are entrained that cause a timed relaxin release and an abrupt decrease in progesterone secretion in the complete absence of the uterus. This study focused on the steroidogenic and peptide hormone secretory capacities of aging porcine luteal cells in culture on specific days during a narrow window (days 110-116) when abrupt shifts occur in their function. Dispersed luteal cells (3 x 10(5) cells/well) from hysterectomized and pregnant gilts on days 110, 113, and 116 after estrus were cultured for 24 h with porcine (p) LH, pPRL, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), PGE2, and (Bu)2cAMP. Progesterone and relaxin concentrations in cells preceding culture and in the spent medium were quantified by RIA. Progesterone in cells before culture was less (P less than 0.05) than that released into the medium, while relaxin levels were greater (P less than 0.05) than those in the medium. Relaxin stored in luteal cells of hysterectomized gilts was consistently greater (P less than 0.01) than that during the same days of late pregnancy; however, progesterone was greater (P less than 0.01) in hysterectomized compared with pregnant gilts only on day 116. Relaxin release was greater (P less than 0.01) in hysterectomized compared with pregnant gilts on days 113 and 116, whereas progesterone was greater (P less than 0.05) on days 110 and 116 in hysterectomized compared with pregnant animals. pLH, pPRL, and (Bu)2cAMP increased (P less than 0.05) relaxin secretion in hysterectomized gilts on days 110, 113, and 116, but only on day 110 in pregnant animals. These hormones consistently increased (P less than 0.05) progesterone release only on day 110 in both groups of gilts. PGE1 increased (P less than 0.01) relaxin release in hysterectomized, but not pregnant, gilts; it was not effective in altering progesterone in either group. PGE2 increased the release of both hormones on day 113 in both groups. The percentage of large cells (i.e. greater than 20 microns in diameter) was consistently greater (P less than 0.01) on days 110-116 in hysterectomized compared with pregnant gilts. Both luteal cell relaxin concentrations and the population of electron-dense granules decreased from days 110-116 in pregnant, but not in hysterectomized, gilts; luteal cells from postpartum animals were nearly depleted of granules, and empty vesicles were prominent. The secretory response of the cells to tropic hormone stimulation is preprogrammed from the previous estrus that occurred more than 110 days previously.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We explored chromogranin A's proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, and possible intermolecular disulfide links, using biochemical and cell biological approaches. Anti-chromogranin A region-specific immunoblots on chromaffin granules suggested bidirectional endoproteolytic cleavage of chromogranin A; control experiments ruled out artifactual cleavage during granule isolation or lysis. Isolation of chromogranin A-derived peptides by gel filtration chromatography or sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing, established several cleavage sites, including at least two at dibasic sites. Secretion of chromogranin A from bovine chromaffin cells did not initiate further cleavage, nor did prolonged exposure of secreted chromogranins to the secretory cells. The chromogranin A cleavage pattern was qualitatively similar in other neuroendocrine tissues, though cleavage was more complete in adrenal medullary than in anterior pituitary hormone storage vesicles, and N-terminal fragments of 45 and 55 kilodaltons were more prominent in the hypothalamus. A similar cleavage pattern was seen in human pheochromocytoma granules, as judged by chromogranin A region-specific immunoblots, fragment isolation by SDS-PAGE, and microsequencing. The presence of full-length chromogranin A as the core protein of a chromaffin granule soluble proteoglycan was suggested in bovine (but not human) chromaffin granules by glycoprotein staining, chondroitinase ABC digestion, chemical deglycosylation, and region-specific immunoblotting. Human (but not bovine) chromogranin A displayed intermolecular disulfide crosslinks on SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotting. These results document diverse structural paths that the chromogranin A molecule may take in endocrine secretory cells after its translation.\r"

  ".W": "ACTH release from the anterior pituitary gland is principally driven by the two hypothalamic hormones, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP). Using the reverse hemolytic plaque assay, we have compared the effects of CRH and AVP on ACTH release from individual, dispersed pituitary cells. A small percent (0.36 +/- 0.06%) of pituitary cells formed plaques when exposed to medium alone. AVP caused 3.44 +/- 0.10% of cells to form plaques (P less than 0.01 compared with medium alone), CRH produced 4.85 +/- 0.20% plaque-forming cells (P less than 0.01 compared with AVP), and the combination of CRH and AVP produced a still greater percent of plaque-forming cells (5.80 +/- 0.20%, P less than 0.01 compared with CRH alone). A double reverse hemolytic plaque assay was then employed to examine whether some cells formed plaques only in the presence of one or other secretagogue. Using this technique we found clear evidence of cells that formed plaques in response to CRH but not AVP (P less than 0.005); CRH or AVP (P less than 0.0001), and CRH and AVP (P less than 0.05). There was no evidence of a corticotrope forming a plaque with AVP but not CRH (P = 0.52). Thus there appears to be functionally distinct classes of corticotropes. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the relative responsiveness of the pituitary to hypothalamic secretagogues and provide a new physiological perspective on recent reports of stress-specific hypothalamic responses regulating ACTH release.\r"

Administration of captopril (5 mg/kg, iv) caused a small decrease in mean arterial pressure but did not enhance the hypotensive response to subsequent hemorrhage or nitroprusside infusion. The renin response to both stimuli was enhanced by captopril, whereas the increase in plasma ANG II concentration was attenuated. Plasma VP (PAVP) concentration increased during hemorrhage (2.0 +/- 0.2-113.6 +/- 47.7 pg/ml, P less than 0.01) and nitroprusside infusion (2.1 +/- 0.3-5.1 +/- 1.0 pg/ml, P less than 0.01). Captopril did not change basal plasma PAVP, nor did it attenuate the VP responses to hemorrhage or nitroprusside. Indeed, captopril tended to enhance the VP responses to hemorrhage (2.3 +/- 0.3-147.1 +/- 65.9 pg/ml) and nitroprusside infusion (1.9 +/- 0.2-15.4 +/- 6.0 pg/ml). The relationship between log PAVP and mean arterial pressure during hemorrhage and nitroprusside infusion in the presence of captopril was not different than in the absence of captopril. These results indicate that in conscious rabbits, the renin-angiotensin system does not contribute to the increase in VP secretion during hypotension induced by hemorrhage or nitroprusside infusion.\r"

Porcine uterine fluid was collected by flushing the uterine lumen with saline. Endometrial tissues were extracted with acetic acid. Both uterine fluid and endometrial extracts exhibited inhibition curves parallel to that of authentic MENK in the MENK RIA system. Sephadex G-15 gel filtration chromatographic profiles indicated that both concentrated uterine fluid and endometrial extracts contained two peaks of ir-MENK, a major peak which coeluted with standard MENK, and a minor peak eluting near the void volume (Vo). Reverse phase-HPLC chromatographic profiles also demonstrated two peaks of ir-MENK for concentrated uterine fluid and endometrial extracts, a major peak which coincided with standard MENK, plus a highly hydrophilic peak. The effect of ovarian steroids on the uterine secretion of ir-MENK was examined by measuring ir-MENK in uterine fluids from cyclic and pregnant gilts as well as ovariectomized, ovarian steroid-treated gilts. Day effects (P less than 0.01) were detected for cyclic and pregnant gilts, since values for ir-MENK increased between days 8 and 14 after onset of estrus. In ovariectomized gilts, treatment with progesterone (P4) increased the uterine secretion of ir-MENK (202 +/- 9 vs. 65 +/- 4 pg/ml for control, P less than 0.05). The combined treatment of P4 and estradiol did not further enhance secretion of ir-MENK, while treatment with estradiol did not alter ir-MENK levels relative to values for control gilts. These results indicate the presence of ir-MENK in porcine uterine fluid and endometrium, and suggest that uterine secretion of ir-MENK is regulated primarily by P4.\r"

  ".W": "The present work was designed to compare in vitro cell growth kinetics with in vivo growth under conditions as similar as possible using labeling with [3H]thymidine. To this purpose, FRTL-5 cells were cultured as monolayers and as three-dimensional spheroids embedded in collagen gels and transplanted simultaneously into nude mice treated with perchlorate and a low iodine diet. The growth of the transplants was compared to that of the thyroids in host mice. In the intact thyroid, the fraction of [3H]thymidine-labeled follicular cells (FLC; 24-h labeling) increased sluggishly to a maximum of 10% after 3 weeks of goitrogen exposure, with a subsequent autoregulatory decrease to 3% at 7 weeks. A 4-fold higher FLC was found in six adenomas, indicating focal failure of growth-restraining mechanisms. In nonconfluent monolayer cultures the FLC was as high as 90%, even within large individual clusters where cells are in tight mutual contact. Solid, highly cellular grafts growing from transplanted monodispersed cells showed an average FLC of 20%, which is 5 times higher than the FLC in the identically stimulated mouse thyroid. In collagen-embedded cells, forming three-dimensional spheroids, the mean FLC decreased from 70% at 1 week in vitro (40% in vivo) to 20% at 3 weeks both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting effective auto-regulation of excessive growth in both conditions. However, these FLC were again much higher than the 3% FLC in simultaneously assessed host thyroids. The difference remained throughout the 45-day period studied. We conclude that FRTL-5 cells growing as monolayers and as three-dimensional spheroids in vitro or after xenotransplantation in vivo invariably show much higher proliferation rates under comparable environmental conditions than the normal follicular epithelium in the thyroids of host mice. The one exception is the confluent monolayer with near-zero growth, while densely packed three-dimensional transplants still grow intensively. Although growth-retarding cell to cell interactions are also clearly operative in growing FRTL-5 cells, they are less effective than those dampening the replication rate of the thyrocytes within the monolayer hull of normal follicles. A local failure of these mechanisms, allowing growth rates comparable to those of grafted FRTL-5 cells results in adenoma formation in normal thyroids. These observations call for caution in the transfer of in vitro growth studies with FRTL-5 cells to in vivo conditions prevailing in the normal thyroid.\r"

Stimulation of protein kinase-C by a phorbol ester (0.025-7.5 microM) caused a significant dose-related release of PST (186 +/- 22-4271 +/- 228% over controls). Treatment of BON cells with graded doses of 8-bromo-cAMP (0.14-3.0 mM) and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX; 0.01-1.0 mM) also stimulated a dose-related release of PST (107 +/- 22-284 +/- 28 and 16 +/- 12-1076 +/- 100% over controls, respectively). Incubation of BON cells with ionomycin (0.134-13.4 microM) increased the release of PST (102 +/- 15-554 +/- 21% over controls) in a dose-related manner. A combination of IBMX and ionomycin resulted in an additive effect, whereas treatment with a phorbol ester plus IBMX resulted in a synergistic effect on PST release. Pretreatment of BON cells with monensin, an agent that prevents processing of precursors to smaller peptides, significantly decreased PST, but not CGA, secretion in response to phorbol ester or ionomycin. These findings indicate that protein kinase-C, cAMP, and Ca2+ mobilization participate in CGA and PST secretion. Although the observation that secretions of PST and CGA in response to theophylline are quantitatively associated, the absence of a quantitative relationship in the release patterns of PST and CGA in response to phorbol ester and ionomycin do not support a simple precursor-product relationship between CGA and PST. The monensin experiments are consistent with the notion that PST is derived from CGA in BON cells.\r"

Two mechanisms of Ca++ transport through the basolateral membrane (BLM) have been described: the ATP-dependent and the sodium gradient-dependent transport. In the present study, we investigated the effect of PTH and (Bu)2cAMP on these two mechanisms. We recently reported, using 100 microM Ca++ as the substrate, that whereas the ATP-dependent system was present in the proximal and distal tubule (DCT), the Na+/Ca++ exchanger was located only in the DCT. Using 2 microM Ca++ as the substrate, the Na+/Ca++ exchanger was again found to be present only in the DCT. Incubation of DCT suspension with 10(-8) M bovine PTH (1-34) resulted in a significant increase in the Na(+)-dependent Ca++ uptake by the corresponding BLM vesicles. This effect was dose dependent. The half-maximal stimulation was obtained with 1 X 10(-8) M PTH. At this concentration, PTH increased the maximum velocity (Vmax) from 0.34 +/- 0.06 t 0.54 +/- 0.02 nmol/mg/10 s (P less than 0.05) without influencing the Michaelis-Menten constant (Kms). Incubation of DCT suspensions with (Bu)2cAMP mimicked this effect. The dose-response curve showed a peak action at 1 mM (Bu)2cAMP. In contrast, neither (Bu)2cAMP nor PTH influenced the ATP-dependent Ca++ transport through BLM from proximal tubule nor DCT. It is proposed that PTH influences Ca++ reabsorption by the DCT because the target molecule, the Na+/Ca++ exchanger, is located exclusively at this site.\r"

  ".W": "The osteoclast is known to be derived from the hemopoietic stem cell, but its lineage and the mechanisms by which its differentiation is regulated are largely unknown. There is evidence that osteoclastic differentiation is induced through a contact-dependent interaction between bone marrow stromal cells and hemopoietic precursors. To analyze osteoclastic lineage, colonies were generated in semi-solid medium from mouse spleen cells in the presence of erythropoietin with either Wehi 3B-conditioned medium or interleukin 3 (IL3). After 7 days, individual colonies were picked. Half of each colony was phenotyped by the morphology of cells in cytospin preparations; the second half of each was incubated for 7 days with a bone marrow-derived cell line (ts8) that induces osteoclastic differentiation from hemopoietic cells, on bone slices in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. After incubation, bone resorption was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. No resorption was induced in cells derived from single-lineage colonies, but resorptive cells differentiated in 17% of granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colonies and 38% of multilineage colonies. Since only a minority of GM colonies contained osteoclastic precursors, this suggests that the GM colonies that contained osteoclasts were not typical GM colonies but may have been a form of multilineage colony analagous to other multilineage colonies that contain granulocytes, macrophages, and a third cell type. No resorptive cells were formed when IL3-derived colonies were incubated on bone slices without ts8 cells. The results suggest that osteoclasts are derived from a multilineage precursor, upon which IL3 acts to generate cells capable of osteoclastic differentiation, which form resorptive cells upon incubation with bone marrow stromal cells in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.\r"

  ".W": "Estradiol assumes a major role in the regulation of growth, vascularization, and progesterone synthesis in the midpregnant rat corpus luteum. To explore whether molecular events triggered by estradiol could be mediated, at least in part, by protein phosphorylation, we investigated whether estradiol treatment in vivo affects endogenous luteal protein phosphorylation systems detectable in vitro. Luteal nuclear, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions were obtained by differential centrifugation from rats hypophysectomized and hysterectomized on day 12 of pregnancy and treated with or without estradiol for 72 h. Using [gamma-32P]ATP as phosphate donor, proteins were phosphorylated in the presence or absence of either calcium (Ca), Ca plus calmodulin, or Ca plus phospholipid. Phosphoproteins were separated by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The Coomassie blue stained proteins and phosphoprotein profiles were markedly different in the various fractions. Estradiol treatment in vivo caused an increase in the basal endogenous phosphorylation of several proteins in vitro. It also substantially enhanced the protein kinase C (PKC) and Ca-calmodulin kinase-dependent phosphorylation of selected proteins in subcellular fractions. The Ca-calmodulin kinase catalyzed phosphorylation of microsomal 56 and 60 kilodalton (kDa) proteins was remarkably increased by estradiol. Proteins (56 and 60 kDa) were also phosphorylated when Ca-calmodulin was added to the nuclear fraction, however, this phosphorylation did not appear to be affected by estradiol treatment. A major PKC substrate in the nuclear fraction was an 80 kDa protein whose phosphorylation was increased remarkably by estradiol treatment. In the mitochondrial fraction the most striking effect of estradiol was a marked increase in PKC-mediated phosphate transfer into a 76 kDa substrate. To determine whether estradiol action on protein phosphorylation was related to its tropic effect in the corpus luteum, the hormone was administered to day 10 hypophysectomized and hysterectomized pregnant rats. In this rat model, where estradiol has no stimulatory effect on either luteal steroidogenesis or growth, neither endogenous nor kinase-mediated phosphorylation was affected by this steroid. In summary, the present investigation has revealed that in vivo treatment with estradiol affects the PKC and the Ca-calmodulin dependent in vitro phosphorylation of selected proteins localized in different subcellular compartments and further suggests that phosphorylation systems are potential control points for estradiol regulation of rat corpus luteum function.\r"

This experiment was conducted to determine if LHRH-ir terminals interact synaptically with ER-ir cells. A light microscopic dual chromogen immunocytochemical technique employing diaminobenzidine (DAB) and nickel-enhanced DAB for LHRH and ER localization, respectively, revealed that many varicose LHRH-ir fibers coursed in close proximity to ER-ir cells in the anterior part of the preoptic area at the preventricular periventricular nucleus (Pep), suggesting the likelihood of synaptic interactions. Ultrastructural analysis was performed using DAB and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) for LHRH and ER localization, respectively. DAB labeling in LHRH-ir neurons appeared as a dense flocculent product dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. TMB stained ER-ir neurons contained electron dense crystalline spicules located predominantly in their nuclei. Numerous TMB labeled ER-ir neurons were present in the Pep, and occasionally occurred in clusters, closely apposed to one another. Many LHRH-ir terminals made synaptic contact or were apposed to unlabeled dendrites, while fewer contacted perikarya. Most significantly, ER-ir neurons showing clear evidence of intranuclear TMB crystals received synaptic input from LHRH-ir terminals. In addition, LHRH-ir terminals lacking synaptic specializations were also in direct apposition to ER-ir perikarya. These results provide morphological evidence that LHRH-ir neurons can regulate ER-ir neurons in the preoptic area. Since LHRH-ir cells are thought to be regulated by estrogen responsive neurons, interaction of LHRH terminals with ER-ir cells may represent a regulatory feedback circuit between the two systems.\r"

The present study was designed to reinvestigate the intracellular distribution of spirolactone-binding sites, using autoradiography. For this purpose, rabbit kidney pyramids were incubated at 30 C with tritiated SC9420 or aldosterone. Thereafter, aldosterone-sensitive cortical collecting tubules were microdissected and processed for dry film autoradiography. The concentration was 2 nM for both steroids. Non-specific labeling was determined by incubations with tritiated steroids plus a 100-fold excess of unlabeled steroids. Results show the presence of specific nuclear labeling for both [3H] aldosterone and [3H]SC9420. Specific cytoplasmic labeling was very low for both [3H]aldosterone and [3H]SC9420. The nuclear labeling by [3H]SC9420 was equally and almost completely displaced by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled aldosterone or SC9420 (91% and 87%, respectively). We conclude that spironolactone-receptor complexes migrate into the nucleus. The difference between these results and those of previous studies with biochemical techniques, which failed to detect specific nuclear binding of spirolactone, may be due to methodological reasons.\r"

This reduction of [Ca++]i results from coordinate actions of GAP on K+ and Ca++ conductances and may explain the inhibitory effect of GAP on hormonal secretion by PRL-secreting cells.\r"

This study examines the differentiational effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in authentic murine bone marrow immature uncommitted precursor cells collected by pretreatment of murine bone marrow with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Early precursor cells, collected 1 day after 5-FU treatment, are characterized by low expression of the colony-stimulating factor-1. (CSF-1) receptor and dependence on both CSF-1 and interleukin-1 for growth. Intermediate precursors were collected 5 days after 5-FU treatment and required either CSF-1 or interleukin-3 for growth. Intermediate precursors expressed relatively higher levels of the CSF-1 receptor. Addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to these populations inhibited proliferation, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation and soft agar colony assay. Furthermore, 1,25-(OH)2D3 caused a more rapid appearance of the CSF-1 receptor in early precursor cells in a dose-dependent metabolite-specific manner. Conversely, CSF-1 receptor expression was decreased in intermediate precursors treated with the steroid. This decrease in receptor expression was also dose dependent and metabolite specific. These findings demonstrate that 1,25-(OH)2D3 1) targets to authentic bone marrow macrophages at various stages of differentiation and 2) modulates expression of the CSF-1 receptor, a protein which, in turn, regulates monocytic maturation.\r"

Both substrates inhibited autophosphorylation and exogenous kinase activity when added before, but not after, receptor activation with ATP. When H2b was added before ATP, insulin stimulated exogenous kinase activity of diabetic-derived receptors was significantly higher (approximately 50%) than control values at low H2b concentrations, but significantly lower (approximately 50%) than control values at high H2b concentrations, suggesting a decrease in the apparent Km and maximal velocity of the diabetic receptor tyrosine kinase toward H2b. When receptors were allowed to maximally autophosphorylate before the addition of H2b, the maximal H2b kinase activity of diabetic-derived receptors was only approximately 25% lower than that of controls. These effects were not attributable to altered ATP kinetics. Insulin receptor kinase activity toward the substrate poly-Glu-Tyr (4:1) was unaltered by insulinopenic diabetes. Insulin receptor alpha-beta dimers were not detectable in either control or diabetic-derived preparations. We conclude that the impairment of hepatic insulin receptor kinase activity associated with insulinopenic diabetes reflects a decreased ability to maximally activate, which is enhanced when the receptor is activated in the presence of some substrates, e.g. H2b. Impaired signalling by the diabetic-derived receptor appears to be dependent on the type of substrate and its concentration.\r"

The distribution of progesterone receptors (PR) in the pre- and postovulatory follicles was determined in hens by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis. Monoclonal antibodies to chicken PR, PR6, and PR 13, were used. PR were localized in nuclei of theca externa fibroblasts and germinal epithelial cells in stigma and nonstigma regions of the third largest preovulatory follicle (F3). In the largest preovulatory follicle (F1), PR were present in theca externa fibroblasts, germinal epithelial cells, and also in granulosa cells and some of the theca interna fibroblasts in the stigma and nonstigma region. Twenty-four hours after ovulation, PR in the fibroblasts of the theca externa of the postovulatory follicle (POF) were remarkably reduced, but the amount of PR in the granulosa cells was similar to that observed in the F1. A high density of PR was also found in the fibroblasts, arterial wall, and smooth muscle fibers in the loose connective tissue of pre- and postovulatory follicles. Western blot analysis indicated that PR in the granulosa and theca tissue were identical in molecular weight to PR in the shell gland. Western blot analysis also confirmed the changes in the amounts of PR in the pre- and postovulatory follicles as determined by immunocytochemistry. The relative amounts of PR in the granulosa cells as determined by Western blot analysis was F2 less than F1 = POF, and in theca tissue was F2 = F1 greater than POF. The presence of PR in specific ovarian tissues suggests that these tissues are target tissues for progesterone and that progesterone may have a role in regulating follicular maturation and ovulation through receptor-mediated pathways.\r"

Stress caused by a novel environment or by insulin-induced hypoglycemia resulted in moderate increases in plasma ACTH, which were of similar magnitude in both hyponatremic and normonatremic rats, and these stressors caused no increase in plasma AVP and OT levels in either group of rats. However, when exposed to ether, hyponatremic rats exhibited a significantly blunted ACTH response compared to normonatremic controls (331 +/- 49 vs. 740 +/- 124 pg/ml; P less than 0.01, respectively), and plasma AVP levels were markedly increased in the normonatremic, but not in the hyponatremic, rats. Intravenous infusion of 2 M NaCl also caused an ACTH release in hyponatremic rats that was significantly smaller than that in their normonatremic counterparts (228 +/- 52 vs. 479 +/- 85 pg/ml; P less than 0.05, respectively), and in this case both plasma AVP and OT levels were markedly increased in the normonatremic, but not in the hyponatremic, rats. However, hyponatremic rats exhibited greatly increased plasma ACTH levels 2 and 96 h after adrenalectomy (ADX), which were statistically equivalent to the increases in ACTH levels in normonatremic rats after ADX. Seven days after ADX parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus showed strongly increased CRF-41 and AVP-neurophysin, but not OT-neurophysin, immunoreactivities in both normonatremic and hyponatremic rats. These results show that parvocellular CRF-41/AVP-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus are not inhibited by chronic hyponatremia, in contrast to magnocellular neurons, and suggest that ACTH secretion induced by ether or hypertonic saline, but not by novel environment or insulin-induced hypoglycemia, is partially mediated by magnocellular AVP and/or OT.\r"

  ".W": "The presence and specific structures of the oligosaccharides on TSH have been shown to be important for its production and bioactivity. Since the carbohydrate structure of a protein reflects the glycosylation apparatus of the host cells in which the protein is expressed, we examined the biological activity and metabolic clearance of a preparation of purified recombinant human (rh) TSH derived from a stable transfectant of Chinese hamster ovary cells. Carbohydrate compositional analysis of this rTSH showed it to be more highly sialylated than a nonrecombinant, cadaver-derived pituitary hTSH. In addition, no N-acetyl galactosamine was detectable in rhTSH, which implies the absence of terminal sulfate moieties, both of which are present in pituitary-derived TSH. The immunologic activity and porcine TSH receptor-binding activity of the preparation of rhTSH were 3- to 4-fold lower than those of a standard pituitary hTSH. The rhTSH showed a maximum stimulatory activity similar to that of pituitary hTSH in two different in vitro bioassays. However, rhTSH elicited about 3-fold and 5-fold less cAMP than pituitary TSH after stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in bovine thyroid membranes and the rat FRTL-5 cell line, respectively. Removal of sialic acid did not alter the immunologic activity of rhTSH. However, the potencies of rhTSH in receptor-binding, adenylyl cyclase, and FRTL-5 assays were increased 2.4-, 2.6- and 26.7-fold, respectively after sialic acid removal. These data suggest that the in vitro biological activity of rhTSH is influenced by its highly sialylated oligosaccharide chains. The rhTSH had a 2-fold lower metabolic clearance rate than pituitary TSH, resulting in a greater than 10-fold higher serum concentration of rhTSH at 3 h as compared to pituitary hTSH. After sialic acid removal, the rhTSH was cleared faster (7.5-fold) than pituitary hTSH, showing that its longer plasma half-life was due to its higher sialylation. Biologically active rhTSH should be of clinical value in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with thyroid cancer and as a pure hTSH reference preparation.\r"

  ".W": "By means of RNAase protection assay with an antisense cRNA probe, we have shown that the liver of the young adult male rat contains androgen receptor (AR) mRNA to a level of 4% compared to the prostate. Steady state levels of AR mRNA in the liver show both sex and age specificity. Compared to that of the male, the female liver contains a markedly reduced amount of AR mRNA. AR mRNA is almost undetectable in livers of prepubertal male (less than 35 days old) and senescent male (greater than 750 days old) rats. Both prepubertal and senescent animals are relatively insensitive to the androgenic induction of alpha 2u-globulin, a hepatic secretory protein. The age-dependent decline in hepatic androgen sensitivity and AR mRNA level can be delayed considerably by a 40% reduction in the dietary calorie intake. Analysis of poly(A)-containing RNA from two liver cell populations, hepatocytes and nonhepatocytes, revealed that only the hepatocytes that express alpha 2u-globulin gene contain AR mRNA. From these results and our earlier observation of in vitro induction of alpha 2u-globulin in isolated rat liver, we conclude 1) that androgen can act directly on hepatocytes to promote alpha 2u-globulin synthesis; 2) that changes in the hepatic androgen sensitivity during maturation and aging are reflections of the age-dependent expression of the receptor gene; and 3) that retardation of the age-dependent loss of androgen sensitivity by calorie restriction is due to a concomitant delay in the decline of the hepatic AR mRNA level.\r"

  ".U": "91099167\r", 
  ".W": "Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) has been shown previously to induce striking alterations of bovine adrenocortical cell steroidogenic functions. One of the major lesions was characterized as a loss of steroid-17 alpha-hydroxylase activity, a key step in the biosynthetic pathway leading to active corticosteroid hormones. The mechanism of this negative effect of TGF-beta 1 on adrenocortical differentiated functions was investigated. It was observed that: 1) bovine adrenocortical 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity rapidly decreased in cells exposed to TGF-beta 1, in a time (10-20 h)-dependent manner; 2) immunoblotting of the corresponding cytochrome P-450(17) alpha showed that the loss of activity was superimposable to the decrease of the cellular protein content; 3) the cell content in 17 alpha-hydroxylase messenger RNA sharply dropped under TGF-beta 1 treatment (70-75% loss within 3-4 h) as determined by Northern blot analysis; 4) TGF-beta 1 inhibited as well the induction of P-450(17) alpha normally observed under adrenocorticotropin treatment; and 5) these TGF-beta 1 effects were selectively directed toward P-450(17) alpha expression, whereas another major steroidogenic cytochrome, i.e. P-450scc, was not affected. These observations showed that TGF-beta 1 is a potent negative modulator of 17 alpha-hydroxylase expression in bovine adrenocortical cells, very possibly at the transcriptional level. TGF-beta 1 (whose gene is expressed in these cells) may thus be examined as a possible autocrine inhibitory factor implied in the regulation of adrenocortical differentiated functions, in balance with ACTH, which represents the major positive signal in this system.\r"

  ".W": "Regulation of the truncation of LH receptors was investigated in two types of mouse tumor Leydig cells (MA10 and MLTC-1), rat testis Leydig cells (RTL), and a rat tumor Leydig cell (R2C). Receptor numbers were measured by binding [125I]hCG to the cells cultured in monolayers. Addition of 3.3 nM LH for 2 h at 34 C had no detectable effect on binding sites in RTL or R2C cells, but in MA10 and MLTC-1 cells it caused a loss in binding sites. The effect on MA10 and MLTC-1 cells could be mimicked by inhibiting receptor internalization with 5 mM NaN3 and prevented by the addition of protease inhibitors. Incubating RTL and R2C cells with protease inhibitors caused a 2- to 3-fold increase in binding sites and a 2- to 3-fold increase in LH (0.033 and 0.33 nM)-stimulated cAMP production. When RTL and MA10 cells were incubated in the presence of [125I]hCG, a radioactive protein complex with an approximate mol wt of 80,000-90,000 was released into the incubation medium. We conclude that LH receptors are regulated by proteolysis at the plasma membrane in both mouse and rat Leydig cells. Furthermore, truncation of the LH receptor in the mouse Leydig cells is involved in down-regulation, whereas in the rat it is a continuous process.\r"

Several indirect lines of evidence have suggested that cervical ripening is accompanied by collagen degradation. In this study, immunochemical methods have been developed to identify and analyze type I collage degradation in the cervix of the pregnant guinea pig. Using cyanogen bromide-derived peptides of purified guinea pig type I collagen as an immunogen, a polyclonal rabbit antiserum was prepared that recognizes epitopes on the denatured and degraded alpha 2 chain of type I collagen as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and immunoblotting. This antibody was used to demonstrate degradation of type I collagen in the extracellular matrix of the dilated cervix at parturition. Moreover, physiological concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol stimulated degradation of type I collagen in the nonpregnant cervix in organ culture. Collagenase degradation products were detected in the extracellular matrix and in the culture media. The effect of 17 beta-estradiol (10(-6) M) was completely blocked by progesterone (10(-4) M). These studies suggest that dilatation of the guinea pig cervix at parturition may be associated with estrogen-mediated degradation of type I collagen.\r"

Testosterone treatment of castrated rats normalized lipolysis as well as beta-adrenoceptor number. These results demonstrate that testosterone stimulates catecholamine-induced lipolysis in vivo by increasing the number of beta-adrenoceptors as well as the activity of adenylate cyclase, confirming previous in vitro studies performed in adipose precursor cells.\r"

These studies reveal a high level expression of androgen receptor in the undifferentiated cells that comprise the mesenchymal core of the gubernaculum in early development. However, during the morphological alterations of the gubernaculum into a muscular structure, the level of androgen receptor detected in these cells declines, with minimal immunoreactivity present 2 weeks postpartum.

The steady state levels of LH/hCG receptor mRNA were determined in rat ovaries during hCG-induced down-regulation of the receptor. Northern blots were performed using a 20-mer probe corresponding to a guanine cytosine-rich carboxyl-terminal untranslated region of the LH/hCG receptor cDNA. The hybridization of the probe to LH/hCG receptor mRNA was highly specific, since the probe hybridized only to rat luteal cell RNA fraction, with no signal detected in nontarget tissues. The LH/hCG receptor level was quantitated by [125I]hCG binding to the isolated membrane fractions from the corresponding treatment and control groups. Examination of mRNA levels of the receptor during hCG-induced down-regulation showed a steady decrease from 0-24 h, followed by a gradual increase to control levels from 24-72 h corresponding to days 8-9 of pseudopregnancy. The [125I]hCG-binding activity during down-regulation paralleled the mRNA profile in both the experimental and control groups. Examination of the levels of mRNA for alpha-actin showed no change during this period, suggesting that the loss of LH/hCG receptor mRNA at 24 h was not due to a general loss of mRNA in luteal cells. These results suggest that hCG-induced down-regulation of the LH/hCG receptor in luteal cells involves regulation of the receptors at the message level.\r"

In contrast, the human glucagon gene does not contain a similar CRE, and the results of studies using immortalized rat and hamster islet cell lines have suggested that glucagon gene expression may not be regulated by cAMP. To reconcile these observations, we have studied the control of glucagon gene expression. Incubation of primary rat islet cell cultures with forskolin in the presence of low (0.5 g/liter) or high (2.0 g/L) glucose resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the levels of glucagon mRNA transcripts. Forskolin also stimulated the secretion and synthesis of immunoreactive glucagon. The importance of the protein kinase-A-dependent pathway in the regulation of glucagon gene expression was also examined in hamster islet InR1-G9 cells. Cotransfection of a glucagon-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion gene containing the glucagon CRE and a cDNA encoding the catalytic subunit of protein kinase-A resulted in stimulation of glucagon-CAT activity in hamster islet cells. Catalytic subunit cotransfection also activated somatostatin-CAT, but no activation of RSVCAT was detected. The results of these experiments suggest that the rat glucagon gene is regulated by a protein kinase-A-dependent pathway in the endocrine pancreas.\r"

In order to determine whether RA stimulates the hCG secretion by other trophoblastic cell lines, we evaluated the effect of RA on hCG, hCG-alpha subunit (hCG-alpha), and progesterone secretion in three choriocarcinoma cell lines: JEG-3, JAR, and BeWo. RA stimulated hCG and hCG-alpha secretion in a dose-dependent fashion by each of the three cell lines. The time required to give a statistically significant increment of hCG and hCG-alpha over control cells was 48 h. The addition RA to cholera toxin (10 micrograms/ml) resulted in an additive or synergistic stimulation of hCG and hCG-alpha secretion by the three cell lines. Cycloheximide (1 microM) abolished the effect of RA on hCG and hCG-alpha secretion in the BeWo cell line. Progesterone secretion in response to RA was inconsistent. Progesterone secretion by both JEG-3 and BeWo cell lines were stimulated at high concentrations of RA (1 x 10(-6], whereas progesterone secretion by JAR cells was not stimulated. Intracellular levels of cAMP were not affected by RA treatment in the JEG and JAR cells. In the dosages used, RA did not significantly alter cell number in any of the cell lines. RA in physiologic concentrations stimulates hCG and hCG-alpha secretion by three choriocarcinoma cell lines in vitro. Whether RA is a physiologic mediator of placental hormone production is unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Although the effects of low concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on bone formation and resorption are well described, little is known of the effects of E2 on bone at concentrations that circulate during pregnancy. We, therefore, investigated the effects of administration of high dose E2 to 3-month-old female Wistar rats on biochemical and histomorphometric indices of bone formation and resorption. Animals receiving exogenous E2 (4 mg/kg.day for 17 days; n = 9) showed a mean serum E2 concentration of 17.5 +/- 2.9 nM, compared with 0.6 +/- 0.2 nM in those receiving vehicle alone (n = 10). The bone formation rate, measured at the proximal tibial metaphysis after the administration of double fluorochrome labels, was greatly increased in the E2 group (13.6 +/- 2.0 x 10(-2) microns3/microns2.day) compared to controls (3.9 +/- 0.9), as was serum alkaline phosphatase (E2, 133.6 +/- 10.1 IU; controls, 87.5 +/- 5.5). This increase in the rate of bone formation was associated with a significant increase in trabecular bone volume. E2 treatment did not affect urinary hydroxyproline excretion or histomorphometric indices of bone resorption. These findings suggest that high concentrations of E2 strongly stimulate the formation of trabecular bone. This may represent an important mechanism by which calcium stores are accumulated during pregnancy in rats, in anticipation of the mineral requirements of lactation.\r"

  ".W": "Endogenous and exogenous phosphomannosyl ligands inhibit binding of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) to the IGF-II/mannose-6-phosphate receptor (IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor). In the present study, the mechanism of this antagonism was examined using a [125I]IGF-II cross-linking assay with disuccinimidyl suberate in cell membranes. Treatment with 5 mM Man-6-P enhanced [125I]IGF-II cross-linking to the receptor. The magnitude of the Man-6-P enhancement differed depending on the source of the membranes, ranging from a 30% increase in JEG-3 human choriocarcinoma up to a 560% increase in B16-F1 mouse melanoma. Man-6-P stimulated [125I]IGF-II-receptor cross-linking in H-35 hepatoma membranes by about 80%, even at concentrations of labeled IGF-II (greater than or equal to 10 nM) that nearly saturated the receptors. Thus, in addition to its effect on IGF-II-binding affinity, Man-6-P caused a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in cross-linking efficiency within the IGF-II-receptor complex. Furthermore, Man-6-P enhanced [125I]IGF-II cross-linking to the H-35 receptor by a constant (approximately 80%) increment 1) when the cross-linking reaction was conducted in buffers of different pH over the range 6.8-8.0, or 2) using cross-linking agents differing in spacer arm length from 6.4-16.1 A. Washing membranes before assay with either Man-6-P (pH 7.4) or 0.5 M NaCl (pH 4.5) reduced the subsequent Man-6-P enhancement of [125I]IGF-II-receptor cross-linking, suggesting that this phenomenon was actually due to displacement of inhibitory phosphomannosyl ligands bound endogenously to the Man-6-P sites of the receptor. In support of this hypothesis, Man-6-P produced a minimal (8-14%) enhancement of [125I]IGF-II-receptor cross-linking in membranes from I-cell fibroblasts lacking such phosphomannosyl ligands. Thus, phosphomannosyl ligands bound to the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor decrease both IGF-II-binding affinity and IGF-II-receptor cross-linking efficiency. Membrane-associated receptors appear to exist in experimentally and perhaps functionally distinct populations, depending on occupancy of the Man-6-P-binding sites.\r"

  ".U": "91099178\r", 
  ".W": "Having previously observed that T4 and T3 levels in fetal rat brain and brown adipose tissue are clearly higher than expected from their low circulating levels, we have now studied thyroid hormone concentrations and 5'-deiodinase activities (5'D) in several other rat fetal tissues during the last 6 days of gestation (dg), namely 17-22 dg. This period comprises the onset of fetal thyroid activity. Total thyroidal T4 and T3 contents increased 100- and 400-fold, respectively; T4 concentrations increased 8- to 10-fold in plasma, carcass, lung, and liver, and T3 increased 4.5- to 9-fold, except in plasma and liver, where T3 levels increased less than 2-fold in plasma and 3-fold in liver. During this developmental period 5'D activity increased 5- and 10-fold in fetal liver and lung, respectively. In fetuses from hypothyroid [thyroidectomized (T)] dams, body weight was lower than in fetuses from normal dams. Total thyroidal T4 and T3 contents were initially the same, but decreased markedly in fetuses from T dams by the end of gestation. At the earliest fetal ages studied (17-18 dg) T4 and T3 concentrations were lower in carcass, liver, lung, and brain, although near term there were no consistent differences between the fetal tissues from T and control dams, probably because of compensatory stimulation of thyroidal secretion. Liver 5'D was decreased by 50% throughout gestation, and lung 5'D activities were lower by the end of gestation. Thyroid hormones in placentas from T dams were very low, but increased by the end of gestation because of the contribution by the fetal thyroid. Present results describe the ontogenic profiles for thyroid hormone concentrations and 5'D activities during late fetal development; active regulatory mechanisms are already present at this age. It has been frequently stated that rat fetuses near term are deficient in thyroid hormones, and that their thyroid hormone economy is independent of maternal thyroid status, but present results show that near term, T4 and T3 concentrations in several tissues reach levels that are 50% or more of those described for adult animals, and that fetal thyroid function is influenced by maternal hypothyroidism.\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to study the effect of diabetes on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in ovariectomized rats treated with estradiol (E2). Ovariectomized 60 day old female rats were assigned to control (C, n = 42), diabetic (D, n = 47) or insulin-treated diabetic (DI, n = 16) groups. Diabetes was induced with an injection of streptozotocin in the D and DI groups. In the C, D, and DI groups, estrogen was replaced by implanting blank, 5 micrograms or 20 micrograms E2 pellets sc. Pituitary LH responsiveness to GnRH was assessed in C and D animals. Anterior hypothalamic and midhypothalamic concentrations of proGnRH and GnRH, pituitary LH and FSH and serum levels of LH, and E2 were measured by RIA. Anterior hypothalamic proGnRH concentrations were decreased in diabetic rats treated with 5 micrograms E2 compared to 5 micrograms E2 control animals (P less than 0.05). Midhypothalamic GnRH concentrations were also reduced in D vs. C animals despite comparable estrogen therapy (P less than 0.004). GnRH-stimulated LH levels were greater in E2-treated diabetic females than in similarly treated control rats (P less than 0.001). D and DI animals were more sensitive than controls to the inhibitory effect of estrogen on basal LH levels. Pituitary LH and FSH content was lower in 20 micrograms E2-replaced animals but was not influenced by the diabetic state. These data demonstrate a diabetes-induced decrease in hypothalamic proGnRH and GnRH concentration which is not corrected with E2 replacement. The hyper-responsiveness of the diabetic rat pituitary to GnRH also suggests a chronic lack of GnRH stimulation from the hypothalamus but a continued ability of the pituitary to respond to GnRH.\r"

  ".U": "91099180\r", 
  ".W": "A RIA for bovine parathyroid chromogranin-A (CgA) was developed and used to study the regulation of CgA synthesis and release in cultured bovine parathyroid cells. As previously demonstrated, an elevated medium calcium concentration (2.5 mM) led to a reduced release of CgA into the medium. In contrast, the intracellular concentration of CgA was not changed by alterations in the medium calcium concentration. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] stimulated a dose-dependent increase in the release of CgA, whereas intracellular CgA levels were not markedly altered. Alterations in medium calcium concentration did not affect CgA mRNA levels, whereas 1,25-(OH)2D3 caused a time- and dose-dependent increase in CgA mRNA levels. Therefore, changes in CgA release occurred in response to calcium and 1,25-(OH)2D3, with little change in the intracellular CgA concentration. This could arise by a change in the synthetic rate to match the alteration in the secretion rate and/or a change in the degradation rate. Calcium does not appear to affect CgA synthesis at a pretranslational level, whereas 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulated a marked increase in CgA mRNA levels via an effect on CgA gene transcription. Furthermore, 1,25-(OH)2D3 had no effect on CgA mRNA stability. The relationship between steady state levels of CgA mRNA and total CgA levels (intracellular and extracellular) is not simple and possibly indicates that an important regulatory step for CgA synthesis occurs at the level of mRNA translation. The effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on CgA mRNA levels was not modulated by medium calcium concentrations. In addition, the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in reducing PTH mRNA levels was not affected by medium calcium concentrations, with 1,25-(OH)2D3 and calcium acting independently to reduce PTH mRNA levels.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the effects of homologous rat PRL (rPRL) and rat GH (rGH) on islet growth as indicated by modifications in insulin secretion, islet cell proliferation, and islet volume with neonatal and adult rat islets in vitro. The number of proliferating cells was determined by immunocytochemical staining for 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporated into replicating DNA during the final 24 h of culture. When neonatal rat islets were examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy, more than 90% of the BrdU-labeled nuclei were observed in B-cells with insulin immunoreactivity. In neonatal rat islets, rPRL was much more effective than rGH in increasing insulin secretion (3.7-fold vs. 1.4-fold) during the 10 days of culture. The number of BrdU-labeled nuclei per islet was increased from 2.9 +/- 0.4 (n = 77) in control islets to 47.3 +/- 2.7 (n = 95) with rPRL (16.3-fold) and 9.7 +/- 0.8 (n = 84) with rGH (3.3-fold). The effects of rPRL and rGH on both insulin secretion and BrdU labeling were approximately additive. After 10 days, an increased average islet volume was only observed with rPRL. When followed for 36 days, the total amount of islet tissue was unchanged for control islets (1.1-fold), more than doubled with rPRL (2.5-fold), and only slightly increased with rGH (1.4-fold). From the observed rates of islet cell proliferation and increases in islet volumes, doubling times of 23-24 days for rPRL and 89-91 days for rGH can be estimated. Of other proposed islet growth factors, cholecystokinin, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and 2-aminoisobutyric acid, an increase in insulin secretion and islet cell proliferation was only observed with cholecystokinin in neonatal rat islets. However, both effects were less than 20% of those observed with rPRL. In adult rat islets, rPRL was also more effective than rGH in increasing insulin secretion (1.6-fold vs. 1.2-fold) during the 9 days of culture. The number of BrdU-labeled nuclei per islet was increased from 2.7 +/- 0.5 (n = 96) in control islets to 9.5 +/- 0.6 (n = 175) with rPRL (3.5-fold). In contrast to the neonatal islets, rGH had no effect on the number of BrdU-labeled nuclei per islet in adult rat islets (2.4 +/- 0.3, n = 194).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that placental low density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake is decreased in baboons treated with antiestrogen and we have proposed, therefore, that estrogen regulates placental LDL uptake and use during primate pregnancy. In the present study, an alternate in vivo approach was employed to determine whether restoration of estrogen in animals in which the formation of estrogen was decreased would reverse the decline in LDL uptake. Placental estrogen was suppressed by removing the fetus (fetectomy) and thus adrenal androgens on day 100 of baboon gestation (term is 184 days). Placental LDL uptake was determined on day 160 after fetectomy alone, and after fetectomy and sc administration of the estrogen precursor androstenedione (50 to 150 mg every 10 days). Placental cells (10(6] were dispersed with 0.1% collagenase, isolated via 50% Percoll gradient centrifugation, then incubated at 37 C for 12 h in medium 199 with 10-100 micrograms [125I]LDL and LDL uptake (i.e. binding and internalization) determined by Scatchard analysis. In intact baboons and animals that had undergone fetectomy, syncytiotrophoblasts predominated and formed a continuous surface covering of the placental villi. Moreover, placental cells of intact and fetectomized baboons isolated on 50% Percoll consisted primarily of syncytiotrophoblasts, as evidenced by their immunohistochemical reaction with antisera against placental lactogen and pregnancy-specific-beta 1-glycoprotein. Serum estradiol in untreated baboons increased with advancing gestation and mean (+/- SE) concentrations were 1.29 +/- 0.04 ng/ml on days 101-160 of gestation. Placentas remained in situ and viable after fetectomy, but serum estradiol decreased to 0.24 +/- 0.02 ng/ml, or 19% of normal (P less than 0.01). Androstenedione restored serum estradiol after fetectomy to a mean of 0.69 +/- 0.03 ng/ml on days 101-160, or 53% of normal. Specific LDL uptake (nanograms per microgram protein) by placental cells after fetectomy alone (3.2 +/- 0.4) was 22% (P less than 0.001) of controls (14.4 +/- 1.2). Androstenedione increased (P less than 0.005) LDL uptake after fetectomy to a value (8.8 +/- 1.2) that was 61% of normal. LDL degradation, which depends on uptake, was 59 +/- 1% of normal after fetectomy and restored with androstenedione treatment to 94 +/- 2% of normal. Apparent dissociation constants (microgram/ml) for LDL uptake were similar after fetectomy (0.38), and fetectomy and androstenedione treatment (0.41), but lower (P less than 0.01) than in intact animals (0.80).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Single cell levels of LHRH mRNA were determined by quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry using an 35S-labeled synthetic 48-base oligodeoxynucleotide probe and quantitative autoradiography. Nine days postcastration, a 10.4-fold increase in mean plasma LH titers was observed which was associated with significantly increased LHRH mRNA in rostral hypothalamic neuronal cell bodies. Both increases were blocked in rats rendered hyperprolactinemic by the presence of the 7315a PRL-secreting pituitary tumor. The location and number of neurons expressing LHRH mRNA were unchanged, indicating that these differences were attributable to amounts of mRNA expressed per neuron. Experimental differences occurred in LHRH perikarya situated throughout the rostral hypothalamus from the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis to the caudal extent of the medial preoptic nucleus. These results suggest that gonadal steroids and PRL are involved, either directly or indirectly, in regulating the biosynthesis of LHRH in the rostral hypothalamus.\r"

  ".W": "Bovine parathyroid organoids were maintained for up to 12 days of culture in the presence or absence of insulin. Insulin-treated organoids secreted more PTH and secretory protein-I (SP-I) than did untreated organoids at both 1.4 and 1.8 mM Ca, concentrations chosen to promote partially elevated and suppressed secretion rates, respectively. The insulin effect was dose dependent and reversible. To determine whether insulin might increase secretion by reducing degradation of cellular PTH, its effects on several parameters related to degradative processes were examined. Compared to control cultures maintained at either 1.4 or 1.8 mM Ca, insulin did not induce changes in the relative levels of intact hormone and COOH-terminal peptide fragments secreted into culture medium, nor did it decrease the total cellular levels of three lysosomal enzymes or mute the effects of 3-methyladenine (an agent that decreases formation of autophagosomes) to increase PTH secretion. Thus, insulin did not appear to increase PTH secretion by reducing the latter's cellular degradation. Synthesis of total proteins and of the secreted proteins SP-I and PTH was examined using short incubations of control and insulin-treated organoids with [3H] leucine. Incorporation of 3H into total acid-precipitable proteins was not elevated in insulin-treated organoids; that into PTH/pro-PTH and SP-I, however, was significantly greater in insulin-treated than in control organoids. The results suggested that the insulin-mediated increase in PTH and SP-I secretion is largely due to its regulation of PTH and SP-I biosynthesis.\r"

  ".U": "91099187\r", 
  ".W": "Antibodies to neuropeptides or hormones are frequently used in passive immunization studies to unravel their physiological role in signal transfer. In such in vivo experiments antibodies are considered to bind and thereby to biologically inactivate the endogenous substance during its journey from its site of secretion to its site of action (signalling time). However, little is known about the mechanism of action and characteristics of antibodies that determine such biological activity. Since the signalling time in neuronal and hormonal communication is short, the kinetics of antibody binding is an important feature. Here, we present a theoretical framework to describe antibody binding kinetics which can contribute to the design of passive immunization protocols. The specific effects of variation in antibody concentration, dissociation constant, and on-rate constant on these binding kinetics are demonstrated. Simple methods are described to determine these parameters, which may guide the selection of antibodies for passive immunization studies. When time is limited, the on-rate constant and the local antibody concentration are the most important determinants. Several points are illustrated for CRF signal transfer in the rat. CRF signalling time in the hypothalamo-pituitary complex, as established from dye transport experiments, was 3-7 sec. Based on parameters measured for a rat monoclonal antibody to CRF (PFU 83), we computed that half-maximal and full blockades of ether-induced ACTH secretion were associated with approximately 85% and more than 99% binding of CRF, respectively. From the theoretical framework presented in this study we conclude that, in general, the kinetics of antigen binding are sufficiently fast for antibodies to interfere with hormonal and probably nonsynaptic neuronal signal transfer. However, interference with fast signalling processes (less than 10 msec), which may occur in the brain, is unlikely.\r"

In addition to the well known activation of the sympathoadrenomedullary system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and-thyroid axes, cold exposure was followed by a rapid and sustained increase of 5'-MA in the hypothalamus, and a byphasic course of activation in the adrenal gland in control rats. The adrenal rapid activation (30 min) corresponded to the medulla and the slower activation (120 min) to the cortex. Both, the basal adrenal 5'-MA and the response to cold in adrenal and hypothalamus were 2-fold higher in hypophysectomized rats compared to control. The time course of enzyme activation in these structures suggests that: 1) organ-specific increases in 5'-MA may be associated to a simultaneous rise in their metabolic and/or functional activity, 2) the triggering mechanisms involves an immediate sympathetic signal activating the hypothalamic-adrenal medulla response and a pituitary signal eliciting a slower adrenocortical response, and 3) the compensatory sympathetic hyperactivity after panhypopituitarism contribute to enhance both the adrenal enzyme basal activity and the hypothalamic and adrenal hyperresponse to cold stress.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence suggests that insulin-like growth factors-I and -II (IGF-I and II) play a role in regulating fetal growth and development. In the fetus, IGF-I and -II are complexed with two specific binding proteins (IGFBP-1 and -2), which are thought to modulate the actions of the IGFs in target tissues. We examined regulation of the genes for IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-2 in fetal rat liver in an experimental model for intrauterine growth retardation caused by maternal fasting on days 17-21 of gestation. The mean weight of fetuses from the fasted dams was 27-32% lower than the mean weight of fetuses from the fed dams. The concentration of immunoreactive IGF-I was decreased by 71% in serum of fetuses from the fasting dams. The concentration of immunoreactive IGF-II was slightly decreased (by 12%) in serum of fetuses from the fasting dams, whereas the concentration of immunoreactive pro-IGF-II E-domain peptide was decreased by 31%. The abundance of hepatic IGF-I mRNA was decreased by 55% in fetuses from the fasting dams. In contrast, the abundance of IGF-II mRNA in fetal liver was not significantly decreased by maternal fasting. Maternal fasting caused a 2-fold increase in the abundance of IGFBP-1 mRNA in fetal liver, whereas it did not change the abundance of IGFBP-2 mRNA. The induction of IGFBP-1 mRNA in liver of the growth-retarded fetuses is similar to the induction that occurs in liver of fasting adults, while the lack of regulation of IGFBP-2 mRNA differs from the strong induction of IGFBP-2 mRNA that occurs in liver of fasting adults. In summary, these results indicate that maternal fasting causes a decrease in fetal IGF-I gene expression, a decrease in fetal serum IGF-I, and a slight decrease in fetal serum IGF-II and pro-IGF-II E-domain peptide concentrations. Maternal fasting also causes an increase in fetal IGFBP-1 gene expression. Changes in fetal insulin and glucose may be related to changes in expression of the IGF-I and IGFBP-1 genes in the growth-retarded fetuses. The decreased expression of IGF-I and -II and increased expression of the IGFBP-1 gene may contribute to the fetal growth retardation observed in this model system.\r"

The addition of rat interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) or rat IL-2 increased corticosterone levels in the medium in a concentration-dependent manner during 24 h of incubation. The minimum, half-maximum, and maximum effective concentrations of both rat IL-1 alpha and rat IL-2 were almost same (approximately 3, 10, and 100 U/ml, respectively). After a latent period, the effect became apparent after 12 h of incubation. Human IL-1 beta and human IL-6 also showed a stimulatory effect on corticosterone production, whereas human IL-2 was inactive in this system. To clarify the cellular mechanism of these stimulatory effects, we measured the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and cAMP in the cells and media as well as the corticosterone levels. Corticosterone production stimulated by IL-1 alpha or IL-2 was accompanied by intracellular and extracellular cAMP and PGE2 accumulation. Although the stimulation of both cAMP and corticosterone was observed only after 12 h of incubation, PGE2 levels increased during the first 4 h of incubation. Corticosterone, cAMP, and PGE2 production stimulated by ILs was almost completely blocked by the addition of 0.1 mM aspirin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Lipoxygenase inhibitors, i.e. AA-861, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetrynoic acid, did not abolish corticosterone production stimulated by ILs. Submaximal doses of IL-1 alpha and IL-2 synergistically stimulated PGE2 production, but did not have even additional effects on cAMP and corticosterone levels. On the other hand, submaximal doses of ACTH, which did not significantly affect PGE2 levels, acted synergistically with IL to increase cAMP and corticosterone levels in these cells. These results indicate that 1) IL-1 alpha and IL-2 directly stimulate glucocorticoid synthesis in a dose- and time-dependent manner; 2) a half-maximum effective concentration of ACTH acts synergistically with IL in stimulating glucocorticoidogenesis; 3) the stimulatory process initially requires PGs, followed by the activation of the adenylate cyclase system; 4) although the profiles of steroidogenic action of IL-1 alpha and IL-2 are quite similar, they may exert their effects through different mechanisms in their early steps of PGE2 production; and 5) the low effective concentrations of both cytokines suggest possible physiological or pathophysiological roles of circulating cytokines in the glucocorticoidogenesis under certain conditions.\r"

Estradiol and other antiestrogens such as BPEA (-2-(4-tert-butyl-phenoxy) ethyl diethylamine hydrochloride, LY117018, and LY 156758 do not have this effect. The triphenylethylene antiestrogens bind to the membrane-associated antiestrogen binding sites (AEBS). Effectiveness of binding to the AEBS parallels the effectiveness of inhibition of the lactogen binding. The effect is selective in that binding of epidermal growth factor and insulin to these same membranes is unaffected by the antiestrogens. Binding of PRL to membranes prepared from the livers of the lactating mice is also unaffected. Both the PRL receptor and AEBS are primarily localized to the microsomal membrane fraction of cells. Maximal inhibition of PRL binding by TAM is observed in the light microsomes that contain plasma membranes. In addition to inhibition of PRL binding, TAM also prevents the PRL-induced accumulation of caseins by cultured mouse mammary explants. Thus it appears that the triphenylethylene antiestrogens, acting through the AEBS, act as antilactogens in the normal mammary gland.\r"

At 8 weeks of age the mammary gland is morphologically and functionally comparable to that normally reached after 14-15 days of gestation. Precocious development correlated with local expression of hGH in mammary gland. Organ culture in the presence of different lactogenic hormones revealed that insulin and hydrocortisone are sufficient to maintain transcription of the WAP gene in transgenic mammary gland. In contrast, WAP transcription in normal gland required either hGH or PRL in addition to insulin and hydrocortisone. However, the effect of hGH on mammary differentiation does not appear to be solely mediated through an interaction with PRL receptors, since PRL, when added to cultured mammary tissues, did not elicit an equivalent response.\r"

To determine which of the three might represent the progesterone-binding protein, steroid photoaffinity labeling was performed which resulted in the specific and exclusive labeling of a 50K band. Thus, the adrenocortical nuclear progesterone-binding protein appears to be distinct from the classical progesterone receptor not only biochemically, but also on the basis of molecular size. To test whether the adrenocortical nuclear progesterone-binding protein can be hormonally stimulated, guinea pigs were treated with ACTH. The chronic administration of ACTH caused a 4- to 6-fold increase in the specific progesterone binding capacity without a change in the binding affinity. There appeared to be no significant difference in nuclear progesterone binding between the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis. This finding suggests a mediating role for the progesterone-binding protein in ACTH action. In addition, the nuclear progesterone-binding protein bound to nonspecific DNA sequences, further suggesting a possible transcriptional regulatory role.\r"

  ".W": "Biochemical studies of K+ efflux from rat pinealocytes revealed for the first time that norepinephrine (NE) increases 86Rb+ and 42K+ efflux. The effects of NE depend upon concurrent activation of both alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors. This effect is mediated by cAMP and Ca2+, which appear to act in conjunction to control K+ efflux; studies with charybdotoxin and tetraethylammonium indicate that a Ca2(+)-sensitive K+ channel (K(Ca] appears to be involved. Patch clamp studies identified a large conductance (approximately 100 psec) K+ channel. This study also revealed for the first time that NE treatment increases the fraction of time that this channel was open. Studies of inside-out pineal membrane patches indicated that increasing Ca2+ at the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane increased the frequency of channel opening, as is typical of K(Ca) channels in this type of preparation. Outward K+ currents were almost completely blocked by tetraethylammonium (10 mM) and scorpion venom (L. quinquestriatum; 100 ng/ml). Cell-attached studies confirm that the effects of NE are mediated by intracellular second messengers. These investigations suggest that NE elevates K+ flux, probably through a large conductance K(Ca) channel, that NE acts through alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors, and that Ca2+ and cAMP act together through a biochemical \"AND\" gate to mediate the effects of receptor activation. Activation of this K(Ca) channel would have a hyperpolarizing influence and might contribute to the adrenergic hyperpolarization of pinealocytes.\r"

We used a purified preparation of normal rat somatotrophs and examined the changes in 45Ca uptake, [Ca2+]i measured with indo-1, intracellular cAMP, and GH release induced by GRF. GRF stimulated a concentration-related biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i. Both the GRF-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i and GH release were blocked by incubation in low Ca2+ medium and by the organic Ca2+ antagonists nifedipine and diltiazem. The measurement of 45Ca uptake, in both steady state and nonsteady state conditions, demonstrated directly that GRF stimulates Ca2+ influx into somatotrophs. These data demonstrate that the GRF-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i is dependent on Ca2+ influx. Redistribution of intracellularly stored Ca2+ could not be detected, even though intracellular Ca2+ stores were present. Therefore, the increase is due to Ca2+ influx, and the biphasic nature of the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by GRF is due to a difference in the rate of activation of Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ removal from the cytosol.\r"

However, there is no definitive report showing that FGF exists in the thyroid. In this report, we describe heparin binding endothelial cell growth factor activity in porcine thyroids. The extract from normal adult porcine thyroids was loaded onto a heparin-sepharose affinity column. The mitogenic activity on endothelial cells was found to elute from the column with 0.9 M-2.0 M NaCl. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and an immunoblotting of bioactive fractions showed the basic FGF immunoreactivity in a double band with a molecular weight of 18K and 20K. These results strongly imply that the adult porcine thyroid-derived heparin binding endothelial cell growth factor may be authentic basic FGF and one of its high molecular weight forms. In support of this conclusion, basic FGF mRNA was detected in poly A+ RNA isolated from cultured porcine thyroid cells. On the other hand, recombinant human basic FGF at the concentration of 0.1-10 ng/ml increased the incorporation of 3H-thymidine into FRTL-5 cells and porcine thyroid follicular cells in culture. The stimulatory effects were also observed when the biologically active fractions of heparin-sepharose column of the thyroid extract were added to the culture. In addition, both recombinant human basic FGF at 10 ng/ml and heparin binding fractions from porcine thyroids inhibited TSH-induced iodide uptake by porcine thyroid cells in culture. These results suggest that basic FGF may be one of the important local modulators of thyroid function, cell growth, and angiogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "This study was carried out to investigate the role of Ca2+ in the somatostatin (SRIF)-induced inhibition of GH release. We examined the effect of SRIF on basal and GH-releasing factor (GRF)-induced increases in Ca2+ influx and free intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in normal somatotrophs and examined the effect of SRIF on 45Ca uptake, [Ca2+]i measured with indo-1, and GH release. SRIF inhibited basal and GRF-induced GH release concurrently with a reduction in steady state 45Ca uptake. In nonsteady state experiments, SRIF also decreased basal 45Ca uptake. SRIF decreased baseline [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited the GRF-induced biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i, but in a differential fashion. Low concentrations of SRIF abolished the peak (first phase) without affecting the plateau (second phase), while at high concentrations, both phases were inhibited. SRIF blocked the GRF-induced increase in [Ca2+]i regardless of whether it was applied before or during GRF stimulation. These data indicate that the SRIF-dependent decrease in 45Ca uptake is due to a decrease in Ca2+ influx. This is further supported by the fact that the GRF-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i, which is dependent on Ca2+ influx, is blocked by SRIF. The reported ability of SRIF to reduce the activation rate of Ca2+ currents, decrease Ca2+ conductance, and hyperpolarize the cell would explain the differential effect of SRIF on the GRF-induced [Ca2+]i increase. The inhibitory effect of SRIF on GH release would then be dependent on the ability of SRIF to decrease, or prevent, an increase in [Ca2+]i.\r"

  ".W": "GH-releasing factor (GRF)-stimulated GH release is dependent on a biphasic increase in free intracellular Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i), resulting from an influx of Ca2+ into somatotrophs, while the inhibitory action of somatostatin (SRIF) on basal and GRF-induced GH release results from its ability to lower [Ca2+]i by inhibiting Ca2+ influx. This study was carried out to investigate the mechanism by which GRF and SRIF regulate [Ca2+]i to control GH release. The roles of ion channels, cAMP-dependent processes, and protein kinase-C (PKC) were investigated by measuring changes in [Ca2+]i, 45Ca influx, and GH release when purified rat somatotrophs were exposed to high K+, cAMP analogs, prostaglandin E2, as well as the PKC activators 1,2-dioctanoyl-glycerol and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. High K+ depolarization produced a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+]i, while cAMP and prostaglandin E2 led to a sustained elevated [Ca2+]i. PKC activators produced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i, followed by a decrease to below baseline. All secretagogues tested raised [Ca2+]i by stimulating Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCC), since the increases in [Ca2+]i were blocked by incubation in Ca2(+)-free medium and by the dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonist nifedipine. SRIF lowered [Ca2+]i by blocking the Ca2+ influx stimulated by all of these GH secretagogues except high K+. These results are consistent with the model in which GRF initiates its action by increasing Na+ conductance to depolarize the somatotroph via cAMP. This depolarization would stimulate Ca2+ influx through VSCC, which would result in the first phase of the GRF-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i. This increase in [Ca2+]i would stimulate Ca2+ removal from the cytosol by activating Ca-ATPase via Ca-calmodulin and/or PKC. This would result in the lowering of [Ca2+]i to the plateau level of the second phase of the GRF response. SRIF prevents the GRF-induced increase in [Ca2+]i by increasing K+ conductance and, thus, hyperpolarizing the cell. Hyperpolarization would close VSCC, leading to a decrease in Ca2+ influx, with a subsequent drop in [Ca2+]i.\r"

Induction of 21-hydroxylase mRNA and enzyme activity was assessed after cultures were incubated with cAMP analogs. Basal 21-hydroxylase mRNA and enzyme activities were high; cAMP addition resulted in some increase in the level of mRNA, but little increase in enzyme activity. When cultures were made mitotically quiescent by using a higher starting cell density or by allowing cells to grow for a longer period before incubation with cAMP, basal mRNA and enzyme activity were low and increased greatly in response to cAMP. Other agents that raise intracellular cAMP (ACTH, prostaglandin E1, cholera toxin, and forskolin) increased 21-hydroxylase mRNA in quiescent cultures. As previously demonstrated for 11 beta-hydroxylase,21-hydroxylase mRNA induction by cholera toxin or cAMP analogs was dependent on the presence of insulin-like growth factor-I or insulin in the culture medium. When cultures were not quiescent, 21-hydroxylase mRNA and enzyme activity were highly variable, but characterized by 1) high basal levels, 2) small increases or actual decreases in response to cAMP, and 3) variable increases in response to TPA, not observed in quiescent cultures. This last effect was observed within a very narrow range of TPA concentrations (0.3-3 nM); at higher concentrations 21-hydroxylase activity decreased to values below those in the control culture. The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine at 1-5 nM inhibited basal 21-hydroxylase enzyme activity in nonquiescent cultures by up to 80%. The probable existence of controlling factors for 21-hydroxylase expression other than cAMP suggests that the regulation of this gene differs substantially from that of the other steroid hydroxylases.\r"

  ".W": "The subcellular origin of membranes from rat skeletal muscle that contain insulin-responsive glucose transporters was investigated. Rat skeletal muscle membranes were prepared by isopycnic centrifugation in sucrose gradients. In vivo insulin treatment increased the content of GLUT-4 glucose transporters in the 25% sucrose fraction (enriched in the plasma membrane marker 5'-nucleotidase) and decreased it in the 35% sucrose fraction (devoid of plasma membrane markers). The possibility of endothelial cell membrane contamination in these fractions was investigated using a mouse monoclonal antibody, MRC OX-43, raised against a cell surface protein specific to rat vascular endothelium. MRC OX-43 did not react with any of the muscle membrane fractions, but did recognize a protein of around 100 kDa in extracts of human endothelial cells and rat aorta. An antibody to the dihydropyridine receptor of skeletal muscle, IIC12, was used to determine the presence of transverse tubules in these fractions. IIC12 reacted positively with a 180-kDa protein in purified rat transverse tubules. In contrast, this antibody did not cross-react with the 25% or 35% sucrose fractions. The 25% sucrose fraction was devoid of calsequestrin and ryanodine receptor, cisternal sarcoplasmic reticulum markers. However, small amounts of these proteins were detected in the 35% sucrose fraction. The results suggest that the 25% sucrose fraction represents plasma membranes, while the 35% sucrose fraction is an insulin-sensitive intracellular fraction that contains, but is not enriched in, sarcoplasmic reticulum cisternae. The results further show that insulin-induced recruitment of GLUT-4 transporters in skeletal muscles can be demonstrated independently of GLUT-4 recruitment in endothelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "The submaxillary gland, a heterogeneous tissue composed essentially of two functionally distinct cell types (tubular epithelial and acinar), offers an interesting system in which to study the mechanisms of steroid-dependent growth and differentiation. One cell type, the granular convoluted tubular (GCT) cell, secretes a large number of physiologically important polypeptides, including epidermal and nerve growth factors. Two steroids, androgens and glucocorticoids, greatly influence the growth, differentiation, and secretory activity of GCT cells. Because glucocorticoids can partially mimic or potentiate androgen effects, it has been thought that glucocorticoids act via androgen receptors. Since the presence of glucocorticoid receptors is a prerequisite for glucocorticoid action, we have investigated the presence and cellular distribution of glucocorticoid receptors within the rat submaxillary gland. Binding experiments using [3H]dexamethasone revealed the presence of high affinity binding sites in rat submaxillary tissue homogenates. Most of these sites were specifically competed by dexamethasone, corticosterone, and a pure glucocorticoid agonist RU 28362. Neither testosterone nor dihydrotestosterone competed for glucocorticoid binding. The cellular distribution of glucocorticoid receptors within the submaxillary gland was investigated by immunocytochemistry, using two highly specific glucocorticoid receptor antibodies. The receptor was localized in the GCT cells, but not in the acinar cells of rat and mouse submaxillary tissue sections. In GCT cells, the glucocorticoid receptor colocalized with several secretory polypeptides, including epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, alpha 2u-globulin, and atrial natriuretic factor. These data suggest that the submaxillary gland is a target for glucocorticoid action and that at least part of the glucocorticoid effects on this tissue are mediated by bona fide glucocorticoid receptors.\r"

To clarify the molecular basis of this suppression, we investigated the effect of recombinant TNF-alpha (rTNF-alpha) on the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for adrenal cytochrome P450 oxidases, P450scc (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme/20.22-desmolase), P450c11 (11 beta-hydroxylase/18-hydroxylase/18-methyl oxidase), P450c17 (17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase), and P450c21 (21-hydroxylase). Northern and dot blot experiments showed that 36 h incubation of primary cultures of human fetal adrenals with ACTH (200 ng/ml) increased the levels of all P450 enzymes severalfold. Preincubation of the cultures with rTNF-alpha at concentrations ranging from 0.1-100 ng/ml produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the ACTH-induced accumulation of all P450 mRNAs. The decrease in the expression of genes for steroidogenic enzymes was accompanied by a similar decrease in the production of cortisol but not in that of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate nor androstenedione. Neither the basal expression of P450 enzymes nor the basal secretion of the steroids was significantly altered by 10 ng/ml of rTNF-alpha. rTNF-alpha did not affect the level of actin mRNA, the cell viability, nor the cell number. All the effects brought about by rTNF-alpha could be neutralized by addition of monoclonal anti-TNF-alpha antibody. These results show that TNF-alpha suppresses the synthesis of cortisol and shifts the steroid secretory pattern towards androgen production at least partly by suppressing the accumulation of mRNAs for adrenal cytochrome P450 oxidases.\r"

Using [125I-Tyr10] hGRF (1-44)NH2 as radioligand, we performed cold saturation studies in 2, 8, 14 and 18-month-old Sprague-Dawley male rat pituitary homogenates. In young rats (2 months), analysis by Ligand revealed the presence of two distinct classes of binding sites (KDs = 0.86 +/- 0.15 and 400 +/- 210 nM; BMAXS = 269 +/- 47 fmol and 42 +/- 19 pmol/mg protein, respectively). In 8 and 14-month old rats, there was a concomitant decrease in capacity of the high affinity class of sites (P less than 0.01) and increase in capacity of the low affinity class of sites (P less than 0.05). In parallel, a transient increase in affinity of the high affinity class of sites was observed in 14-month-old rats (P less than 0.05). In old rats (18 months), the data were no longer statistically analyzed with a two site-model, indicating a severe blunting of the high affinity sites. As the GRF-induced GH secretion is still not diminished at 8 month of age in these animals, our results indicate: 1) that alterations of GRF binding sites precede the GH impairment, thus probably participate in the initiating of this phenomenon and 2) that the biological actions of GRF on GH secretion are likely mediated by the high affinity class of sites.\r"

We observed a 30-45% increase in DAG in rat gastrocnemius and diaphragm muscles, 5-15 min after intramuscular or intravenous injections of 1-3 U of insulin per rat, doses which would be expected to activate insulin receptors more fully. The effects on DAG were similar whether or not hypoglycemia was prevented by co-injection of glucose.\r"

  ".W": "We have used the technique which we have developed for collecting pituitary venous blood from conscious, undisturbed horses to study the effect of acute vigorous exercise on the secretion of CRF, arginine vasopressin (AVP) and ACTH. Pituitary venous (pit) blood was collected every 1-5 min from nine trained racehorses at rest in the stable. The horses then trotted quietly for 10 min, after which they galloped as fast as possible for 4-6 min, before returning to the stable where sampling continued. In Exp 1 (n = 5) no blood samples were taken during exercise, whereas in Exp 2 (n = 4), pit blood was collected every 30 sec during exercise. Immediately after exercise, significant elevations in heart rate (P less than 0.001), body temperature (P less than 0.01) and hematocrit (P less than 0.001) were observed as compared with preexercise values. Jugular cortisol levels were higher after exercise (301.9 +/- 35.2 nmol/liter; mean +/- SEM) than before (187.3 +/- 34.8; P less than 0.01; n = 9). Likewise, jugular AVP levels increased with exercise (before, 0.65 +/- 0.11 pmol/liter; after 3.2 +/- 0.6; P less than 0.01; n = 6), whereas jugular CRF was not altered by exercise (before, 0.38 +/- 0.08 pmol/liter; after, 0.93 +/- 0.31; n = 6; NS). In Exp 1, no significant changes in pit ACTH, AVP, or CRF were observed after exercise. However in Exp 2 when pit blood was sampled during exercise all horses showed an immediate and dramatic rise in ACTH (P less than 0.01) and AVP (P less than 0.005) secretion which peaked during galloping with mean fractional changes above resting levels of 23.6 +/- 9.9 for ACTH and 51.7 +/- 24.0 for AVP. After exercise pit AVP levels were not different from resting, whereas ACTH remained elevated (11.4 +/- 6.9-fold above resting levels). By contrast, pit CRF levels were not altered by exercise. In both experiments together, pit AVP and ACTH concentrations were correlated in eight of the nine horses, whereas pit CRF and ACTH concentrations were positively correlated in only one of seven horses. We conclude that acute exercise causes a transient increase in ACTH secretion which occurs synchronously with an increase in AVP secretion. CRF does not appear to play a major role in mediating the initial ACTH response to exercise.\r"

  ".W": "Using the method of Western ligand blot, we have found that the major form of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGF-BP) secreted by rat osteoblastic-like cells in culture is a 31-kDa protein that is immunologically identical to BP-2, the binding protein originally identified in conditioned medium of Buffalo rat liver cells (BRL-3A). Two minor forms of IGF-BPs with apparent mol wt of 24 kDa (BP-24) and 42 kDa (BP-42) have also been identified. The amount of IGF-BPs in serum-free conditioned medium increased 3-fold on day 3 compared to the day 1 level. We also studied the modulation of IGF-BPs by dexamethasone (DEX), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D3], and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). DEX coordinately reduced the level of IGF-BPs in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which resulted in less than 10% of the BP-2 remaining at 100 nM. In contrast, 1,25-(OH)2D3 at 100 nM enhanced the amount of BP-2 by 1-fold. In combined treatments, 1,25-(OH)2D3 at 10 nM was unable to antagonize the inhibitory effect of DEX in the dose range of 1-10 nM. IGF-I, at 1 and 10 nM, proved to be a potent stimulator of all IGF-BPs, and at 10 nM, it completely reversed the inhibition by 100 nM DEX. Although the roles of IGF-BPs have not been clearly defined in bone cells, they are capable of modulating the biological actions of IGFs in other cell culture systems. Modulation of the IGF-BP level by DEX, 1,25-(OH)2D3, and IGF-I suggests important roles for these binding proteins in altering IGF-I action in rat osteoblast-like cell cultures.\r"

  ".U": "91099211\r", 
  ".W": "The fluorine introduced analog of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3], 26,26,26,27,27,27-hexafluoro-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [26,27-F6-1,25-(OH)2D3] is 5-10 times more potent than 1,25-(OH)2D3 in vitamin D-deficient rats and chicks. In this study we established cultures of human bone cells in order to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the higher activity of this compound. The effects of 26,27-F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 and 26,26,26,27,27,27-hexafluoro-1,23(S),25-trihydroxyvitamin D3[26,27-F6-1,23(S),25-(OH)3D3], the postulated main metabolite of 26,27-F6-1,25-(OH)2D3, were assessed by the response of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. 26,27-F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 increased ALP activity in a dose-related fashion, from a concentration of 10(-11) M and caused a 3-fold elevation at a concentration of 10(-9) M. To achieve the same stimulating effect on ALP activity, the required dose of 26,27-F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 was 100 times less than that of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Analysis of the receptors of these cells revealed that they have specific receptors for 1,25-(OH)2D3, which have a dissociation constant of 0.9 x 10(-10) M. The competitive binding assays of 26,27-F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 on these receptors showed that binding ability of 26,27-F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 is almost the same as that of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Therefore, receptor binding affinity does not account for the higher potency of 26,27-F6-1,25-(OH)2D3. The trihydroxylated compound, 26,27-F6-1,23(S),25-(OH)3D3 revealed almost the same stimulatory activity on ALP activity in these cells. The most likely explanation for the higher activity of 26,27-F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 than 1,25-(OH)2D3 is that 26,27-F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 is metabolized to 26,27-F6-1,23(S),25-(OH)3D3, which has almost the same activity as 26,27-F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 in target tissues, whereas 1,25-(OH)2D3 is degraded to less active metabolites such as 1,24,25-(OH)3D3.\r"

  ".W": "The present study examined the number and distribution of progestin receptor cells in the 8-day-old male and female cortex and compared cortical labeling with that in the preoptic area and central hypothalamus. Eight-day postnatal mice (four males and four females), treated with estradiol, were each sc injected with 0.32 micrograms/100 g BW [125I]progestin (SA, 2200 Ci/mM). Brains were frozen 2 h after injection of [125I]progestin, sectioned, and processed for thaw-mount autoradiography. Cells with a nuclear concentration of radioactivity were localized in lamina VI of the lateral cortical regions of the male and female brain, while only a few cortical cells were seen in laminae II, III, and V of the suprarhinal, lateral, and cingulate/paracingulate regions. Comparison of the number of labeled cells revealed that the female cortex contained significantly more labeled cells than the male at three of the four levels investigated. Similarly, the number of target cells was higher in the female medial preoptic nucleus, but not in the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, while the distributions of labeled cells in the male and female preoptic/hypothalamic regions were comparable. Injection of unlabeled progesterone or R5020 1 h before [125I]progestin reduced the nuclear concentration of radioactivity in all target regions and verified the specificity of [125I]progestin for the progestin receptor. The results of these studies indicate that mouse 8-day-old cortex and preoptic area in the female animal have more progestin receptor cells than those in the male and demonstrate that progestin receptor cells are localized in a region of the cortex known to contain few estrogen target cells. These results further suggest that a sexual dimorphism in progestin cell number may result in a differential effect of progestin on the cortex and preoptic area of the mouse, perhaps establishing a dimorphism in development and function.\r"

  ".W": "Calpactins are members of the annexin family of structurally related Ca2(+)-dependent membrane binding proteins. Recent studies suggest a role for calpactins in the membrane fusion event of exocytosis. We show in this work that two members of the annexin family which are immunologically related to calpactin I (p36, annexin II) and calpactin II (p35, annexin I) are present in anterior pituitary cells. When sheep adenohypophyseal cells are disrupted in the absence of a Ca2+ chelator, immunoreactive calpactins associate with the crude vesicle fraction. Further purification of this subcellular fraction by sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed a differential distribution: calpactin I was associated with secretory granule membranes and with plasma membranes, whereas calpactin II was found primarily with the plasma membrane fraction. Consistent with the Ca2+ and phospholipid binding properties of the calpactins, extraction of these proteins from the pituitary membranous fractions required sequential treatment with a detergent, octylglucoside, in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ followed by solubilization with EGTA. Calpactins contain sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C, and in this study we found phosphoprotein substrates for protein kinase C associated with secretory granule and plasma membranes which could be immunoprecipitated with calpactin antisera. In summary, the characteristics in anterior pituitary secretory cells of these two members of the annexin family lend support to the hypothesis that calpactins, potentially regulated by Ca2+ and by phosphorylation, may have a role in exocytosis.\r"

Two hundred seventy immature oocytes were aspirated from 23 ovaries removed for various gynecological indications from August 1988 to October 1989. The numbers of follicular oocytes collected from ovaries were compared by patients' ages and the stages of menstrual cycle. Immature oocytes in vitro were incubated with either mature follicular fluid (FF) or fetal cord serum (FCS). The maturation rate in the mature FF group was 55.8%, significantly higher than the 35.9% in the FCS group. In addition, mature FF group was shown to provide a significantly higher fertilization rate than the FCS group (81.0% versus 31.6%). More fertilized eggs developed into normal embryos in the nonstimulated cycle group than in stimulated cycles with routine treatment. Finally, five embryos were transferred to a woman with premature ovarian failure on day 18 of a steroid replacement cycle. She subsequently delivered healthy triplet girls. These results suggest that in vitro maturation of immature oocytes from unstimulated ovaries with mature follicular fluid could be used successfully in a donor oocyte program after in vitro fertilization.\r"

Of 37 transfers within days 17 to 19, 15 (40.5%) conceptions occurred. Twelve (32.4%) have reached viability. Of 11 patients transferred on days greater than or equal to 20, none conceived. Likewise, no pregnancies were achieved with 4 transfers on cycle day 16. Analysis of multiple embryo transfers within the suggested window of endometrial receptivity (days 17 to 19) revealed 14 of 24 (58.3%) to be conception cycles. considering only transfers with two or more embryos, at least one of which is of high quality (grades 1 to 2), yielded a 63.2% pregnancy rate. The results indicate a very high efficiency for in vitro fecundity provided optimal conditions are attained. The concepts leading to success in the ovum donation model should set the course for continued research toward improving results in other forms of assisted reproduction.\r"

Mathematical modeling was applied to the results to determine if there were degrees of improvement in uterine receptivity relative to various grades of embryo quality (\"E\" factor). Although the trial size was insufficient to enable the detection of significant improvements in the pregnancy rates that ranged from 27.5% for non-treatment to 41.2% for those receiving combined treatment, the birth rates were significantly better with luteal support (11.8% versus 29.4%). Similarly, the overall implantation rate just failed to reach statistical significance for luteal support, but the ongoing implantations were significantly better (3.6% versus 9.0%). Data modeling indicated that luteal support, particularly with the combined regimen, could improve the ongoing implantation rate by up to 2.5-fold when the E factor was poorest.\r"

The Young's syndrome patients had normal in vitro ciliary beat frequency (11.4 +/- 0.9 Hz), and 12 of the 23 had normal nasal mucociliary clearance (15.0 +/- 5.0 minutes). However, the remaining 11 had markedly abnormal nasal mucociliary clearance in vivo. In these patients, the deficiency of ciliary inner dynein arms did not appear to affect ciliary function in vitro but may under mucus loading lead to abnormal in vivo ciliary function. The consistent abnormalities shown in cilia and sperm tails, though apparently minor, constitute a common factor in both the reproductive and respiratory tracts which may, in combination with abnormalities in the in vivo environment, lead to the features of Young's syndrome.\r"

Rates of development in the presence of GF were inhibited significantly in some cases, and the cell numbers per blastocyst were identical in all groups. When compared with in vivo derived blastocysts, however, all in vitro cultured embryos had significantly less cells per embryo. These results suggest that GF supplementation of media for culture of early preimplantation embryos does not stimulate the rate of embryonic development in vitro.\r"

If it occurred as a result of freezing and thawing, it is more likely that this was at the first cleavage division rather than the second meiotic division because the embryos were frozen at the late pronuclear stage. Unfortunately, there were no karyotypic markers in the couple's chromosomes to time the nondisjunction.

We hypothesized that periovulatory immunomodulation of macrophage activation and inflammatory mediator production might be a more effective approach to this problem. In this experiment, heterologous transfer of activated peritoneal inflammatory cells within a syngeneic strain of mice was used as an in vivo model for the peritoneal inflammatory environment of the endometriosis patient. Intraperitoneal transfer of hyperactivated macrophages, but not basal state macrophages, significantly inhibited fertilization. This activity was reversed by periovulatory pentoxifylline treatment. Immunomodulation of peritoneal inflammatory cell hyperactivation with pentoxifylline may represent a new modality for the treatment of endometriosis-associated subfertility.\r"

Careful removal of the coronal cells, as well as stepwise removal of sucrose postpartial zona dissection, will facilitate this procedure and greatly reduce potential damage to the oocyte by pH, mechanical, or thermal injury. Micromanipulation has become a routine service offered in our program in cases where the likelihood of a poor IVF outcome is either known or suspected, and also serves as a replacement for simple reinsemination in cases of failed fertilization.\r"

A mean of 13.7 +/- 1.1 oocytes were obtained per aspiration resulting in the transfer of 4.5 +/- 0.2 pre-embryos to each recipient couple. Twenty-five of 47 ET resulted in pregnancy (53.2% per ET); 5 preclinical, and 20 clinical, of which 18 are ongoing or delivered. The overall implantation rate per individual transferred fresh pre-embryo was 21.1%.

Spontaneous ovulatory cycles were monitored with serial ultrasound examinations, and hCG 10,000 IU was given when the lead follicle was mature. Fourteen FF samples yielding fertilizable oocytes were compared with 13 FF samples from controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycles. Progesterone (P) was higher in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation than in unstimulated cycles (9.0 +/- 1.2 micrograms/mL versus 4.4 +/- 0.6 microgram/mL; mean +/- SEM), whereas estradiol (E2) was lower (0.8 +/- 0.1 microgram/mL versus 1.3 +/- 0.2 microgram/mL), resulting in a higher P:E2 ratio (15.5 +/- 3.3 versus 4.4 +/- 0.7). Androstenedione (A), testosterone (T), and T:E2 ratios were all higher in unstimulated than controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycles. We conclude that controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is associated with increased FF P, decreased FF E2, T, and A levels, and decreased T:E2 ratios, suggesting altered steroidogenesis and enhanced follicular aromatase activity.\r"

No reduction of motility was observed at any concentration tested. Similar results were observed with semen samples. Failure to alter sperm motility was evident in samples with either good or reduced motility. Also, CM penetration as measured after 90 minutes by Penetrak assay (Serono Diagnostics, Randolph, MA) was not impaired by a concentration as high as 5 mM bromocriptine. We conclude that bromocriptine in a wide range of concentrations does not inhibit sperm motility nor does it impair the capability of the sperm to penetrate the CM. These data support the therapeutic use of daily vaginal bromocriptine for the treatment of infertility.\r"

The reproductive performance of these patients was compared with 24 patients who underwent salpingectomy for their EP (historical control). Using life table analysis, the cumulative probability of intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) at 12 and 24 months was 45% and 45% after salpingotomy without tubal suturing and 21% and 47% after salpingotomy with tubal suturing, respectively. The cumulative probability of IUP after salpingectomy (21% and 26% at 12 and 24 months, respectively) was significantly lower than after salpingotomy with or without tubal suturing. There was no difference in the cumulative probability of EP after salpingotomy with or without tubal suturing, but it was significantly higher than after salpingectomy. In 18 women who subsequently underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy, no significant difference was found between the degree of adhesions after salpingotomy with or without tubal suturing. These findings suggest that IUP after conservative treatment is higher than after salpingectomy, but recurrent EP is also higher. Intrauterine pregnancy occurs earlier after salpingotomy without tubal suturing than after salpingotomy with tubal suturing. This might be because of rapid return of tubal function after healing by secondary intention.\r"

To this end, two groups of women, hyperandrogenic anovulatory (n = 4) and early follicular phase (n = 4) normally-cycling controls, were subjected to continuous blood withdrawal over 24 hours with a portable Cormed pump (Cormed Inc., Middleport, NY) and to exogenous stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropin.

  ".W": "A 7-year prospective study of a cohort of 1,458 normotensive adults from Utah pedigrees, screened from 1980 to 1985, was done to determine whether baseline levels of sodium-lithium countertransport were associated with an increased risk of future hypertension. Subsequent new hypertension (n = 39) was ascertained in 1989 from detailed follow-up medical questionnaires (67% response). Previous segregation analyses on a subset of these pedigree members who responded (n = 342) using family relationships in addition to countertransport levels have shown statistically inferred major gene segregation of sodium-lithium countertransport levels. In the normotensive adults inferred by segregation analysis to carry the recessive major gene for high sodium-lithium countertransport, new-onset hypertension occurred in 18.8% (3 of 16) compared with 3.7% (12 of 326) in the low sodium-lithium countertransport genotype group (relative risk, 4.6 [1.6, 13.9]; p = 0.03). However, an elevated baseline sodium-lithium countertransport level without genotype information from segregation analysis did not increase the risk of future hypertension in the complete cohort of adult pedigree members (relative risk, 1.02 [0.85, 1.22]). Adjustment for other risk factors reduced the relative risk to 0.90 (0.72, 1.11). We conclude that the presence of a major gene for sodium-lithium countertransport or another closely linked gene, rather than the actual level of sodium-lithium countertransport, may increase the risk of hypertension onset. High sodium-lithium countertransport levels do not increase the risk of future hypertension for individuals in whom only polygenic and environmental effects determine sodium-lithium countertransport level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We detected a novel vasoconstrictor in an arginine esterase fraction separated from fractions containing tonin and other esterases that were obtained from a rat submandibular gland extract. When tested on isolated rabbit aorta rings, the substance caused dose-related contractions that were slow in onset, long-lasting, and difficult to reverse by rinsing. The substance acts directly on vascular smooth muscle, since preincubation with plasma or intact endothelium is not required. The fact that the constrictor was destroyed by heat and incubation with pronase suggests that it is a protein. Molecular sieving indicates an estimated molecular weight of 24,000 Da. It has a neutral isoelectric point that is higher than the pI of tonin, from which it can be separated by anion exchange chromatography. A small amount of the vasoconstrictor was obtained by gel filtration and eluted from isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gels. The purified substance showed a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was a potent vasoconstrictor; an estimated concentration of 2.5 nM induced contraction of isolated rabbit aorta rings ranging from 15% to 40% of the maximum contraction obtained by 60 mM KCl. Contraction was completely blocked by 1 mM (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, a serine protease inhibitor. Contractile activity was not affected by hirudin, a thrombin inhibitor, but was completely inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor and blunted by aprotinin; thus it may be a trypsin-like serine protease. Purified vasoconstrictor preparation showed hydrolyzing activity on Pro-Phe-Arg-methyl-coumarin amide, a kallikrein substrate. We conclude that a novel vasoconstrictor serine protease is present in the rat submandibular gland.\r"

Apparent affinity of antagonists was evaluated in terms of pA2 on the rabbit jugular vein, the dog carotid and renal arteries, the hamster urinary bladder, the guinea pig ileum, the rat vas deferens, the guinea pig trachea, and the rabbit aorta, using bradykinin and desArg9-bradykinin as B2- and B1-receptor activators. Replacement of Pro7 of bradykinin with D-Phe leads to antagonism; substitution of Pro3 by Hyp and extension of the peptide chain at the N-terminal with a D-Arg residue improves the affinity of antagonists; acetylation of N-terminal amine function reduces residual agonistic activity; these changes, combined with the replacement of Phe8 by Leu as in Ac-D-Arg[Hyp3,D-Phe7,Leu8]-bradykinin, led to potent full B2-receptor antagonists. Affinity of antagonists differs markedly between highly sensitive (rabbit jugular vein, dog carotid and renal artery), moderately sensitive (hamster urinary bladder, guinea pig ileum, and rat vas deferens), and insensitive preparations (the guinea pig trachea) in which antagonists act as potent stimulants. High concentrations of antagonists block bradykinin completely in the rabbit jugular vein but not in the guinea pig ileum, suggesting that kinins stimulate the moderately sensitive tissues by two mechanisms, of which only one is blocked by antagonists. It thus appears that kinins act on various B2-receptor subtypes or by different action mechanisms.\r"

Individuals from the Framingham Heart Study were placed in normal and high-normal blood pressure categories and followed for 26 years for the development of hypertension. With hypertension defined as a diastolic blood pressure of 95 mm Hg or greater or the initiation of antihypertensive therapy, 23.6% of men and 36.2% of women with normal blood pressure developed hypertension compared with 54.2% of men and 60.6% of women with high-normal blood pressure. The relative risk for the development of hypertension associated with high-normal blood pressure was 2.25 for men (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-2.8; p less than 0.0001) and 1.89 for women (95% CI, 1.5-2.3; p less than 0.0001). The age-adjusted relative risks estimated by the proportional hazards model were 3.36 for men and 3.37 for women (p less than 0.001). Among those risk factors examined, baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure, Metropolitan relative weight, and change in weight over time were significant predictors of future hypertension in men and women whose initial blood pressure was normal. For men with high-normal blood pressure, systolic blood pressure and change in weight were identified as risk factors for future hypertension. These results indicate that the probability of individuals with blood pressure in the high-normal range developing hypertension is twofold to threefold higher than in those with normal blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intracerebroventricular infusion of 1.5 M NaCl significantly increased systolic blood pressure during the entire infusion period (+23 +/- 5 mm Hg on day 1 and +15 +/- 2 mm Hg on day 7, n = 10, mean +/- SEM). Blood pressure rose insignificantly in the 0.5 M NaCl group, whereas it remained at the baseline levels in the 0.15 M NaCl group. The increases in water intake (day 2), positive water balance (day 2), and negative sodium balance (day 3) were observed in the 1.5 M NaCl group. On day 7, the 1.5 M NaCl group showed hyponatremia and low plasma osmolality and had higher plasma norepinephrine but not vasopressin compared with the 0.15 M NaCl group. In another series of study, depressor response to intravenous hexamethonium (20 mg/kg) in the 1.5 M NaCl group was greater than that in the 0.15 M NaCl group on both day 1 and 7. The depressor response to d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-arginine vasopressin (10 micrograms/kg) in the 1.5 M NaCl group was greater on day 1 but not on day 7. These results indicate that sustained sodium stimulus on the central nervous system causes mild hypertension and alters water and sodium balance. The sympathetic nervous system but not vasopressin may play an important role in the chronic phase of central NaCl-induced hypertension.\r"

The borderline hypertensive rat is the first filial offspring of the spontaneously hypertensive rat and the Wistar-Kyoto rat and develops hypertension with increased dietary NaCl intake. The present investigation sought to determine whether the dietary NaCl intake-induced transition from the normotensive state of the Wistar-Kyoto parent to the hypertensive state of the spontaneously hypertensive parent in the borderline hypertensive rat was accompanied by a similar transition of the renal sympathetic nerve activity and excretory responses to volume expansion and environmental stress. Borderline hypertensive rats fed a 1% NaCl diet remained normotensive and exhibited renal sympathetic nerve activity and excretory responses to volume expansion and environmental stress that were similar to those of their Wistar-Kyoto parent. Borderline hypertensive rats fed an 8% NaCl diet developed hypertension and exhibited responses that were similar to those of their spontaneously hypertensive parent. Thus, the dietary NaCl intake-induced transition from the normotensive state of the Wistar-Kyoto parent to the hypertensive state of the spontaneously hypertensive parent in the borderline hypertensive rat was accompanied by a similar transition of the renal sympathetic nerve activity and excretory responses to volume expansion and environmental stress. The results suggest that increased dietary NaCl intake is able to induce or unmask the capabilities for these responses, which are genetically conveyed to the borderline hypertensive rat by the spontaneously hypertensive rat parent in latent forms.\r"

Enalapril maleate (25 mg.kg-1.day-1 in drinking water) was started at 4-5 weeks of age. At 7-9 weeks of age, the pressure-natriuresis relation was studied while the rats were under Inactin anesthesia 1 week after the right kidney and adrenal gland were removed. Neural and hormonal influences on the remaining kidney were fixed by surgical renal denervation, adrenalectomy, and infusion of a hormone cocktail (330 microliters.kg-1.min-1) containing high levels of aldosterone, arginine vasopressin, hydrocortisone, and norepinephrine dissolved in 0.9% NaCl containing 1% albumin. Changes in renal function resulting from alterations in renal artery pressure were compared between enalapril-treated and control rats. Mean arterial pressure (+/- SEM) under anesthesia was 118 +/- 5, 94 +/- 4, 175 +/- 3, and 124 +/- 2 mm Hg for control Wistar-Kyoto (n = 10), enalapril-treated Wistar-Kyoto (n = 10), control spontaneously hypertensive (n = 9), and enalapril-treated spontaneously hypertensive (n = 9) rats, respectively. When renal artery pressure was set at values above approximately 125 mm Hg, control spontaneously hypertensive rats excreted less sodium and water than control Wistar-Kyoto rats. Enalapril treatment resulted in a significant and similar shift to the left of the pressure-natriuresis relation in both strains of rats so that a lower renal artery pressure was required to excrete a similar amount of sodium when compared with their respective untreated controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study, we tested the response (cAMP accumulation) of cortical and outer medullary collecting tubules (OMCT) to vasopressin in two rat models that are resistant to deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-induced hypertension, the Wistar-Furth strain and NaCl-deficient rats. The blood pressure of normal outbred Wistar rats rose to hypertensive levels (systolic pressure more than 165 mm Hg) during a 5-week treatment with DOCA (10 mg/week) and 1% saline to drink. Significant hypertrophy of the heart and kidneys was also observed. Vasopressin (10(-8) M)-induced cAMP formation was enhanced 3.4-fold in the CCT (OMCT unchanged) of hypertensive rats compared with normotensive controls. Significant hypertrophy (as indexed by tubule diameter) of the CCT but not the OMCT was also observed in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Restriction of dietary NaCl (0.13% in chow, tap water to drink) completely prevented DOCA-induced hypertension, organ and CCT hypertrophy, and enhancement of vasopressin-stimulated cAMP formation in the CCT. In Wistar-Furth rats, DOCA-salt treatment did not alter blood pressure or cause significant organ hypertrophy. However, DOCA-salt treatment enhanced vasopressin-stimulated cAMP formation by 4.1-fold in CCT of Wistar-Furth rats, with significant tubular hypertrophy in the CCT but not the OMCT. We conclude that DOCA-induced hypertension and changes in CCT function are dependent on excess dietary NaCl.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Control measurements were made after holding pressure for 10-15 minutes at the level of arterial pressure recorded before each experiment. Baroreceptor threshold pressure (Pth) was higher in hypertensives (78 +/- 4 mm Hg) compared with normotensives (55 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), and nerve activity was less in hypertensives over a wide range of pressure. CS distensibility (sonomicrometers) was not significantly different in the two groups. After increasing holding pressure from control by 30 and 60 mm Hg for 10-15 minutes, the extent of baroreceptor resetting (delta Pth/delta holding pressure x 100%) in normotensives was 39 +/- 6% and 33 +/- 2%, respectively, but only 14 +/- 5% and 9 +/- 3% in hypertensives (p less than 0.05).

  ".W": "The primary abnormalities that contribute to the pathogenesis of human essential hypertension are unknown. The known genetic contribution to this disorder suggests the possible use of genetic linkage analysis to test whether specific candidate genes contribute to the pathogenesis of either essential hypertension or intermediate phenotypes. Among such phenotypes, elevated erythrocyte Na(+)-Li+ countertransport (SLC) is the best known, supporting major gene inheritance by pedigree analysis. Striking similarities between SLC and Na(+)-H+ exchange suggest that mutations at the Na(+)-H+ antiporter gene locus (APNH) might result in elevated SLC and contribute to the subsequent pathogenesis of hypertension. We have tested these hypotheses by genetic linkage analysis, with APNH as a candidate gene. By determining genotypes at APNH and flanking loci in pedigrees that support major gene segregation of elevated SLC, we have excluded linkage of APNH and the major SLC locus with a LOD score of -5.91, an odds ratio of almost 1,000,000:1 against linkage. In the analysis of 93 hypertensive sibling pairs, we have further demonstrated that APNH explains none of the variance in SLC in hypertensive individuals (r2 = 6 x 10(-7), p greater than 0.99). Finally, we have directly tested for linkage of APNH to genes predisposing toward hypertension by linkage in hypertensive sibling pairs. Mean allele sharing at APNH is not greater than expected from random assortment in hypertensive siblings (0.92 versus 1.0, p greater than 0.80), and the upper 95% confidence limit of this value (1.04) indicates that mutations at APNH rarely if ever contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension in this population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hypothalamic regulation of baroreceptor reflex sensitivity was assessed by recording responses to intravenously infused phenylephrine and afferent aortic nerve stimulation after sham operation or electrolytic destruction of the posterior hypothalamus. Regardless of age, reflex bradycardia and sympathoinhibition elicited during pressor responses to phenylephrine, as well as all cardiovascular and sympathetic nerve responses to afferent aortic nerve stimulation, were stronger in rats with bilateral hypothalamic lesions than in age-matched, sham-operated controls. Distinctively, because baroreceptor reflex sensitivity differed with age only in sham-operated controls but not in lesioned rats, we concluded that age-related differences in baroreceptor reflex sensitivity had been abolished by posterior hypothalamic lesions. Other experiments were then performed to compare responses to graded electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus in baroreceptor-intact rats. Pressor and sympathoexcitatory responses to hypothalamic stimulation were larger, and stimulus thresholds were lower at 10 than at 2 months of age thereby suggesting that hypothalamic responsiveness had increased with age. Our results are in accord with the interpretation that aging exacerbates the baroreceptor reflex suppression normally exerted by the posterior hypothalamus.\r"

  ".W": "Considerable evidence suggests that protein kinase C activation participates in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle tone. The objective of the current study was to examine the relations between inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) and myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) and vasorelaxation and blood pressure regulation in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Putative PKC inhibitors from two chemical classes, staurosporinelike (staurosporine and K252A) and isoquinolinesulfonamides (H7 and HA1004), were tested for their ability to 1) inhibit PKC and MLCK from SHR aorta, 2) relax isolated SHR aorta, and 3) lower blood pressure in conscious SHR. A rank order of potency for the inhibition of PKC and MLCK was established, with the staurosporinelike compounds (staurosporine PKC IC50 = 54 nM) clearly more potent than the isoquinolinesulfonamides (H7 PKC IC50 = 128 microM). The rank order of potency for inhibition of PKC was retained for inhibition of MLCK for all compounds. Staurosporine (EC50 = 75 nM) and H7 (EC50 = 2 microM) caused concentration-dependent relaxation of SHR aorta, but only staurosporine produced vasorelaxation at concentrations consistent with the inhibition of PKC or MLCK. Dose-dependent reductions in arterial pressure of SHR were demonstrated after intravenous injection of staurosporine and HA1004. A single intravenous injection of staurosporine (0.3 mg/kg) lowered blood pressure for more than 10 hours. Staurosporine also lowered blood pressure after oral administration. The depressor response to staurosporine was unaffected by sympathetic beta-adrenergic blockade. In conclusion, the vasorelaxant and antihypertensive actions of staurosporine in SHR are consistent with the inhibition of PKC but could also be equally related to inhibition of MLCK. Not all PKC inhibitors produce vasorelaxation and lower blood pressure. Moreover, the lack of correlation between in vitro vasodilation and PKC or MLCK inhibition for the isoquinolinesulfonamide protein kinase inhibitors H7 and HA1004 suggests that these agents do not cause vasorelaxation in SHR by inhibition of these enzymes.\r"

  ".W": "To identify characteristics that may contribute to salt sensitivity, we conducted studies of normal subjects who are at risk for hypertension, namely blacks, subjects older than 40 years of age, and first-degree relatives of subjects with essential hypertension. We also formulated definitions for salt sensitivity and resistance with a short-term volume expansion and contraction protocol and additionally from data derived from studies of long-term reduced dietary salt intake. We examined the effects of augmented potassium and calcium intake and also those of sodium as the chloride or the bicarbonate salt. Finally, we sought genetic markers that are associated with salt sensitivity. We found that salt sensitivity is a function of age and is more common in blacks than whites. These groups also have relatively delayed acute salt excretion compared with controls. We were unable to identify effects of gender. Haptoglobin phenotypes (HP 1-1) may facilitate identification of salt-sensitive individuals. A high potassium intake may make individuals less salt sensitive. Sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate differ in their effects on blood pressure. Sodium chloride augments urinary calcium excretion, but sodium bicarbonate does not. Differences between susceptible and nonsusceptible groups, together with improved knowledge of electrolyte interactions, may facilitate our understanding of salt-sensitive hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "This article addresses the methodology of sodium sensitivity assessment. There have been reports to suggest that a high sodium intake is a cause of elevated blood pressure and trials to indicate that a reduction in sodium intake may reduce blood pressure that is already high; the implications of these findings are discussed. Many studies on sodium sensitivity suffer from what could be called the \"normal probability fallacy\"; without appropriate control conditions, an intervention such as sodium restriction may incorrectly be assigned to a more pronounced response in a subgroup of the study population. As an example, findings are reviewed of age and sex as determinants of a response of blood pressure to variations in sodium intake. The limited data available suggest that subjects that are older and have higher blood pressure levels seem to benefit more from a reduction in sodium intake. In addition, elderly subjects at a high dietary sodium intake may have a higher risk of developing hypertension. Findings in both nonexperimental and experimental studies tend to support this view. Findings on sex differences are less consistent. A systematic approach to the assessment of factors and mechanisms responsible for sodium sensitivity in some subjects is needed to determine who might benefit most. Until more data are available, there is little basis to discriminate sodium-sensitive from sodium-resistant hypertensive subjects.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between sodium and blood pressure is a centuries-old question. A substantial body of epidemiological and experimental data has accumulated that strongly implicates NaCl as having a causal role in the genesis of arterial hypertension. Prospective studies that have been performed in diverse populations that have manipulated NaCl exposure by diet or infusion have repeatedly documented an NaCl pressor effect. Further, similar studies in biracial populations have also demonstrated a greater prevalence of \"salt sensitivity\" in blacks compared with whites. The reasons for this observation are not entirely clear; however, intrinsic or hypertension-induced renal abnormalities that limit natriuretic capacity, reduced Na+,K(+)-ATPase pump activity, other membrane ion transport disturbances, differential exposure to psychological stressors, greater insulin resistance, and dietary factors (reduced Ca+ and K+ intake) have all been suggested as possibly playing a role. Salt sensitivity appears to be a widespread phenomenon. However, it is critically important to determine what factors account for racial differences in salt sensitivity. Moreover, the prevalence of salt sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Current definitions of salt sensitivity are varied and unidirectional. In comparison with bidirectional criteria (blood pressure increase with salt loading and blood pressure decrease with salt restriction), they are probably inadequate to identify salt-sensitive individuals who manifest less extreme blood pressure change after dietary sodium or plasma volume manipulations. More sensitive criteria for diagnosing salt sensitivity will facilitate a better understanding of racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence of salt sensitivity.\r"

However, genetic factors that explain the higher average blood pressure levels of western hemisphere blacks when compared with African blacks have not been seriously considered. Because the genetic makeup of a population is largely determined by biological and ecological forces in the past, an examination of the biohistory of blacks, specifically the slavery era, was conducted. An overview of the salient findings of that investigation is included in this article. The published historical evidence on the transatlantic slave trade and New World slavery (from the 16th century to the 19th century) reveals that conditions existed for \"natural selection,\" and therefore, genetic changes were virtually inevitable in the slave populations. During this period of history, mortality was extremely high, and fertility (or reproductive success) was so low among the survivors that most plantation societies in the western hemisphere depended on a constant importation of captives (over 12 million) from Africa for the viability of the plantation communities. Because the major causes of death were salt-depletive diseases such as diarrhea, fevers, and vomiting, it is argued that individuals with an enhanced genetic-based ability to conserve salt had a distinct survival advantage over others and were, therefore, more likely to bequeath their genotype to subsequent generations of Western hemisphere blacks. Thus, it is predicted that blacks in the Americas have a greater frequency of individuals with an enhanced genetic-based ability to conserve salt than African blacks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the current patterns of excessive dietary salt intake create the potential for salt overload. Under these conditions, hypertension may be considered an expected pathological response to an evolutionarily new constraint. The transatlantic Middle Passage may have created a genetic bottleneck for salt conservation in African-Americans. Although the initial consequences of this important historical event probably constricted genetic variability and further magnified the potential for salt-sensitive hypertension, the Middle Passage undoubtedly also served as a more generalized major source of environmental stress and may have stimulated subsequent hereditary diversity in the survivors of this holocaust and their descendants. Accelerated rates of mutation, genetic recombination, and transposable genetic elements in conjunction with enhanced opportunities for gene flow, new selective pressures, and drift have all contributed to the tremendous heterogeneity of contemporary African-Americans. It is unlikely that a single genetic event, even of the severity of the Middle Passage, can account comprehensively for the apparent susceptibility of this macroethnic group to high blood pressure and hypertension.\r"

Most studies, where comparison can be made, suggest a greater effect for weight reduction than for the achieved, moderate, or short-term reduction in sodium intake on subsequent lowering of blood pressure; the lowering effect on blood pressure of weight reduction is independent of the effect of dietary sodium restriction. However, long-term (over a year) substantial reductions (up to 70 meq/day) of dietary sodium have not been achieved in comparative trials, nor are the effects of combined weight and sodium reduction in the prevention and treatment of hypertension quantified.

It is difficult to determine the appropriateness of these recommendations because of critical gaps in knowledge of the salt-blood pressure relation. There is no agreement on a definition of salt-sensitive blood pressure changes. There is no consensus about mechanisms of changes; several have been suggested but none seems universal. In fact, differing results suggest marked heterogeneity in the mechanisms of salt-sensitive hypertension, and some evidence points to the possibility that arterial pressure of hypertensive subjects is controlled differently than that of normotensive subjects during manipulation of salt intake. Because salt-sensitive blood pressure changes are not always related to the magnitude of the positive sodium balance, it seems possible that for some people the current recommendations for modest dietary sodium restriction may be inadequate to influence blood pressure control for the prevention of hypertension.\r"

In this paradigm, the impact of any given intake of an electrolyte on arterial pressure will be influenced by the concurrent consumption of other electrolytes. Thus, the heterogeneous blood pressure response in humans to isolated manipulations of nutrients such as sodium, calcium, and potassium may be determined, in part, by the adequacy of the dietary intake of other mineral elements. If this hypothesis is validated by continued research in this area, we would have new strategies available to improve blood pressure control in humans. For example, treatment of \"NaCl sensitivity\" in some humans might be more effectively approached by correcting dietary deficiencies of either potassium or calcium than by restricting dietary NaCl.\r"

Because recent evidence indicates that an acceptable salt substitute is unlikely, an understanding of the behavioral and sensory factors involved in maintaining high salt preference is a prerequisite to successful programs aimed at reducing intake. Although little evidence exists for a genetic determination of individual differences in consumption and preferred level of salt, more research in this area is necessary. Considerable data support the view that the optimal level of salt in the diet is determined in part by the level an individual is currently consuming; increasing or decreasing customary salt intake, as long as the salt is tasted, increases or decreases the preferred level of salt in food. Although these data are consistent with a hypothesis that optimal salt preferences are learned, other data, from both animal models and human developmental studies, suggest that salt preference has an innate component. Furthermore, early experience with low or high salt diets may have a long-term impact on preferred salt levels. Liking for salt, similar to liking for sweets, has an innate basis that can be modified by individual experience.\r"

Sodium reduction is one of the primary methods recommended for these purposes. The general public is interested in the reduction of dietary sodium intake and has responded with a decrease in table salt use, the purchase of lowered sodium food products, and the use of food labels to help guide food purchases. Countervailing trends in the use of convenience foods and dining out increase the difficulty for individuals to lower sodium intake. Clinical trials that have used sodium reduction alone or in combination with other lifestyle therapies have demonstrated the feasibility of reducing dietary sodium intake from 30% to 50% for up to 4 years, in a variety of populations. Trials that used lifestyle and weight loss interventions have also achieved significant reductions in body weight and alcohol consumption and increases in physical activity. A variety of studies indicate that long-term sodium reduction is feasible and that it is acceptable to patients. No negative consequences of these interventions have been observed, and in some cases improvement in the intake of other nutrients has occurred. Nonpharmacological interventions have resulted in hypertension control in significant proportions of the trial populations. These studies demonstrate that the foregoing types of interventions can significantly contribute to hypertension treatment and prevention.\r"

Changing dietary behavior requires relearning a range of habitual behaviors involved in day-to-day eating situations in the context of a diverse and complex food supply and in consideration of numerous factors, other than health concerns, that influence habitual eating patterns. Potential obstacles to dietary sodium reduction relate to the wide distribution of sodium in foods, the strong cultural values for salt, and the difficulty of assessing success in sodium reduction. A review of sodium interventions reported in the literature suggests that state-of-the-art behavioral change strategies can be effective in achieving reductions in sodium intake to around 3,000 mg/day but that this level is achieved only with highly motivated individuals and when a high level of intervention (i.e., intensive and multifaceted) is provided. Thus, in regard to sodium reduction in the general population, either the goal will have to be modest or the food supply will have to change so that substantial decreases in sodium intake can be accomplished with less intensive and less costly interventions.\r"

Dietary guidance recommendations call for moderation of dietary intake, improved nutrition, and greater availability in food choices in the marketplace that are consistent with dietary recommendations to reduce chronic disease risk. Health and nutrition monitoring allows measurement of the effectiveness of moderating dietary intake and controlling hypertension. Adequate support of education, nutrition and health monitoring, and biomedical research and training is necessary to control and prevent hypertension.

Because even mild hypertension increases risk, the overall problem does not appear to be amenable to treatment, although treatment for those with clinical hypertension will always be needed. There appears to be little likelihood that identification of those \"at risk\" will be successful, nor does it appear that we have the capacity at this time to conduct successful preventive field trials. It is difficult for the individual to modify his diet alone. The successful strategy is to modify the food supply by changing public demand. The public responds to dietary advice if acceptable and identifiable products are available. Because most of the salt is in commercially prepared foods and because their consumption will increase in the future, the major responsibility for lowering salt consumption will fall on the food manufacturers. They are beginning to respond, and there appears to be ample opportunity for them to reduce the salt content of foods markedly. Our temporary objectives, however, should be modest, because unrealistic objectives only discourage those who attempt to follow them.\r"

The Study of Sodium and Blood Pressure (SNaP) is a randomized, double-blind crossover trial using a placebo or 96 meq sodium in 4-week treatment periods separated by a 2-week washout period. Before capsule treatment periods, participants were instructed in a low sodium diet for 10 weeks to reduce urinary sodium excretion to less than 35 meq/8 hr. The low sodium diet was continued throughout the capsule treatment periods. Participants (n = 48; 47 white, 1 black) were 79% male and had an average age of 52 years, a body mass index of 27.6, and a baseline blood pressure of 131/84 mm Hg. Baseline overnight urinary sodium excretion was 51 meq/8 hr and 19 meq/8 hr after the low sodium diet run-in period, before the capsule treatment periods began. Resting, seated blood pressure was measured twice at each visit in a standard fashion. Differences between sodium and placebo treatment periods were as follows: systolic blood pressure, 123.9 versus 120.3 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.001); diastolic blood pressure, 78.7 versus 76.4 mm Hg, respectively (p = 0.005); and sodium excretion, 51.3 versus 30.9 meq/8 hr, respectively (p less than 0.001). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased significant amounts in normotensive adults on a low sodium diet supplemented with 96 meq/day sodium. Long-term effects and dose-response relations need further study.\r"

We excluded from pooled analyses trials with confounded designs, those that compared intake levels beyond the usual range in the population, and those without published reports. Two reviewers abstracted information in duplicate and differences were reconciled. Twenty-three trials with outcome data from an aggregate of 1,536 subjects were included. Data were pooled both separately for hypertensive and normotensive subjects and for all trials combined. With the use of sample size weighting, blood pressure reductions (net of controls) were 4.9 +/- 1.3/2.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg (systolic and diastolic, respectively, with 95% confidence limits) in hypertensive subjects and 1.7 +/- 1.0/1.0 +/- 0.7 mm Hg in normotensive subjects. The combined blood pressure reductions were 2.9 +/- 0.8/1.6 +/- 0.5 mm Hg. These changes were associated with mean reduction of urinary sodium excretion ranging from 16 to 171 mmol/24 hr for individual trials. A dose-response relation across trials was found, both in normotensive and in hypertensive subjects. These results indicate that sodium reduction lowers mean blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals for periods of at least several months. The findings are highly consistent with results of observational epidemiological studies and have implications for preventive strategies of blood pressure control.\r"

Within-population studies generally lack statistical power and are subject to major regression-dilution bias (because of considerable day-to-day variation in sodium intake), which could conceal true correlations between sodium and blood pressure. Nevertheless, an overview of reported studies that used 24-hour urine excretion to quantify intake shows positive and highly significant correlations between sodium and blood pressure for both men and women and for systolic and diastolic blood pressures. These results are consistent with the INTERSALT findings and those from trials of sodium restriction.\r"

Neural mechanisms and endocrine secretions play a pivotal role in the adaptation of mammals to changes in the intake and excretion of sodium. Maneuvers that alter the concentration of sodium in the plasma modify the sensitivity of baroreceptor reflexes and alter vascular reactivity. These changes may be mediated in part by the release of vasopressin. The research also suggests that the brain indirectly modulates the ability of the vascular endothelium to release vasoactive factors. Collectively, these studies illustrate the multiple effects of the sodium ion on the peripheral neural and central endocrine mechanisms that participate in the regulation of arterial pressure.\r"

  ".W": "A high NaCl diet can raise blood pressure in both susceptible people and in susceptible animals, and the mechanisms are probably quite similar for both humans and animals. The possibly harmful effects of a high NaCl diet are not unexpected since both prehistoric man and mammals evolved in a low NaCl world. Evolutionary forces molded mammals to adapt well to a low sodium intake; the modern high NaCl intake goes \"against the grain\" of this adaptation. The high NaCl diet can cause premature mortality by raising blood pressure in susceptible people. We have new evidence that in a hypertensive setting, a high NaCl diet can increase mortality even though it does not cause a further rise of blood pressure. Multiple small cerebral infarcts are a partial cause of this excess mortality. Recent evidence also indicates that a high potassium diet reduces the rise of blood pressure caused by a high NaCl diet, whereas a low normal potassium intake encourages an NaCl-induced rise of blood pressure. It is the combination of kidneys that tends to retain NaCl together with a high NaCl intake that produces a rise in blood pressure. This combination tends to cause NaCl retention, which can trigger a rise in blood pressure in susceptible humans and animals. Such a rise in blood pressure can augment renal NaCl excretion and regain the previous NaCl balance. In the Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rat, there are several renal abnormalities that would tend to encourage sodium retention. By analogy, renal \"abnormalities\" are probably present in people susceptible to hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The human studies have used widely varying methodologies and different criteria for sodium sensitivity. Nonetheless, these studies have produced convincing data that the blood pressure of some individuals is far more sensitive to the effects of sodium depletion or loading than that of others. Furthermore, a minority of the population appears to comprise acutely salt-sensitive individuals. Some studies have shown that sodium-sensitive individuals share several characteristics. They include increased forearm vascular resistance, decreased venous compliance, suppressed plasma renin activity, and lower circulating aldosterone concentration. These findings have also been described in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat, which suggest a genetic link in humans as well as the rat. Long-term follow-up of sodium-sensitive and sodium-resistant groups has shown that although blood pressure levels are approximately equal in the two groups during sodium depletion, resumption of a daily sodium intake of about 150 meq results in significantly higher levels of blood pressure and forearm vascular resistance in the sodium-sensitive group. This difference persists for at least 12 months.\r"

Significant recessive monogenic effects and high total heritability (52-84%) were found for urinary kallikrein, high fat pattern index, intraerythrocytic sodium, Na-Li countertransport, and ouabain binding sites. Familial correlations more strongly attributable to shared environment than to genetic effects were found for Na,K-ATPase pump activity, intraerythrocytic magnesium, plasma digoxin-like factor, plasma renin activity, and plasma sodium concentration. All anthropometric variables tested showed highly significant genetic heritability with low and insignificant shared family environmental effects. Several of the genetically determined cellular cation tests also correlated with other genetic traits including plasma lipids, anthropometric measurements, and other cellular cation tests.

These significant findings were derived from analyses for individuals from all 52 centers and from the 48 centers remaining when persons from four low sodium centers were excluded. Potassium excretion of individuals was significantly and independently related inversely to their systolic blood pressure. For men and women, both separate and combined, the relation between sodium and systolic blood pressure was stronger for older than younger adults, perhaps reflecting the result of longer exposure with age or diminished capacity to handle a sodium load. Relations between electrolyte excretion and diastolic blood pressure in individuals were weaker than for systolic blood pressure. Body mass index and heavy alcohol consumption of individuals were strongly and independently related to blood pressure. In cross-population analyses with n = 52 or n = 48, sample median sodium excretion was significantly and independently related to the slope of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure with age. Other ecological analyses yielded inconsistent results. Four isolated populations showed low sodium excretion, low sodium/potassium excretion, low body mass index, and low alcohol consumption; sample median blood pressures were low, there was little or no upward slope of blood pressure with age, and high blood pressure was rare or nonexistent.\r"

  ".W": "The long-term regulation of arterial pressure requires the maintenance of a balance between sodium and water intake and sodium and water excretion. Normal salt and water balance leads to stable body fluid volumes and the maintenance of normal renal function is critical to establishing extracellular fluid volume homeostasis. This review focuses on the role of the kidney in the long-term control of salt and water balance with particular emphasis on the relations between sodium intake, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, renal sympathetic nerve activity, and the regulation of arterial pressure via renal sodium and water excretion. The accumulation of evidence in recent years demonstrates that low level elevation of renin release, circulating angiotensin II or aldosterone, or activation of renal sympathetic outflow may alter renal function such that normal natriuretic and diuretic responses to arterial pressure are significantly impeded. Under these circumstances, the maintenance of normal sodium and water excretion requires a significant elevation of arterial pressure. Thus, compromised renal function leads to elevation of arterial pressure to maintain adequate sodium and water balance during periods of increased sodium intake. The resultant chronic elevation of arterial pressure then becomes a compromise that is used by the kidneys to maintain normal extracellular body fluid volumes.\r"

This is apparent despite the many methodological obstacles to defining salt sensitivity in an individual patient. Currently, dietary trial is the only sure means of defining a given patient as responsive to salt restriction. Easily definable markers of salt sensitivity would allow appropriate targeting of this rather ponderous therapy. Promising leads include the assessment of membrane ion transporters such as sodium-lithium exchange and of the activity of the renin-angiotensin system, including the phenomenon of \"non-modulating\" hypertension and other volume regulatory hormones such as atrial natriuretic factor. Although less intensively studied than in hypertensive patients, the blood pressure response of normal subjects to salt restriction is also marked by great variability. Given the possibility of deleterious consequences of population-wide salt restriction for at least some people in a setting such as the United States, it seems imprudent to recommend such a policy before its proven worth has been demonstrated by clinical trial. Pending such evidence and the development of markers, salt restriction should be reserved for those in whom it is of demonstrated efficacy.\r"

Because 100 of these patients received placebo in a double-blind fashion for 1 year, a comprehensive objective analysis was performed of spontaneous arrhythmia changes based on real data rather than statistical estimates. In the CAPS placebo group, 19% developed some serious clinical event in 1 year (death, heart failure, proarrhythmia) that could likely be attributable to antiarrhythmic drug toxicity. A significant reduction in the frequency of ventricular premature depolarizations (p = 0.004) occurred in the first few weeks of \"therapy\" with a further significant (p less than 0.04) decrease between 3 to 12 months. After initiation of placebo antiarrhythmic therapy, 27% had \"apparent ventricular premature depolarization suppression\" (greater than or equal to 70% reduction) after one Holter recording evaluation and nearly half (48%) after six Holter recordings to assess suppression were performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The microangioscope fits through an 8F coronary angioplasty guiding catheter and contains a multifiber viewing bundle incorporated into the body of a 4.3F balloon catheter with a central lumen for distal flushing and guide-wire passage. Angioscopy was performed without complications 45 times in 24 patients, including 6 patients with stable and 18 with unstable angina. Circumferential visualization of the target lesion was successful in 20 (83%) of the 24 patients and improved with operator experience. Excellent visualization of the target lesion was achieved in 16 (94%) of the last 17 patients. Plaque, thrombus and dissection were among the abnormal findings in the 20 patients (4 with stable, 16 with unstable angina) in whom circumferential viewing of the target lesion was achieved. In four patients with restenosis after angioplasty, the lesion morphology was distinctly different from that of lesions in arteries without prior angioplasty. In patients with stable angina, no thrombus or dissection was seen by angiography or angioscopy before angioplasty. In patients with unstable angina, thrombus was detected more frequently by angioscopy than by angiography before angioplasty (8 versus 2 of 16) and after (15 versus 2 of 16) angioplasty. Intimal dissection was also seen much more frequently by angioscopy than by angiography before angioplasty (7 versus 0 of 16) and after angioplasty (16 versus 7 of 16). It is concluded that high resolution percutaneous coronary angioscopy can be performed safely in conjunction with balloon angioplasty. Further investigation is needed before this diagnostic tool can be applied clinically.\r"

The study population consisted of 16 normal subjects and 40 patients with old myocardial infarction. The 40 patients were subdivided into two groups according to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure at rest: group I (22 patients), less than 18 mm Hg; group II (18 patients), 18 mm Hg or more. At rest, the ratio of peak velocity in atrial contraction phase to peak velocity in early diastolic filling phase (A/E) was significantly higher in the patients with old myocardial infarction than in normal subjects; values in the two subgroups of myocardial infarction did not differ significantly. The A/E ratio and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased significantly during exercise in group I. Conversely, the change in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure during exercise in group II was significantly greater than that in group I, and was associated with a decrease in the A/E ratio. Thus, an atrial compensatory mechanism operated effectively in response to the increase in afterload in patients with a normal left ventricular filling pressure, whereas this compensatory mechanism deteriorated in patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressure due to a limited preload reserve.\r"

The net force (F) associated with intraventricular flow throughout ejection can be written as: F = A.dv/dt + B.v2, where v is the ejection velocity and A and B are variables related to the geometry of the ventricle and its outflow tract. Instantaneous levels of this force were calculated in 9 normal subjects and 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy using Doppler, M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography. The maximal ejection force (Fmax) was 47.5 +/- 8.5 kdyn in normal subjects and 25.5 +/- 6.2 kdyn in those with dilated cardiomyopathy (p = 0.0001). Peak local acceleration and outflow velocity were severely depressed in those with cardiomyopathy compared with normal subjects (1,260 +/- 129 versus 2,671 +/- 430 cm/s2 and 71 +/- 14 versus 109 +/- 7 cm/s, respectively; p = 0.0001). Maximal ejection force was attained very early in ejection. A significant linear correlation was found between peak outflow acceleration and maximal ejection force (n = 19; r = 0.91, p = 0.0001). At the time of peak ejection velocity, the net force had decreased to 64% of its peak value in those with cardiomyopathy, whereas in normal subjects, it had decreased to only 84% of its peak value (p = 0.008). In normal subjects, the ejection force was positive during the first 75% of ejection, but in those with cardiomyopathy, it was positive only during the first 54% (p = 0.0003). Once its peak value was attained, total left ventricular systolic wall stress declined rapidly during ejection in normal subjects (to 33% of its peak value by end-ejection), whereas it remained elevated throughout ejection in patients with cardiomyopathy (at 60% of its peak value by end-ejection, p = 0.0001 versus normal). The maximal ejection force corresponded to a calculated intraventricular peak pressure gradient of 9.8 +/- 1.6 mm Hg in normal subjects and 6 +/- 1.2 mm Hg in those with cardiomyopathy (p = 0.0001). The average contribution of the intrinsic component of the left ventricular systolic load (that is, wall stress associated with the ventricular to aortic pressure gradient) to the total myocardial load was 9.1% (range 7.3% to 11.2%) in normal subjects and 6.2% (range 3.9% to 7.5%) in those with cardiomyopathy (p = 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Prolonged 60 degree head-up tilt has been shown to be valuable in the investigation of unexplained syncope, diagnosing neurally mediated bradycardia/hypotension or malignant vasovagal syndrome. To evaluate the methodology of tilt testing, the following were examined: reproducibility of results, tilt duration, angle of tilt, method of tilt support and effect of age in patients and control subjects. Seventy-one patients with recurrent unexplained syncope underwent 60 min of 60 degree tilt; 53 (75%) had an abnormal test with vasovagal syncope at 24 +/- 10 min (mean +/- SD). Tilting to 60 degrees resulted in an abnormal test in only 2 (7%) of 27 control subjects without cardiovascular symptoms (p less than 0.001); and 5 (15%) of 34 patients with syncope and documented conduction tissue disease (p less than 0.001). Of 15 youthful fainters, 3 (20%) had vasovagal reactions as did 1 (8%) of 12 asymptomatic youthful control subjects. These 12 control subjects also underwent tilting with a saddle support and 7 (67%) had vasovagal reactions. It is concluded that the duration of tilting at 60 degrees should be 45 min (mean time to syncope +2 x SD in the 53 patients with abnormal results). Twenty percent of patients with an abnormal tilt test may not demonstrate syncope with repeat tilting. Saddle tilt testing in unexplained syncope may result in a loss of specificity. Tilting at less than 60 degrees results in a loss of sensitivity. Head-up tilt may be less useful in youthful subjects with vasovagal syncope than in other subjects.\r"

Programmed electrical stimulation was performed twice, using the same protocol during 53 drug-free studies and 53 subsequent studies on antiarrhythmic therapy. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was reproduced in 104 (98%) of the 106 studies. There was no significant difference in the incidence of reproducible tachycardia in the drug-free state compared with that observed during treatment with different classes of antiarrhythmic drugs. An increase in the number of extrastimuli was required to reinitiate the tachycardia in 9 (11%) of 83 studies in which single or double extrastimuli were initially required to induce the tachycardia. In 39 (37%) of 104 studies with reproducible tachycardia induction, the two tachycardias significantly differed in electrocardiographic (ECG) configuration and cycle length. These observations suggest that the overall reproducibility of ventricular tachycardia induction is sufficiently high to provide a reliable marker for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. However, specific tachycardia characteristics such as cycle length and ECG configuration are more variable even within the same study and may be less useful in assessing the effects of subsequent interventions.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the spatial resolution of unipolar pace-mapping, 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) recorded during pacing from each of the poles of a quadripolar catheter (5 mm interelectrode distance) were examined. Unipolar pacing was performed from each of the poles at late diastolic threshold, twice threshold and 10 mA at a cycle length of 500 ms. In 15 patients, pacing was performed at the right ventricular apex and in 14 at various left ventricular sites. Pacing from the distal catheter pole at threshold (index ECG) was used to simulate the site of origin of ventricular tachycardia, and all other ECGs were compared with the index ECG. Electrocardiograms were evaluated by two independent observers for 1) minor configuration differences (notch, new small component, change in the amplitude of individual components or change in QRS shape); 2) major differences in configuration (new large component, marked change in the amplitude of an existing component or two minor changes); and 3) peak to peak changes in amplitude. Minor differences in configuration were seen in a mean 2.4 +/- 1.9, 4.6 +/- 2.4 and 4.4 +/- 2.9 leads during pacing at 5, 10 and 15 mm from the distal electrode (index site). Major differences in configuration were seen in a mean of 0.3 +/- 0.5, 2.1 +/- 2.1 and 3.7 +/- 2.3 leads during pacing at 5, 10 and 15 mm from the index site. Differences in amplitude were seen in a mean of 3.1 +/- 2.2, 5.6 +/- 2.5 and 6.8 +/- 3.0 leads per ECG during pacing at 5, 10 and 15 mm from the index ECG pacing site, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore, the clinical and electrophysiologic data of 101 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome referred for invasive evaluation of known arrhythmias were reviewed to assess the incidence and clinical relevance of syncope. Thirty-six patients reported the occurrence of one or more syncopal episodes (group 1) and 65 patients had no syncope (group 2). These two groups did not differ significantly with regard to age, gender, incidence and characteristics of arrhythmia, clinical history, frequency of arrhythmic events and presence of associated cardiac disease. There were 10 patients in group 1 and 12 in group 2 who had ventricular fibrillation. There were no statistical differences between the two groups with respect to the effective refractory period of the right atrium, atrioventricular node, accessory pathway and right ventricle. Furthermore, no differences between the two groups were noted with respect to cycle length of circus movement tachycardia, mean heart rate during atrial fibrillation, and minimum RR interval during atrial fibrillation. In addition, the accessory pathway location was not significantly different between group 1 and group 2. The occurrence of syncope could not be predicted from any electrophysiologic finding and this symptom had a low sensitivity and specificity for recognition of dangerous rapid heart rates. Furthermore, the prognostic value of syncope was less accurate and predictive than the shortest RR interval during atrial fibrillation and the anterograde effective refractory period of the accessory pathway for aborted sudden death occurrence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One fetus was excluded from data analysis because a more complex heart lesion was documented at autopsy. All fetuses had massive right atrial dilation and most who were serially studied had progressive right-sided cardiomegaly. Hydrops fetalis was found in six cases and atrial flutter in five. Associated cardiac lesions included pulmonary stenosis in five cases and pulmonary atresia in six. Four fetuses with normal forward pulmonary artery flow at the initial examination were found at subsequent study to have retrograde pulmonary artery and ductal flow in association with the development of pulmonary stenosis (n = 1) and pulmonary atresia (n = 3). On review of the clinical course of the 23 fetuses (excluding 3 with elective abortion), 48% of the fetuses died in utero and 35% who were liveborn died despite vigorous medical and, when necessary, surgical management, many of whom had severe congestive heart failure. Of the four infants who survived the neonatal period, three had a benign neonatal course, all of whom were diagnosed with mild to moderate Ebstein's anomaly; only one had pulmonary outflow obstruction.

In this study the electrophysiologic effects of the Fontan procedure were evaluated in 30 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization with electrophysiologic study 1.9 +/- 1.3 years (mean +/- SD) after modified Fontan repair for functional single ventricle. Abnormalities of sinus node or ectopic pacemaker automaticity were detected in 50% (15 patients) by determination of a prolonged corrected sinus node or pacemaker recovery time. Total sinoatrial conduction time was prolonged in 50% of the patients with normal sinus rhythm. Sinus node or ectopic atrial pacemaker function was entirely normal in only 43% of patients. The predominant atrial rhythm was normal sinus in 70% and ectopic atrial or junctional in 30%. Abnormalities of atrial effective and functional refractory periods were noted in 43% of patients and were most pronounced at faster paced cycle lengths. Atrial endocardial catheter mapping revealed intraatrial conduction delays between adjacent sites in 76% of the patients tested and in eight of nine patients with inducible intraatrial reentry. Programmed atrial stimulation induced nonsustained supraventricular arrhythmias in 10% of the 30 patients and sustained arrhythmias in 27%. Intraatrial reentry was the most common inducible arrhythmia and was present in seven of the eight patients with sustained and two of the three patients with nonsustained atrial arrhythmias. Atrioventricular conduction abnormalities were noted in 10% (three patients). No patient had inducible ventricular arrhythmias with programmed ventricular stimulation.

The patients presented after the 1st year of life and had not undergone surgical intervention. All except one were in functional class II. No patient had preexcitation on the surface ECG, but abnormal tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias were seen in five patients on 24 h ECG monitoring. Subnormal exercise performance was observed in five patients. Echocardiography demonstrated typical variable tricuspid valve displacement and paradoxic interventricular septal motion. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions were normal in all patients, but posterior wall motion was reduced in two. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation with a Doppler jet velocity less than 2.5 m/s was demonstrated in eight patients. Left ventricular radionuclide scintigraphy revealed a subnormal ejection fraction (less than 50%) in 5 of 10 patients; these 5 had previously shown suboptimal exercise performance. The two youngest patients (less than 15 years) had no arrhythmia, normal exercise performance and normal left ventricular ejection fraction. There was no correlation between the degree of tricuspid valve displacement or regurgitation and the presence of rhythm disturbance, exercise performance or radionuclide left ventricular function. Late evaluation of patients with Ebstein's anomaly may demonstrate significant unsuspected abnormalities in cardiac rhythm, exercise performance and left ventricular function. Radionuclide scintigraphy is a useful noninvasive technique for assessing left ventricular dysfunction in these patients.\r"

Of 492 patients undergoing the procedure, 37 (7.5%) died during the hospital stay in which valvuloplasty was performed. Twenty-four of these patients died within the first 24 h and the remainder died within 7 days after the procedure. There were significant differences in baseline clinical and hemodynamic characteristics as well as procedural and postprocedural variables between patients dying and those surviving the in-hospital period. Multivariate analysis identified four factors associated with increased mortality: 1) the occurrence of a procedure-related complication, 2) a lower initial left ventricular systolic pressure, 3) a smaller final aortic valve area, and 4) a lower baseline cardiac output. Thus, baseline hemodynamic, procedural and postprocedural variables and complications can be identified that are associated with increased mortality.\r"

At 1 year the overall survival rate was 64% and the event-free survival rate (survival free of valve replacement or repeat valvuloplasty) was 43%. Clinical, catheterization and procedural variables were assessed to define prognostic variables. Univariate analysis revealed that patients who survived had a lesser frequency of previous myocardial infarction (2% versus 6%, p less than 0.005), lower incidence of severe ventricular dysfunction (22% versus 48%, p less than 0.001) and lower incidence of symptoms of heart failure (60% versus 75%, p less than 0.02). History of angina (56% versus 45%, p = NS) and syncope (23% versus 16%, p = NS) were similar for both groups. Values obtained at cardiac catheterization that differed in survivors and nonsurvivors included lower pulmonary artery systolic pressure (43 +/- 1 versus 54 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), lower mean pulmonary artery pressure (28 +/- 1.0 versus 36 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and larger initial valve area (0.52 +/- 0.01 versus 0.47 +/- 0.02 cm2, p = 0.006). Discriminate function analysis was performed to identify variables that independently predicted improved probability of survival. Eight variables were significantly and independently predictive.

To assess the effects of preload on ventricular load coupling, preload was reduced with a lower body negative pressure of -20 mm Hg. Nitroprusside was used to evaluate the effects of afterload on the coupling under the condition that preload reduction was comparable to that with lower body negative pressure. In 13 patients with heart failure (ejection fraction 32 +/- 3%, mean +/- SE), direct arterial pressure was simultaneously recorded with the left ventricular echocardiogram as the pressure was elevated by phenylephrine. Left ventricular contractile properties were defined by the slope (Ees) of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation. The effective arterial elastance (Ea) was expressed by the slope of the end-systolic pressure-stroke volume relation. Left ventricular external work, end-systolic potential energy and work efficiency, defined as external work per pressure volume area (external work + potential energy), were determined. Baseline ventricular load coupling in these patients was characterized by an increase in the ratio of arterial elastance to ventricular elastance (Ea/Ees) (1.96 +/- 0.31). This ratio decreased significantly, to 1.45 +/- 0.22, with nitroprusside, and increased to 2.37 +/- 0.34 with lower body negative pressure. Therefore, end-systolic potential energy was decreased by nitroprusside but was unaltered by lower body negative pressure while external work was comparably decreased by both manipulations, indicating that work efficiency was significantly augmented with nitroprusside but declined with lower body negative pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of infusing human alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide were studied in eight patients with congestive heart failure, five normal rabbits and five rabbits with adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy. In patients with heart failure, calcitonin gene-related peptide caused a dose-dependent increase in cardiac output and decrease in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure. The systemic blood pressure and right atrial and pulmonary wedge pressures decreased only at the highest infusion rate (16 ng/kg per min). Heart rate remained unchanged. Plasma epinephrine increased (p less than 0.05), whereas aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide and prolactin concentrations decreased (p less than 0.05). Plasma norepinephrine, renin activity, cortisol and growth hormone concentrations remained unchanged. In both groups of rabbits, the drug decreased blood pressure and increased cardiac output and heart rate. There was a significant increase in renal blood flow (p less than 0.05). The peptide did not affect the contraction amplitude of human and rabbit ventricular myocytes. These findings suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide is a vasodilator in the rabbit and humans with little direct effect on ventricular myocardium. This peptide may be useful in some forms of heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "The single sucrose gap voltage clamp technique has been used to study the relation between membrane electrical activity and tension generation in right ventricular papillary muscles from New Zealand White rabbits at various stages of development. In response to voltage clamp-controlled depolarization, muscles from newborn rabbits develop monotonically increasing tension that reaches a steady state level, whereas more mature myocardium responds to similar depolarization by developing an early peak of tension before relaxing to a steady state level. The ratio of early peak or phasic tension to steady state or tonic tension increases significantly with maturation. Calcium (Ca2+) loading of immature myocytes enhances phasic tension in a subsequent test depolarization. Although the voltage dependence of tonic tension increases monotonically in all age groups, phasic tension, seen only in the more mature myocardium, displays a \"bell-shaped\" dependence on voltage. Addition of ryanodine, known to interfere with Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, markedly reduces the phasic component of tension in mature myocardium, and the voltage clamp-induced tension in the adult closely resembles that of the normal newborn. These results suggest that tension development in immature myocardium is supported largely by the influx of Ca2+ across the sarcolemma. As the myocardium matures, the sarcoplasmic reticulum plays an increasingly important role in tension generation. A developmental schema is presented to account for the observed maturational changes in excitation-contraction coupling. The clinical implications of these changes are discussed as they relate to the practice of pediatric cardiology.\r"

The 639 men and 187 women ranged in age from 31 to 85 years. Successful angioplasty (residual stenosis less than 50% and no major complications) was achieved in 886 (88.6%) of 1,000 lesions. Success rates were uniform among the eight individual centers. Outcome was not influenced by gender, age or other clinical features, including severity and duration of angina, prior myocardial infarction, rest pain, transient ST segment elevation, history of smoking or diabetes. In contrast, procedural outcome was significantly associated with lesion-specific angiographic factors. Stenoses 60% to 74%, 75% to 89%, 90% to 99% and 100% were associated with success rates of 96%, 90%, 84% and 69%, respectively (p less than 0.001). Angioplasty was less successful in calcified than in noncalcified lesions (82% versus 90%, p less than 0.01), in thrombotic than in nonthrombotic lesions (82% versus 90%, p less than 0.05) and in lesions in the right coronary artery than in other vessels (84% versus 90%, p less than 0.01). Outcome was not related to other anatomic variables, including lesion location (proximal versus distal), vessel size, eccentricity, stenosis length or translesional gradient. By multivariate logistic regression, preangioplasty percent stenosis, right coronary artery location and lesion calcification were demonstrated to be significant independent predictors of angioplasty success. Alternative clinical and angiographic variables did not contribute to this regression model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With increasing heart rate, similar changes were seen with all three interventions and included: 1) mitral flow velocity in early diastole and the early diastolic transmitral pressure gradient either changed minimally or did not change; 2) mitral flow velocity at the start of and as a result of atrial contraction progressively increased; 3) the \"absolute\" increase in mitral flow velocity and transmitral pressure gradient at atrial contraction demonstrated a biphasic response, initially decreasing as heart rate increased, but then increasing again when atrial contraction occurred in close proximity (less than 70 ms) to mitral valve opening; 3) mitral flow velocity at atrial contraction did not exceed mitral flow velocity in early diastole until atrial contraction was within 70 ms of mitral valve opening and the two velocity peaks were nearly fused; and 4) the largest transmitral pressure gradient and mitral flow velocity occurred at the fastest heart rates, when left atrial contraction preceded mitral valve opening. Major differences among methods included: 1) variable changes in PR interval (+14.2 +- 8.9 ms with atrial pacing versus -74 +/- 26 ms with isoproterenol at peak heart rate compared with baseline); 2) variable changes in the speed of left ventricular relaxation (-2.8 +/- 2.8 ms with pacing versus -7.6 +/- 2.4 ms with isoproterenol at peak rate); and 3) the heart rate at which equalization of mitral flow velocity in early diastole and mitral flow velocity at atrial contraction velocity occurred (128 +/- 12 beats/min with pacing versus 185 +/- 19 beats/min with isoproterenol). These results show that regardless of method, qualitatively similar changes in mitral flow velocity and transmitral pressure gradient occur as heart rate increases. However, for any given heart rate, mitral flow velocity variables and late diastolic pressure gradient can be markedly different, depending on whether atrial pacing, withdrawal of parasympathetic tone or sympathetic stimulation is the cause of the increase in heart rate. These differences among methods appear most related to their effect on PR interval and to a lesser extent the rate of letf ventricular isovolumic relaxation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91100638\r", 
  ".W": "Pericardial effusion is associated with an abnormal increase in respiratory variation in mitral flow velocity. However, the relation of the changes in flow velocity to pericardial pressure, hemodynamics and two-dimensional echocardiographic findings is not established. Therefore, 11 sedated dogs with extensive hemodynamic instrumentation were studied with two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography during four stages of progressively larger pericardial effusion. During all stages of effusion, respiratory variation in peak mitral flow velocity in early diastole and left ventricular isovolumetric relaxation time was increased compared with baseline (p less than 0.05). This increase was seen at the earliest stage of effusion (mean pericardial pressure 4.2 +/- 1.4 versus -0.8 +/- 0.9 mm Hg at baseline, p less than 0.05), and preceded the appearance of unequivocal diastolic right heart collapse in every dog. Maximal respiratory variation coincided with the appearance of right atrial collapse (mean pericardial pressure 7.1 +/- 2.4 mm Hg; mean inspiratory decrease in aortic pressure 9.5 +/- 2.6 mm Hg; mean aortic pressure 88.2 +/- 15.2 versus 102.2 +/- 11.2 mm Hg at baseline, p less than 0.05; and cardiac output 3.8 +/- 1.2 versus 5.5 +/- 1.3 liters/min at baseline, p less than 0.05), but did not increase at stages associated with more severe hemodynamic compromise. In addition, the respiratory changes in peak mitral flow velocity in early diastole were associated with simultaneous changes in the diastolic transmitral pressure gradient. It is concluded that in this model of acute pericardial effusion 1) increased respiratory variation in early diastolic mitral flow velocity, peak mitral flow velocity in early diastole and left ventricular isovolumetric relaxation time occurs almost immediately as pericardial pressure increases and persists at all stages of increasing pericardial effusion; 2) the abnormal respiratory variation occurs before equalization of intracardiac pressures and before the onset of unequivocal right heart collapse; 3) the respiratory variation occurs as a result of changes in the diastolic transmitral pressure gradient; and 4) the magnitude of the respiratory change is not necessarily predictive of pericardial pressure or severity of hemodynamic compromise, especially at the more severe stages of pericardial effusion.\r"

  ".U": "91100640\r", 
  ".W": "Restenosis, the major limitation of balloon angioplasty, is the result of intimal hyperplasia after the procedure. Lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) inhibitor, may influence intimal hyperplasia by lowering serum cholesterol and by blocking deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis. To determine whether lovastatin reduces intimal hyperplasia, a prospective, randomized blinded study was performed in 60 atherosclerotic New Zealand White male rabbits. Atherosclerosis was produced by air desiccation injury followed by a 28 day diet of 2% cholesterol and 6% peanut oil that was terminated before balloon angioplasty was performed. Angioplasty could not be performed in 14 rabbits with bilateral femoral artery occlusion, and in one rabbit the procedure was a technical failure. Forty-five rabbits underwent balloon angioplasty performed with use of a 2.5-mm balloon inflated to 10 atm for three 1 min dilations at 1 min intervals. Seven rabbits died during the procedure. Thirty-eight rabbits were randomized to either a lovastatin group (6 mg/kg body weight per day) or a control group. Angioplasty was performed on all patent vessels (n = 54); the procedure was bilateral in 16 rabbits and unilateral in 22. Fifteen lovastatin-treated and 15 control rabbits survived 39 days after angioplasty and were then killed. Angiograms, obtained before and 10 min and 39 days after balloon angioplasty, were read with use of electronic calipers by two observers who had no knowledge of treatment data. After the rabbits were killed, vessels were pressure perfused using a standardized protocol to maintain in vivo dimensions for blinded quantitative histologic analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To derive a quantitative index of regional myocardial blood flow, the arterial input function of the flow tracer N-13 ammonia and the regional myocardial N-13 activity concentrations were noninvasively determined in 29 experiments in eight dogs. N-13 ammonia was administered intravenously and cross-sectional images were acquired dynamically using an ECAT III positron emission tomograph with an effective in-plane resolution of 13.46 mm full-width half-maximum. Time-activity curves were derived from the serial images by assigning regions of interest to the left ventricular myocardium and left ventricular blood pool. Tracer net extractions were estimated from the myocardial time-activity concentrations at various times after tracer injection and the integral of the arterial input function. Myocardial blood flow was altered by intravenous dipyridamole, morphine, propranolol and partial or complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and ranged from 9 to 860 ml/min per 100 g. Estimates of tracer net extractions were most accurate when determined from the myocardial N-13 activity concentrations at 60 s divided by the integral of the arterial input function to that time. These estimates correlated with regional myocardial blood flows determined independently by the microsphere technique by y = x (1 - 0.64(e-114/x); SEE = 22.9; r = 0.94). First pass extraction fractions of N-13 ammonia determined noninvasively with this approach declined with higher flows in a nonlinear fashion and were similar to those determined invasively by direct intracoronary N-13 ammonia injections. The findings indicate that an accurate index of regional myocardial blood flow can be obtained noninvasively by high temporal sampling of arterial and myocardial tracer activity concentrations with positron emission tomography. They also provide a basis for the in vivo application of tracer kinetic principles to derive quantitatively and noninvasively regional rates of functional processes in human myocardium.\r"

Echocardiograms were performed before or during cardiac surgery; cardiac catheterization was also performed in 28 patients (72%). Mitral valve disease was confirmed at cardiac surgery in all patients. By echocardiography, the presence of a flail mitral valve leaflet was defined by the presence of abnormal mitral leaflet coaptation or ruptured chordae. Using these criteria, transesophageal imaging showed a trend toward greater sensitivity and specificity than precordial imaging in the diagnosis of flail mitral valve leaflet. By Doppler color flow mapping, a flail mitral valve leaflet was also characterized by an eccentric, peripheral, circular mitral regurgitant jet that closely adhered to the walls of the left atrium. The direction of flow of the eccentric jet in the left atrium distinguished a flail anterior from a flail posterior leaflet. By transesophageal echocardiography with Doppler color flow mapping, the ratio of mitral regurgitant jet arc length to radius of curvature was significantly higher in Group I than Group II patients (5.0 +/- 2.3 versus 0.7 +/- 0.6, p less than 0.001); all of the Group I patients and none of the Group II patients had a ratio greater than 2.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitor is a device developed approximately 30 years ago to detect, locate and document hemodynamic insufficiency states in target organs with compromised regional arterial circulations. These insufficiency states are usually silent until they are suddenly precipitated by secondary remote, hemodynamically significant cardiac arrhythmias, hypotensive states caused by internal hemorrhage or reduced cardiac output including cardiogenic shock. Insufficiency events cause serious regional dysfunction, resulting in transitory or permanent damage of the remote target organs (brain, heart, splanchnic and renal) often causing paralytic ileus, gangrene of the gut or rectum, myocardial infarction or cerebral stroke. Comprehensive experimental studies conducted in the author's laboratory over a period of years (1946-1971) proved that such remote ischemic states are often recurrent and can cause serious, irreparable damage, but whenever the cause of the regional ischemic state was treated promptly it could reverse the insufficiency state. Practical ambulatory ECG diagnostic monitors and data reduction systems were developed to diagnose these elusive precipitating pathophysiologic events that might coincide with the patient's symptoms and thus determine the most appropriate preventive therapy.\r"

Technique was also not a risk factor for a second mitral commissurotomy, subsequent mitral valve replacement, thromboembolism or poor functional status. Risk factors were older age at commissurotomy, black race, higher pulmonary vascular resistance, mitral leaflet calcification, left ventricular enlargement and postcommissurotomy mitral incompetence. The closed technique was a risk factor for mitral incompetence immediately after commissurotomy, but important incompetence developed in only 2 of the 103 patients undergoing closed commissurotomy. Mitral valve replacement was not required within 10 years in 78% of patients and within 20 years in 47%. Despite some increased prevalence of postcommissurotomy mitral incompetence and particularly in view of the considerable long-term likelihood of mitral valve replacement, initial therapy for most patients with mitral stenosis should probably be surgical closed (or percutaneous balloon) mitral commissurotomy. The equations developed in the present study can be used to predict and compare outcome probability after percutaneous balloon commissurotomy with that after surgical commissurotomy and to compare these with outcome probability after mitral valve replacement.\r"

These flow variations are associated with transient platelet aggregation and dislodgment and the release of selected mediators, including thromboxane A2 and serotonin. However, cyclic or spontaneous flow variations have not been demonstrated in stenosed coronary arteries in humans. In this study, the hypothesis was tested that spontaneous coronary blood flow velocity variations occur in some patients with stenosed coronary arteries before or after coronary artery angioplasty. Thus, 13 patients with severe and limiting angina underwent intracoronary pulsed Doppler velocimetry of their dilated artery immediately before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, whereas 9 control patients underwent velocimetry of an angiographically normal coronary artery. A 3F catheter with a 20 MHz Doppler crystal was positioned to achieve a maximal stable signal, and the flow velocity signal was recorded continuously for 20 min. Spontaneous flow velocity variations (greater than or equal to 38% change in Doppler frequency shift with wide morphologic changes) were present in 3 of the 13 patients tested. Spontaneous flow velocity variations occurred before angioplasty in one patient, after angioplasty in another and both before and after angioplasty in a third. In addition, 2 of the 13 patients, 1 with spontaneous coronary artery flow velocity variations before angioplasty, had frank vasospasm in an adjacent area just distal to the area of coronary dilation immediately after balloon inflation. These data establish that spontaneous coronary artery flow velocity variations occur in some patients with severe and limiting angina before and after coronary angioplasty. These variations may be related to platelet aggregation or coronary vasoconstriction, or both, at sites of endothelial injury resulting from plaque fissuring or ulceration and endothelial and medial injury occurring during coronary angioplasty.\r"

Plasma beta-endorphin levels were elevated and correlated with the patients' New York Heart Association functional cardiac status (control: 14.0 +/- 4.4 pg/ml; class II: 17.9 +/- 3.6 pg/ml; class III: 28.3 +/- 8.8 pg/ml; class IV: 46.7 +/- 14.6 pg/ml, mean +/- SD). No relation was found between plasma beta-endorphin levels and left ventricular systolic performance as assessed by M-mode and Doppler echocardiography. Plasma beta-endorphin levels were negatively correlated with cardiac output determined by Doppler echocardiography and positively correlated with systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.733, r = 0.747, respectively, both p less than 0.001), but not correlated with calf blood flow as measured by a plethysmography. A good correlation was found between plasma beta-endorphin levels at rest and exercise capacity. The correlations with peak oxygen consumption, anaerobic threshold, and peak rate-pressure product were r = -0.721, -0.672, and -0.674, respectively (p less than 0.01). The data show that plasma beta-endorphin levels are elevated in patients with congestive heart failure and reflect, to some degree, the severity of the disease.\r"
