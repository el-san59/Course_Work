  ".W": "The effect of ventilation (normo-, hypo-, and hyperventilation) on transverse sinus pressure (TSP), central venous pressure (CVP), mean arterial blood pressure (mABP), and heart rate was studied in 15 patients undergoing neurosurgical treatment in the sitting position for tumors of the posterior fossa, and the findings were compared with the influence of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) on these parameters. TSP was not influenced significantly by PEEP ranging from 0 to 15 mbar, whereas CVP increased. At the same time, mABP decreased slightly. In contrast, TSP showed characteristic changes with varying ventilation: during normoventilation [end expiratory CO2 pressure (PECO2), 38 mm Hg], TSP was 3 mm Hg and increased to 7 mm Hg on average with hypoventilation (PECO2, 44 mm Hg), whereas hyperventilation (PECO2, 32 mm Hg) caused a reduction in TSP to the atmospheric range. At the same time, CVP remained unchanged, whereas mABP increased with hypoventilation. Presuming that the risk of venous air embolism is closely related to the level of TSP, our results allow the following conclusions. 1) PEEP does not seem to be effective in preventing venous air embolism. 2) Hyperventilation is dangerous in the sitting position, as TSP is reduced to the atmospheric and even subatmospheric range. 3) To prevent air embolism, moderate hypoventilation is recommended during the most critical period of exposing the posterior fossa followed by normoventilation when surgery of the actual lesion has begun.\r"

There is, however, very little information available regarding human intracerebral temperature and its relation to body core temperature during normal and pathological circumstances. We therefore made continuous measurements of the temperature of the lateral ventricle in 15 neurosurgical patients utilizing a newly developed technique with copper-constantan thermocouples introduced through a plastic catheter also used for monitoring intracranial pressure. The intraventricular temperature was higher than the rectal temperature during approximately 90% of all measurements. The largest temperature gradient measured was 2.3 degrees C. Usually the difference between the temperature of the rectum and the brain was much smaller, the mean value being 0.33 degrees C. For the patients in the most severe condition, the rectal temperature was sufficiently close to the brain temperature to afford a reliable basis for adequate clinical judgment.\r"

This telecanthal approach involves 1) bilateral en bloc removal of the superior lateral rim of the orbit, the nasal bone, and the posterior lateral wall of the orbit; 2) detachment of the medial canthal ligaments; and 3) spreading of the interocular distance. This approach provides a wide working space beneath the anterior half of the midline skull base, and needs neither a facial incision nor significant retraction of the brain. The surgical technique and its modification are described. The discussion focuses not only on comparisons with other techniques, but on the indications for this approach. Meningiomas originating in the paranasal sinuses are rare; a brief review of the literature concerning the clinicopathological features and pathogenesis is also given.\r"

It provides blood supply to the 3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerves, as well as to the gasserian ganglion. The ILT anastomoses to branches of the internal maxillary artery, providing collateral circulation between the external carotid artery and the ICA systems. Retinal and cerebral emboli can arise from the external carotid artery system and travel via the ILT to the ICA. Cranial nerve palsies may result after occlusion of the ILT. We present the cases of four patients who had iatrogenic neurological dysfunction subsequent to intravascular procedures that involved the ILT. These cases provide further clinical confirmation of the importance of this blood vessel. A 5th case involving iatrogenic occlusion of the ILT and no neurological deficit is also presented, demonstrating that the ILT is not the sole blood supply of the cranial nerves in the cavernous sinus.\r"

The aneurysm was 7 x 7 x 5 cm in size and its neck was situated just distal to the right subclavian artery.

A continuous infusion of methotrexate (1 mg/d) was begun with concomitant oral administration of folinic acid. The methotrexate dose was increased every 2 weeks to 3, 10, 30, and, ultimately, 75 mg/d in two patients. Samples of serum and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained to determine the levels of methotrexate and total bioactive folates, and brain tissue was obtained from two patients for determination of methotrexate concentration. The patients survived from 7 to 49 weeks after the implantation of the infusion device. Neither the clinical examination nor sequential radiological studies gave clear evidence of reduction in tumor size. Pneumonia developed in one patient, and mild hepatitis and increased seizure frequency in another. Methotrexate was stable in the delivery system over 12 days, and ventricular CSF reached steady-state levels by 5 days. Steady-state ventricular CSF levels of methotrexate were higher than serum levels in some patients, while the reverse was true in others. Levels of total bioactive folates in the CSF did not increase above the normal range. Methotrexate concentrations were highest at the center of the tumor, but measurable amounts of methotrexate were detectable in all areas of the brain. At autopsy in four patients, variable liquefactive necrosis of the brain tumors was seen, and viable tumor was found at the periphery of the tumor bed. These preliminary results suggest that it is technically feasible to infuse methotrexate into brain tumor cavities, and show that little central nervous system or systemic toxicity was encountered in five patients. Better delineation of the safety and efficacy of this therapeutic approach will require further clinical trials.\r"

Our findings support the concept that urine drug screening for cocaine and/or other drugs of abuse should be considered in patients who present with no prenatal care, premature labor, premature delivery, and delivery of an infant with a 1-minute Apgar score of 6 or less. This strategy may enable us to identify and bring to therapy a population of women that could potentially go unrecognized.\r"

Heart rate was measured in 603 embryos; of these, 580 continued beyond 13 weeks' gestation and 23 ended in first-trimester spontaneous abortion. Based on the continuing pregnancies, we constructed and compared EHR nomograms relating to gestational age, mean diameter of the gestational sac, and crown-rump length (CRL). Embryonic heart rate correlated best with CRL (r = 0.87), and the correlation was best described by a second-degree polynomial regression equation. The mean EHR increased progressively from 110 beats per minute (bpm) at CRL of 3-4 mm to 171-178 bpm at CRL 15-32 mm. At CRL greater than 32 mm, the EHR remained stable at a mean of 170 bpm. The EHRs of the 23 embryos that spontaneously aborted in the first trimester were evaluated according to these nomograms. In 15 cases, the EHR fell outside the 95% confidence interval for CRL (sensitivity 65%), but it was within normal limits in eight (false-negative rate 35%). In ten embryos for which pregnancy continued beyond 13 weeks, the EHR fell outside the 95% confidence interval (specificity 98%, false-positive rate 2%). Our findings suggest that EHR measurements in early pregnancy may be useful in the prediction of first-trimester spontaneous abortion after ultrasound-proven viability.\r"

We prospectively investigated multifetal pregnancy reduction in 13 women with triplet pregnancies in the first trimester following ovulation induction, in vitro fertilization, or gamete intrafallopian transfer procedures. Eleven women whose triplet pregnancies followed similar reproductive technologies and who declined or were not offered the procedure were managed expectantly. Mean (+/- standard deviation) infant birth weight was 2227 +/- 478 g in the multifetal reduction group and 2239 +/- 399 g in the group managed expectantly. Gestational age was 35.5 +/- 2.3 weeks in the study group and 35.7 +/- 2.5 weeks in the triplets managed expectantly. Newborn hospital days as well as newborn and maternal complications were not statistically different between the management groups. Maternal interventions included tocolytic medication, home uterine activity monitoring, and extended hospitalization, and were more common in the triplets managed expectantly than in the study group of triplets reduced to twins. Multifetal pregnancy reduction for triplet pregnancies does not necessarily improve pregnancy outcome, though it may be offered on the basis of parental choice.\r"

The mean duration of oxytocin infusion was 15 hours for induction of labor and 8.9 hours for augmentation. Thirty-four (92%) of the 37 women who received oxytocin induction and 44 (92%) of the 48 who had oxytocin for augmentation achieved at least 200 Montevideo units of uterine pressure. All 85 newborns were vigorous at birth and had no complications during their stay in the hospital nursery. Evaluation of uterine contraction pressure can provide a quantifiable end point for the management of oxytocin induction or augmentation of labor.\r"

The FHR analyses were used to guide management, but the results of the Doppler measurements were not made available to the clinical staff. The mean duration of each nonstress test (NST) was 27 minutes, compared with 6 minutes for the Doppler examination. Increased resistance indices in the umbilical artery identified those fetuses with an abnormal NST or a clinical diagnosis of antenatal distress with a high sensitivity and negative predictive value. The high rate of false-positive results with respect to these two end points was reduced when fetal distress in labor was included as a third end point. The value of the Doppler examination in predicting fetal distress was applicable to appropriately grown as well as small for gestational age fetuses.\r"

In the Doppler group, preliminary assessment was by umbilical artery resistance estimation, and in the fetal heart rate (FHR) group by computerized FHR analysis. To minimize the risk of failing to recognize fetal distress, the criteria for using the nonallocated method as well were deliberately conservative. Thus, 66% of the 1869 Doppler studies done in the Doppler group and 39% of the 2069 FHR tests done in the FHR group needed to be followed by the nonallocated tests. Trained nursing staff performed the Doppler studies as part of their routine duties. Doppler studies were unsuccessful in obtaining a result on 26% of the occasions. Under the above clinical circumstances, preliminary Doppler screening did not reduce the time taken for fetal assessment. There were no significant differences in perinatal outcome between the groups, except that emergency as opposed to elective cesareans were less frequent in the Doppler group. As this finding was not predicted by previous hypothesis, it needs to be confirmed.\r"

The mean umbilical artery systolic-diastolic ratio (S/D) was significantly higher in the pregnancies with subsequent abnormal perinatal outcomes than in those with normal outcomes (2.42 versus 2.19; P = .03). Using a receiver operating characteristic curve, an abnormal umbilical artery S/D was defined as 2.40 or greater. Using this value, sensitivity was 57.1% and specificity was 77.8%. Our study suggests that an umbilical artery S/D of 2.40, rather than the more traditionally accepted cutoff of 3.0, may be a useful threshold to identify those postdates pregnancies at high risk for abnormal perinatal outcome.\r"

The same calculations were then made on 39 prospectively matched non-aborting controls. We also determined the difference between sac size and crown-rump length in both groups. Significant differences were found for all three measures. Small-for-dates sac size and small-for-dates crown-rump length were defined as having a discrepancy score greater than 1 standard deviation (SD) above normal. Small-for-dates sac/crown-rump length was defined as having a discrepancy score less than 1 SD below normal. A high percentage of aborters was correctly predicted by a mean sac diameter (82%) or crown-rump length (77%) that was greater than +1 SD, with few false positives (12.8 and 5.1%, respectively). The cutoff for differences of sac minus crown-rump length measurements (10.1 mm) was less sensitive (56%), but just as specific (82%). When both the mean sac diameter and crown-rump length were smaller than expected (according to known date of ovulation), the ability to predict abortion was 71% with few false positives (3.5%).\r"

Comparisons of coefficient c values for six anatomical measurements indicated no statistically significant differences in the second-trimester growth of triplets, twins, and singletons. Third-trimester triplet values for HC, AC, and femur diaphysis length were predicted with an accuracy of +/- 6-8%. For thigh circumference and EFW, the comparable values were +/- 17 and +/- 15%, respectively. The HC at birth was predicted without bias; the random error was approximately -27 to 9.0%. Weight, AC, and thigh circumference were systematically overestimated (16.5, 20.9, and 16.3%, respectively). After correction for systematic errors, these characteristics could be predicted with random errors of -13.0 to 9.5% (weight), -12.0 to 2.8% (AC), and -16.7 to 11.3% (thigh circumference). Growth Potential Realization Index values had means of approximately 100% and ranges from 90-121%. The mean triplet value of the Neonatal Growth Assessment Score was 13.6, ranging from 2.8-26.5.

From 1982-1985, the reported perinatal mortality rates varied from 32-36 per 1000 live births, more than double the national average. Under the leadership of the Primary Health Care Consortium of Dade County (a federation of community health centers and other primary care providers), National Health Service Corps obstetricians and pediatricians served inner-city, medically needy patients as part of a coordinated perinatal plan from 1987-1989. Data on fetal and neonatal deaths, collected from census tracts adjacent to the community health centers, were used to study the impact of Corps obstetrician and pediatrician placement. The respective perinatal mortality rates were compared with those of 1986 as historic controls. Within a year, the overall perinatal mortality rate was reduced by 45%. As a result, an estimated 320 lives were saved between 1987-1989. This public health achievement represents a measurable impact due to assignment of National Health Service Corps physicians and can be used as a working model to reduce perinatal mortality in medically underserved communities in the United States.\r"

The vaginal cuff was closed with three interrupted 0-Dexon sutures in 30 and with absorbable staples in 30. Both groups were similar with respect to age, gravidity, parity, preoperative indication, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. The operative technique and quantity of irrigation used was standardized. Operative blood loss was calculated by the weight method and an unactivated, medium flat Jackson-Pratt drain was left in place for collecting postoperative cuff cultures at 24 and 48 hours. The mean operative times in the suture group (97.4 minutes) and staple group (93.4 minutes) were not significantly different (P greater than .05). Cuff-closure time was more rapid (P = .0001) in the staple group (5.8 minutes) than in the suture group (9.3 minutes). Intraoperative cultures were positive in eight of 30 suture patients (26.7%) and eight of 30 staple patients (26.7%). Postoperative cultures at either 24 or 48 hours were positive in four women (13.3%) in the suture group and six (20%) in the staple group. Febrile morbidity occurred in six (20%) in each group. Three staple and two suture subjects developed a vaginal cuff abscess or hematoma, one of whom was readmitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics and draining of the vaginal cuff abscess. The presence of a positive vaginal cuff culture did not predict clinical outcome. Based on these observations and the increased cost of the stapling device, we conclude that there is no significant clinical advantage of surgical staples over traditional sutures for vaginal cuff closure at abdominal hysterectomy.\r"

For the early detection of abnormalities, phase-specific normal ranges (reference areas) are displayed. In addition, protraction/arrest as well as precipitate labor disorders are highlighted and computer messages are displayed. The program was evaluated through the assessment of 405 labors entered into a local area network of computers. On average, the program identified 1.5 abnormalities per recorded labor (2.0 for labors resulting in vaginal delivery). The graphic presentation of the labor curve, produced within 3 seconds, displayed 27% more information than the tabular format on the same screen area and provided a single-screen display of the labor curve even for patients with excessive data. The computer-generated display of labor curves facilitates visual presentation and interpretation of labor progress and can also help to translate quality assurance criteria into clinical practice.\r"

Blood was seen leading away from the placenta in a case that progressed to an acute abruption. It was also seen in the region of the cervix in two patients with placenta previa. One patient had a normal MRI but had a fresh clot at delivery, which presumably formed after the imaging. In the remaining seven patients, MRI scans were negative and the placentas were normal at delivery. Our preliminary results suggest that MRI is helpful in evaluating patients with unexplained third-trimester bleeding.\r"

The purpose of this study was to compare the Finapres digital probe with oscillometric and arterial line devices for recording blood pressures in low- and high-risk pregnant women. A total of 38 women were studied, including 24 with pregnancy-induced hypertension, two with chronic hypertension, two with cardiac disease, and ten who had no risk factors but requested epidural catheter placement. The comparison of Finapres or oscillometric recordings with direct arterial values confirmed that systolic recordings were imprecise for both devices (r = 0.80 and r = 0.64, respectively). Diastolic recordings (Korotkoff sound, phase 4) from the Finapres were accurate compared with the arterial values (r = 0.84). The Finapres performed at least as reliably as the oscillometric monitor in assessing blood pressure in our pregnant population and provided continuous measurements. When very accurate systolic recordings are needed, arterial catheter placement may be necessary.\r"

We performed immunoperoxidase stains for beta-hCG, hPL, placental alkaline phosphatase, and keratin (AE1/AE3) on endometrial curettings of 72 patients with first-trimester bleeding in whom ectopic pregnancy was suspected based on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. Negative immunoperoxidase stains correlated with a retrospective patient chart review identified only ten patients with extrauterine pregnancy, a prevalence of 14%. The sensitivity of hCG, hPL, placental alkaline phosphatase, and keratin markers in detecting trophoblastic cells in the curettings was 42, 48, 24, and 69%, respectively. Each marker had a specificity of 100%. When both keratin and hPL were used, the sensitivity improved to 73%; however, there was no advantage in using three or more markers. We conclude that 73% of patients suspected to have ectopic pregnancy would be spared additional diagnostic techniques when immunoperoxidase markers for keratin and hPL are used on endometrial curettings without trophoblast on routine H&E stain. The procedure requires only 3 hours of laboratory time.\r"

Five women were referred with uncorrectable cyanotic heart disease and pulmonary hypertension. The mean preoperative arterial oxygen pressure was 56.2 +/- 5 mmHg (N = 5). After cardiology and cardiovascular anesthesia consultation and clearance, the patients underwent laparoscopic sterilization with Silastic rings under local anesthesia using direct trocar entry. Continuous hemodynamic monitoring and pulse oximetry were employed. The patients were kept in the intensive care unit or the hospital for 24 hours for monitoring, and all did well. This hospital for 24 hours for monitoring, and all did well. This small retrospective series demonstrates that laparoscopic sterilization under local anesthesia is a sterilization technique that may be suitable and safe for such patients when appropriate monitoring is performed. Tubal sterilization may be the contraceptive method of choice in women with heart disease when pregnancy is contraindicated.\r"

Both the unsleeved and sleeved Cytobrush demonstrated good sensitivity for detecting dysplasia within the endocervical canal (89 and 95%, respectively). The sleeved Cytobrush demonstrated greater specificity than the unsleeved Cytobrush (90 versus 60%; P less than .05). Compared with endocervical curettage, the Cytobrush used in conjunction with the described \"cytosleeve\" offers an inexpensive, less painful, and accurate method of determining endocervical involvement of dysplasia.\r"

The intussusception salpingostomy is undertaken by making a relatively short incision in the hydrosalpinx and then prolapsing the tubal mucosa through this neostium. The borders of the incision thus act as a restrictive collar to maintain the mucosa in this newly everted configuration. In a series of 40 women subjected to this procedure, 22 were followed for more than 12 months postoperatively; the term pregnancy rate was 22.7%. This fertility is similar to that after salpingostomy by microsurgical laparotomy.\r"

The frequency of these complications is particularly increased in patients with severe hypertension and those with preexisting cardiovascular and renal disease. Such women should receive appropriate antihypertensive therapy and frequent evaluations of maternal and fetal well-being. In contrast, in patients with mild essential chronic hypertension, the maternal and perinatal benefits from antihypertensive medications are highly controversial. A review of the literature revealed two placebo-controlled studies, four trials comparing treatment versus no medication, and three comparisons of methyldopa and oxprenolol. In only one of these studies were subjects randomized in the first trimester. No differences in pregnancy outcome were found with the use of antihypertensive drugs. Evaluation of the woman with chronic hypertension who is considering pregnancy should begin before conception to establish the cause and severity of the hypertension. Appropriate management should include frequent evaluation of maternal and fetal well-being; antihypertensive medications may be useful in patients with severe disease as well as in those with target organ involvement.\r"

  ".W": "Therapy of infertility rarely offers a clear end point for cessation after repeated failure. Yet fertility treatment, especially if repeatedly unsuccessful, is associated with economic as well as emotional cost. Stopping treatment becomes an increasingly important option for couples whose therapy does not produce the desired result. It is the clinician's obligation to make infertile couples aware of this option early in the treatment plan and to give specific suggestions that allow these couples to stop treatment at a medically arbitrary, yet temporally well-defined point. To this end, we suggest the following for infertile couples undergoing treatment: 1) an ongoing relationship with a qualified counselor; 2) the best estimates for pregnancy rates, including the background (treatment-independent) rate, for all forms of treatment available at any point in time; 3) the option of stopping treatment from the start; 4) encouragement to seek second opinions throughout treatment; 5) time off from treatment; and 6) the opportunity to set arbitrary but relatively firm time limits. Incorporation of these suggestions into the therapeutic plan for infertile couples underscores the imperfect nature of infertility treatment and acknowledges that sometimes the most we can do for our patients is to help them stop.\r"

The traditional concept of viability has proven an inadequate basis for extension of personal rights and protections to the fetus. Conservative interpretation of a proposed neurologic definition of human life would suggest that human life does not start until approximately 70 days post-conception. Standardization and widespread acceptance of a definition of \"brain life\" would potentially clarify many medical and legal questions regarding elective abortion and would parallel currently accepted medical and legal definitions of death.\r"

  ".W": "New York state has recently restricted the hours that residents may work to an average of 80 hours per week. We have complied with these regulations through the addition of nonresident personnel, including attending physicians, a physician assistant, and nurse midwives. This study was designed to assess the effect of these changes on our residents. A questionnaire covering the effects of our new system was distributed to both attending and resident staff. Surgical case load and Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology (CREOG) scores since the change were compared with those of previous years. A marked improvement in resident life-style was noted. Although residents commented that they had increased time for reading, this was not reflected in an improvement in the CREOG scores. The quality of patient care was not felt to be improved, and the continuity of care was considered to be adversely affected. Resident surgical case load was unchanged. The assignment of emergency room coverage to attending physicians and gynecologic floor coverage to a physician assistant was seen as having a detrimental effect on resident experience. We conclude that the new restrictions on resident work hours in New York have improved resident quality of life. However, there does not appear to be an improvement in patient care, which was the original intent of the statute. Concerns are discussed about the effect of this decrease in hours worked on resident experience and education. Further research is needed to assess the long-term effects of reduced resident work hours on both patient care and resident education.\r"

A control group of age and demographically matched men without history of back pain was also studied. Compared to controls, men with CLBP had significantly higher lifetime rates of major depression (32% vs. 16%), alcohol use disorder (64.9% vs. 38.8%), and a major anxiety disorder (30.9% vs. 14.3%). Almost all CLBP men ever experiencing a mood disorder reported recurrent, not single, episodes. The 6 month point prevalence of major depression, but not other disorders, was also significantly elevated for men with CLBP. In CLBP, the first episode of major depression generally (58.1%) followed pain onset. While the initial major depressive episode usually commenced within the first 2 years of established pain, late onset mood disorder was also common. By comparison in most cases (81%) onset of alcohol use disorders considerably preceded pain. When an age-matching procedure was used to gauge relative vulnerability to psychiatric illness in patients and controls, CLBP patients had significantly higher pre-pain rates of alcohol use disorder but not depression. After age of pain onset, CLBP subjects had over 9 times the risk of developing major depression, but had similar rates of developing alcoholism. We conclude that (1) alcohol use disorders rather than depression may increase risk of developing CLBP, and (2) risk of new onset and recurrent major depression remains high for men throughout their pain career. This suggests that psychological adaptation to long-standing pain may be less successful than previously thought, especially with regard to recurrent mood disorder.\r"

Patients above the median on the internality dimension of the PLOC reported their pain as less intense and frequent than those below the median. No differences were noted on the behavioral functioning measures. Results are consistent with previous studies and indicate an association between ability to control pain and variations in magnitude and periodicity of pain.

Experimental pain was induced by cold pressor test (CPT) in 8 male volunteers. Analgesic effect of hypnosis (HA) and acupuncture (AA) was assessed before and after double-blind administration of placebo or naloxone, in a prospective, cross-over study. We found that pain intensity was significantly lower with HA as compared with AA, both with naloxone (P less than 0.001) and placebo (P less than 0.001). Within HA or AA groups, pain scores did not differ significantly when naloxone or placebo was administered. During AA, however, pain scores were similar to control values when naloxone was given (P = 0.05) but decreased significantly with placebo (P less than 0.002). Analog scales for pain intensity and pain relief showed a good correlation (r = 0.94). Plasma levels of beta-endorphins did not change significantly in any combination. Heart rate, peripheral arterial blood pressure and skin conductance were very insensitive indices to assess pain intensity or relief, as well as intensity of acupuncture stimulation or depth of hypnotic trance. We conclude: (1) HA and AA can significantly reduce pain from CPT, and HA is more effective than AA: (2) HA and AA are not primarily mediated by the opiate endorphin system; and (3) plasmatic levels of beta-endorphins are not significantly affected by either HA or AA nor by naloxone or placebo administration.\r"

Two methods were employed: percutaneously implanted catheter (175 patients) and subcutaneous reservoirs (50 patients). In the 225 patients, the mean duration of implantation of the peridural catheter was 47.3 days (7-420 days), the mean daily dose of morphine was 13.4 +/- 6.9 (5-80 mg) delivered by 2.6 +/- 0.7 (1-8) injections. The mean duration of action was calculated to be 9.3 +/- 3.8 h (3-32 h). Satisfactory analgesia was achieved in 133 patients (59.1%) in whom peridural morphine was the sole analgesic treatment. Peridural morphine appeared to be especially effective in patients with pain arising in the abdominal region. Complications due to morphine and the catheter were evaluated.\r"

We reviewed the postsurgical records of 320 patients for pre-established criteria on the administration of meperidine before and after detailing of the proper prescribing with regard to timing and dose. The data show 30% of the sample meeting the criteria before detailing and 43% after detailing had been given.

  ".U": "91343320\r", 
  ".W": "We report behaviours suggesting the presence of allodynia elicited by non-noxious brushing and mechanical pressure following photochemically induced ischaemic spinal cord injury in the rat. Female rats were intravenously injected with Erythrosin B and the T10 vertebra was irradiated with a laser beam for 1, 5 or 10 min. These procedures initiated an intravascular photochemical reaction, resulting in ischaemic spinal cord injury. After irradiation a clear allodynia was observed in most rats. The animals vocalized intensely to light touch during gentle handling and were clearly agitated to light brushing of the flanks. The vocalization threshold in response to the mechanical pressure measured with von Frey hairs was markedly decreased during this period. In some animals the existence of spontaneous pain was suggested by spontaneous vocalization. The duration of the allodynia varied among animals from several hours to several days. The severity and duration of allodynia seemed not to be related to the duration of irradiation. In sham-operated rats a slight, transient allodynia was also noted around the wound within a few hours after surgery, which was effectively relieved by systemic morphine (2 mg/kg, i.p.). Morphine (2 mg/kg, i.p.) also partially relieved the allodynia in spinally injured rats 4 h after irradiation. However, morphine, even at a higher dose (5 mg/kg, i.p.), failed to alleviate the allodynia in spinally injured rats 24-48 h after the injury. Systemic injection of the GABAB agonist baclofen (0.01-0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), but not the GABAA agonist muscimol (1 mg/kg, i.p.), effectively relieved allodynia during this period. Pretreatment with guanethidine 24 h and just prior to the irradiation (20 mg/kg, s.c.) did not prevent the occurrence of allodynia in spinal cord injured rats. The present observation is the first to show that ischaemic spinal cord injury could result in cutaneous mechanical allodynia. This phenomenon is resistant to morphine and may not involve the sympathetic system. Histological examination of allodynic animals 3 days after spinal cord injury revealed considerable morphological damage in the dorsal spinal cord of a rat irradiated for 5 min. The related dorsal roots were also slightly affected in this animal, while the dorsal root ganglia were normal. However, in rats irradiated for 1 min, despite the existence of strong allodynia, no damage could be found at this time in the spinal cord, dorsal roots or dorsal root ganglia. It is suggested that functional deficits in the GABAB system in the spinal cord may be related to this allodynia-like phenomenon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Response and receptive field properties were evaluated for 62 spinomesencephalic tract cells in the upper cervical spinal cord (C1-C3) of cats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and alpha-chloralose. Recordings were made from cells in laminae I-VIII and X contralateral to antidromic stimulating electrodes positioned in the rostral, caudal and intercollicular region of the midbrain. The mean antidromic threshold for all cells was 185 +/- 132 microA, and conduction velocities ranged from 2.3 to 38.6 m/sec. Twelve cells were backfired from both midbrain and diencephalic stimulation sites. Receptive fields ranged from simple, i.e., ipsilateral forelimb or face, to complex, i.e., excitatory and/or inhibitory responses from large portions of the body. Peripheral receptive fields included muscles, joints, cornea, dura, forelimbs, hind limbs, tail, and/or testicles. Five functional classes of cells were observed: (a) wide dynamic range (14 cells); (b) high threshold (2 cells): (c) low threshold (4 cells); (d) deep/tap (11 cells); and (e) non-responsive (31 cells). Eight cells were evaluated for responses to different doses (5-150 micrograms) of intravenous (i.v.) serotonin. Two of the 8 cells exhibited excitatory effects, whereas 2 cells classified as deep/tap and 4 cells classified as non-responsive were not affected. The results of this study have shown the upper cervical component of the spinomesencephalic tract is made up of a heterogenous population of cells involved in the integration of varied inputs from large portions of the body. It is proposed that the large population of SMT cells in the upper cervical spinal cord may be involved in pain mechanisms, especially those related to the affective consequences of acute and chronic pain.\r"

EPSPs and spikes were evoked in STT neurons with short latencies ranging from 0.4 to 5.3 msec after the corticospinal volley, indicating a monosynaptic connection in at least some STT neurons. Spatial and temporal summation seem necessary for the cortex to maintain an effective excitatory influence on STT neurons. It is postulated that the cortical facilitation of STT neurons helps them to acquire more nociceptive signals during behavioral tasks such as exploring a new object so that the brain can make decisions about whether to continue or to abandon a certain task. Possible implications for central pain states are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "91343323\r", 
  ".W": "An interesting behavioral syndrome results in animals from the same or similar types of lesions that lead to deafferentation pain in humans; many neurectomized animals begin to scratch, bite, or self-mutilate their denervated limb, a phenomenon termed autotomy. The proposition that this behavior in animals is a response to the chronic pain of peripheral nerve injury has met with considerable controversy. If this issue were resolved, then a better understanding of the neurophysiology of autotomy might help elucidate the mechanisms of the human conditions. To determine the association between deafferentation and the autotomy behavior, we developed a pharmacologically induced functional deafferentation preparation using chronic perineural lidocaine infusion of the sciatic nerve. This 'chronic lidocaine' model's behavior was compared with that of the neurectomy model. While autotomy was noted in 80% of the latter group, no animal undergoing a chronic perineural infusion of lidocaine autotomized. We thus conclude that autotomy is not a response to non-painful sensory deafferentation, but rather that this behavior is a response to pain. We also studied the development of autotomy in a variety of other focal denervation preparations. On the basis of these data, we conclude that autotomy is not due to loss of sensory input on a functional basis nor to an action potential-mediated process. Rather, nerve damage which coincidentally involves sensory loss is necessary and sufficient for the development of this behavior. We suggest that interruption of a humoral feedback process homeostatically operating within the first order sensory neuron with its effect exerted post-synaptically leads to autotomy. The evidence supports the existence of a loss of a transportable, humoral autotomy inhibitory factor.\r"

In the late phase, the licking activity was much lower at 20 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. Both the intensity and the duration of the response were increased by increasing the ambient temperature from 20 degrees C to 28 degrees C. 5,6-Dihydroxytryptamine lesions of descending serotonergic pathways induced an increase in the nociceptive response at an ambient temperature of 20 degrees C, while the response was no different from control values at 25 degrees C. Differences in paw skin temperature may explain these temperature dependent effects. It was concluded that control of the ambient temperature is necessary to obtain reliable results in the formalin test, late phase.\r"

Surprisingly, there has been little placebo-controlled investigation of its efficacy for altering either clinical or experimental pain perception. The current study compared the effects of DCS to placebo stimulation on clinical pain perception, perceived intensity of painful heat stimuli and visual stimuli, and the discrimination of small changes in noxious heat intensity and in light intensity. We found that DCS, but not placebo stimulation, significantly altered ratings of spontaneous clinical pain as well as those of painful cutaneous heat. In addition, heat discrimination thresholds were increased by DCS, but not placebo. On the other hand, DCS had no effect on ratings of visual stimulus intensity nor on visual discrimination, suggesting that the DCS modulation of pain perception was not due to a general change in attention. These data indicate that DCS significantly alters pain transmission in humans. Nevertheless, the relatively small reduction in clinical pain (less than 30%) must be weighed against the invasive nature of electrode implantation.\r"

The magnitude and inverse latency of withdrawal, although variable, increased exponentially as a functions of stimulus temperature. The stimulus response functions for mean withdrawal magnitude and mean pain intensity were similar for lower stimulus temperatures, but at higher temperatures the withdrawal continued to increase exponentially whereas pain intensity reached a plateau. The pain intensity and withdrawal magnitude for each stimulus were poorly correlated. Under the conditions of this experiment, mean pain intensity and mean withdrawal magnitude were both well correlated with stimulus temperature, but the magnitude of withdrawal did not reliably reflect the intensity of pain sensation.\r"

The sural nerve compound action potential (CAP), the spinal withdrawal reflex (RIII), the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and subjective magnitude ratings were elicited by electrical stimulation of the sural nerve in 10 healthy subjects. The sural nerve CAP was used to normalize the evoking stimulus current and to help identify the peripheral nerve afferent types contributing to the physiological and psychophysical responses. Normalizing stimulus current to a proportion of that which elicited a just maximal sural nerve CAP significantly reduced individual variability in magnitude ratings, the RIII and the SEP. Pain and RIII responses only occurred at stimulus levels that were greater than or equal to 1.5 x that which produced a just maximal sural nerve CAP and both responses were positively related to stimulus intensity above that level. Activity in the large diameter A beta fibers will be saturated at stimulus levels near that which produced a just maximal CAP, which implies that both the pain and RIII responses can be attributed to recruitment of the smaller diameter A delta fibers. Although the amplitudes of the P200 and P300 peaks of the SEP were significantly related to stimulation at noxious levels, both were also affected by stimulation at innocuous levels. This result implies that these peaks receive contributions from both noxious and innocuous somatosensory processes. Clearly, the non-pain-related components of these SEP peaks must be identified and isolated before their potential in measuring supraspinal nociceptive processes can be fully realized.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether the novel, potent and highly selective 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist ICS 205-930 can prevent migraine attacks, we conducted simultaneously two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, international trials, involving a total of 204 patients, suffering from classic or common migraine. Both trials had the same parallel-group design (1 month baseline observation, followed by 3 months treatment) and both produced remarkably similar results. The primary efficacy parameter was the proportional reduction in attack frequency recorded after 3 months of treatment. Twenty-two patients withdrew prematurely from the trials and could not be assessed for efficacy. Mild to severe constipation was reported by about 50% of the patients on active treatment. None of the doses of ICS 205-930 tested (50 mg, 25 mg and 15 mg daily) produced a statistically significantly better result to reduce attack frequency than did placebo. However, confidence intervals for the difference in effect with placebo were wide, indicating that 15 mg ICS 205-930 may produce a 57% reduction in attack frequency as compared to placebo. The most unusual finding was that, for all efficacy parameters, the best results were obtained with the lowest dose (15 mg), the worst results with the highest dose (50 mg) and an intermediate effect with 25 mg. Such an inverse relation between dose and efficacy suggests a bell-shaped dose-response curve, implying that doses lower than 15 mg might well prove to be more effective. Thus, the present study has produced inconclusive, but intriguing results. Lower doses should be further investigated before drawing any definite conclusion on the efficacy of ICS 205-930 in the prophylactic treatment of migraine.\r"

A picture book was used to prepare half of the children for the procedure. Preparation was carried out just prior to sampling and took less than 5 min. The story provided a simple description of venous blood sampling, and why it is carried out; it stressed that the pain is noticeable but not unbearable, and that children will experience less pain if they relax their arm and cooperate with the technician. Prepared children reported significantly less pain, and radial pulse rates confirmed that they were less distressed by the procedure. Observers' and parents' evaluations also indicated that prepared children coped better. Various explanations for the benefits observed are discussed, together with requirements for managing the pain, fear and stress experienced by children during medical treatment.\r"

  ".U": "91343338\r", 
  ".W": "In a previous report we presented a novel behavioral model of neuropathic pain disorders, produced in rat by a unilateral ligation of about half of the sciatic nerve. The model is characterized by rapid onset of behaviors suggesting spontaneous pain and disordered responses to non-noxious and noxious stimuli. These include reduced withdrawal thresholds to repetitive touch in the partially deafferented skin ('touched-evoked hyperesthesia'), touch-evoked allodynia, reduced withdrawal thresholds to noxious thermal stimuli and exaggerated responses to noxious heat and mechanical stimuli ('thermal hyperalgesia'). Some of these disorders are seen at mirror image sites on the hind limb opposite the lesion. These disorder start within hours after partial nerve injury, last many months and are very similar to causalgia in humans following partial nerve injury. Since sympathetic efferent activity is known to aggravate causalgia in humans and sympathectomy is known to relieve it, we studied the effect of changing sympathetic outflow in the rat model. Reversible sympathectomy was carried out using guanethidine injected intraperitoneally in 3 experiments, each at a different time in relation to the partial nerve injury. We found that: (1) sympathectomy performed several months postoperatively alleviated the sensory disorders bilaterally; (2) sympathectomy prior to nerve injury partially prevented the appearance of thermal hyperalgesia but did not affect hyperesthesia to repetitive touch; and (3) sympathectomy at the time of nerve injury aggravated the sensory disorders during the first few days. As maintenance and production of the sensory disorders in this animal model depended on sympathetic nervous outflow, we conclude that the rats were suffering from a syndrome analogous to sympathetically maintained causalgia in man.\r"

Serotonin (methysergide, LY 53857 or ICS 205-930), adrenergic (prazosin or yohimbine) or opioid (naloxone, nor-binaltorphimine or naltrindole) receptor antagonists were administered into the subarachnoid space of the lumbar enlargement to characterize the spinal receptors mediating VAS-produced facilitation. Spinal 5-HT1 and kappa-opioid receptors were determined to be involved in facilitation of the TF reflex produced by VAS, suggesting that facilitation of spinal nociceptive transmission by activation of cervical vagal afferents is mediated by subtypes of spinal serotonergic and opioid receptors.\r"

A retrospective analysis of all cases of P. aeruginosa skin infections seen at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital since 1962 revealed 16 episodes of the infection (ecthyma gangrenosum, 8 episodes, 7 patients; cellulitis, 8 episodes, 7 patients) in which blood cultures were uniformly negative for P. aeruginosa. All cases were identified while the patients were receiving ambulatory care. Five episodes developed while the patients' neutrophil counts were greater than 1 x 10(9) cells/liter. Eight patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 2 had acute myeloid leukemia, 2 had aplastic anemia, 1 had transient agranulocytosis and 1 had cyclic neutropenia. There were no solid tumor patients. Although patients received different antibiotic combinations, all had resolutions of their lesions without fatal complications. Patients diagnosed as having cellulitis required a mean of 9.2 days of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, as compared with 17.8 days for those with ecthyma gangrenosum (P less than 0.05 by the Wilcoxon test). These observations show that P. aeruginosa skin infections can develop in the absence of bacteremia in immunocompromised children.\r"

Forty-two children were enrolled, assigned to treatment with active drug or placebo and then examined at 2-week intervals. They received TMP-SMX (or placebo) during the first 2 weeks, TMP-SMX and prednisone (or placebo) during Weeks 3 and 4 for persistent OME and TMP-SMX (or placebo) for Weeks 5 and 6 if OME was still unresolved. After treatment 48% of active drug and 14% of placebo subjects resolved OME bilaterally (P less than 0.05). Active drug subjects also had fewer acute otitis media episodes than placebo subjects while receiving study treatment (P less than 0.01). Although this treatment regimen produced short term OME resolution, long term benefits were not demonstrated.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the incidence of bacteremia in pediatric cancer patients with indwelling central venous catheters with fever, we reviewed the records of all 67 such patients sequentially admitted during a 10-month period at our institution. There were a total of 140 episodes of fever in these 67 patients. In 55 of the episodes (39%) patients were nonneutropenic (absolute neutrophil count, greater than 500/mm3); 85 episodes (61%) were associated with neutropenia. Twenty-four percent of all episodes of fever in nonneutropenic patients were related to bacteremia vs. 9.5% of episodes of fever in the presence of neutropenia (P less than 0.05). When clinical evidence of an exit site infection was absent, the incidence of bacteremia in the neutropenic and nonneutropenic groups was similar (11% in the neutropenic group; 10% in the nonneutropenic group). We conclude that bacteremia is frequently observed in febrile pediatric cancer patients with indwelling venous catheters who are not neutropenic, particularly if there is clinical evidence of an exit site infection. Thus empiric antibiotic therapy is warranted in all pediatric oncology patients with indwelling catheters who develop fever.\r"

Both community-acquired and nosocomial cases occurred during autumn, winter and early spring. The attack rates during outbreaks ranged between 7 and 62% and were highest among children with underlying gastrointestinal diseases. Diarrhea and vomiting were the most common clinical manifestations. The median duration of symptoms was 4 days and that of virus excretion was 5 days. Hospital infection with astroviruses is common and usually affects children less than 2 years of age. The probable mode of transmission is spread via contaminated hands.\r"

Three hundred ninety-four problems were found: 24% were preventable by improved education of referring doctors; these included unrecognized needs for ventilatory support, added oxygen, chest x-ray or nasogastric tube, and difficulties with airway selection, placement, and care. Twenty-eight percent were preventable by better PETS organization, education, protocols, or telephone checklists; examples include equipment problems and clinical derangements unrecognized at referral. Difficulties owing to conditions of transport (eg. vibration, dysbarism, and air turbulence) were uncommon (five percent of patients). Regular reviews of performance of all PET services, combined with measures to educate referring doctors, can improve patient outcome.\r"

Communications were characterized as complaint or compliment and subclassified by type: waiting time, staff attitude, quality of medical care, and billing. Chi 2 analysis was used to identify factors that predisposed to complaint or compliment and to identify the subtype. After quality-of-care issues, complaints stemmed most often from billing issues or waiting time for care for nonurgent disorders (especially medical problems), while complimentary letters most frequently addressed staff attitude and quality of care. The problems that we identified might be addressed by providing families improved access to non-emergency department care sources, education regarding the role of an emergency department, and better explanation of billing procedures during the registration process. Additionally, our findings serve as a reminder that many parents appreciate the care given to their children, particularly for life-threatening emergencies.\r"

Ingestions and toxic substance exposures were studied in two prospective cohorts in Hawaii to examine the epidemiology of these events in this community in order to assess the effectiveness of current poison prevention practices and to identify additional measures to further prevent and reduce morbidity and mortality. During a 12-month period ending on 11/30/88, data were collected on 286 pediatric patients visiting a pediatric ED with an ingestion or a toxic substance exposure. Most of the younger children were males with unintentional incidents. Most of the adolescents were females with intentional ingestions. Syrup of ipecac was given in 16% of the patients. When given at home, ipecac was given an average of 1.3 hours after an ingestion. Activated charcoal was given to 32% of the patients. During a 13-month period ending 1/31/90, 14,408 phone calls to the Hawaii Poison Center were analyzed. Twenty-six percent of the callers had ipecac at home. Sixty-eight percent of callers with acute ingestions claimed to have called within 30 minutes of the ingestion, and 77% claimed to have called within 60 minutes of the ingestion. Of those calling within 60 minutes, 36% had ipecac at home. Although ipecac is widely recommended as a pre-hospital intervention, it use is limited owing to unavailability in the home and the short period of time during which it must be given. Since the dispensing of pharmaceuticals in limited quantities and in childproof containers began, it appears that other measures to further reduce morbidity and mortality owing to poisonings have had less additional effect. It appears that serious morbidity and mortality from poisonings in this cohort were uncommon.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that the addition of human serum albumin to neonatal serum decreases the serum ionized calcium (iCa) concentration. Concentrated human serum albumin was added to 12 placental and cord serum samples to reach seven incremental concentrations from 0 to 20.0 g/L. Serum iCa concentration decreased significantly with the addition of serum albumin. From multiple regression analysis, the effect of albumin addition on serum iCa concentration had more marked effects at high baseline albumin or low baseline Ca concentrations. From this in vitro study, we speculate that fast infusion of albumin in human neonates has the potential for acutely lowering serum iCa concentration.\r"

  ".W": "By presenting the salient aspects of a case study of a high school student athlete, we have attempted to show how participation in sports can negatively impact on self-concept, self-esteem, physical acceptance, and self-efficacy, thereby contributing to an overall feeling of inadequacy, helplessness, hopelessness, and ultimately leading to depression and chronic fatigue. An early maturer, this student experienced early success in several sports without a great deal of effort and investment, and derived much of his sense of being from the recognition and reinforcement accorded him by significant others, most notably from a father who placed a higher premium on success in athletics than on other equally worthwhile pursuits. When continued success was not forthcoming, and as later-maturing peers caught up to and surpassed his athletic accomplishments, the student sought to protect his sense of self-esteem by rationalizing that his lack of success was due to a physical problem. He became obsessed with the thought that he was gradually losing his athletic identity and he lapsed deeper and deeper into a depressed state. His compulsive overtraining and starvation diet failed to produce his image of the \"ideal body\" that, of course, was unachievable because of his distorted view of reality. Ultimately, this behavior resulted in hospitalization for treatment of an eating disorder and clinical depression. Even a successful senior football season after his psychiatric care could not filter through his distorted perceptions and he could not cope with the thought of participating in another track and field season and having his performance bested by others whom he had once handily beaten. Thus, once again, he engaged in self-protective behavior and sought verification from sportsmedicine professionals. Diagnosis of Tom's condition was possible only through the collaborative efforts of the athletic trainer, physical therapist, sport psychologist, and family physician. Professionals involved in sportsmedicine must be aware of the critical role that highly valued activities like sports play in the psychosocial development of adolescents. To the adult, these activities may seem trivial, frivolous, and removed from the \"real world,\" but to the adolescent, they are an important source of self-esteem during a critical and volatile period of self-concept edification. During a period of awakening sexuality and heightened awareness of their physical being, activities that emphasize the physical aspect of self gain prominence. Those who derive positive experiences benefit from enhanced feelings of physical self-efficacy and self-esteem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The well trained athlete also demonstrates a personality that may be somewhat rigid, is strongly goal oriented, and strives for excellence. It is not unrealistic to expect that when confronted with diminished performance or success, athletes may be compelled to drive themselves harder to succeed. Such behavior typically leads to the phenomenon of overtraining, which can express itself in the form of chronic fatigue and depression. A number of other organic causes of chronic fatigue and depression must be excluded by careful evaluation and appropriate diagnostic testing. Although the evaluation of the athlete who presents with chronic fatigue and depression can be somewhat complex, a diagnostic framework has been outlined that may assist the clinician in the assessment of the athlete who presents with such complaints.\r"

They may precede the onset of myocardial infarction, singly or together, and increase the morbidity and mortality of patients with a history of MI. Virtually all such patients have a transient depression, usually accompanied by anxiety, with onset soon after hospitalization. Although this depression is transient and usually abates spontaneously, it frequently warrants therapeutic intervention. Psychosocial and personality factors play a significant role in the recovery of a patient with a cardiac condition. The clinician must be alert for the effects of changing roles within the family and behaviors that may lead to chronic invalidism. Anxiety disorders, often combined with depression, may mimic cardiac disease and may result from it, leading to chronic fatigue and weakness. Proper diagnosis usually leads to considerable improvement. Cardiac drugs, in addition to many others, may produce depression and fatigue that may be misdiagnosed. Often, discontinuing or changing a medication will lead to marked diminution of such symptoms. Observational and listening skills are key ingredients of the \"art\" of medicine; they can lead to interventions that are not only therapeutic, but which improve the \"quality\" of life.\r"

The role of physicians who can support or discourage beliefs about physical illness is all important, both by what they say and how they treat. In the process of interaction, they can promote or discourage disability. The role of the physician in the workplace is to determine if an illness is work related, if it is disabling, if it requires treatment, and what treatment. The physician must advise if the worker can continue in his or her usual and customary employment and, if not, if he or she can be vocationally rehabilitated from a medical standpoint. Conditions in which physical symptoms are unsupported by physical findings and have diagnostic labels that describe the disorder without indicating either cause or pathology are especially troubling for the physician who must decide if the patient's job caused the symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "Fatigue, pain, and emotional upset remain the most common problems affecting humanity and for which we still know so very little. Chronic fatigue syndrome is most likely a number of as yet unproven various undifferentiated illnesses that are exceedingly difficult to distinguish from depression. There probably is a subset of patients with CFS who do have true immune dysfunction and persistent viral infection, and this particular group of patients should be further investigated. This group is the minority of patients who present with chronic fatigue. Although chronic fatigue syndrome may be the result of an organic illness in psychologically susceptible individuals, it remains most important to assess underlying psychologic factors that then need to be addressed. These factors may very likely have a profound effect on immune function, but more research is needed in this area. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome should initially focus on causes for fatigue other than Epstein-Barr viral infection. Significant underlying medical conditions should be ruled out, and extensive inquiry into symptoms suggestive of depression and anxiety should be aggressively pursued. Treatment should include psychiatric support and counseling, good nutrition, adequate rest, and a gradual increase in activity. Anti-inflammatory agents and serotonin-replenishing antidepressants are helpful when muscle pain and tenderness are a major part of the patient's symptoms. Psychoactive drugs are useful when indicated. Low doses of antidepressants such as doxepin (10-25 mg at night) are generally well tolerated and have shown efficacy in numerous patients, although there are no reports of controlled trials.\r"

  ".W": "Recurrent major depression is an underdiagnosed, undertreated mood disorder that affects approximately 10 million Americans. Although the tricyclic antidepressants are the oldest and best studied class of antidepressant medications available, their use is routinely compromised by unsatisfactory pharmacokinetic and side-effect profiles. The newer antidepressant medications have longer half-lives and are less likely to produce side effects. The prototypes of the newer antidepressants are bupropion (Wellbutrin) and fluoxetine (Prozac). Fluoxetine distinguishes itself in that its half-life is 2 to 3 days, whereas the mean half-life of buproprion and the tricyclics are 10 to 14 hours. For this reason, fluoxetine is routinely administered once daily in the morning. Both of these agents bind to the cholinergic, histaminergic, and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors with minimal affinity, and are less likely to yield clinically significant side effects. The use of the newer antidepressants has led to improved patient compliance and physician acceptance.\r"

The alpha subunit of GABP contains an 85-amino acid segment related to the Ets family of DNA binding proteins. The ETS domain of GABP alpha facilitates weak binding to DNA and, together with an adjacent segment of 37 amino acids, mediates stable interaction with GABP beta. The beta subunit of GABP contains four imperfect repeats of a sequence present in several transmembrane proteins including the product of the Notch gene of Drosophila melanogaster. These amino-terminal repeats of GABP beta mediate stable interaction with GABP alpha and, when complexed with GABP alpha, directly contact DNA. These observations provide evidence for a distinct biochemical role for the 33-amino acid repeats, and suggest that they may serve as a module for the generation of specific dimerization interfaces.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of the V(D)J [variable (diversity) joining elements] recombination activating genes, RAG-1 and RAG-2, has been examined during T cell development in the thymus. In situ hybridization to intact thymus and RNA blot analysis of isolated thymic subpopulations separated on the basis of T cell receptor (TCR) expression demonstrated that both TCR- and TCR+ cortical thymocytes express RAG-1 and RAG-2 messenger RNA's. Within the TCR+ population, RAG expression was observed in immature CD4+CD8+ (double positive) cells, but not in the more mature CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+ (single positive) subpopulations. Thus, although cortical thymocytes that bear TCR on their surface continue to express RAG-1 and RAG-2, it appears that the expression of both genes is normally terminated during subsequent thymic maturation. Since thymocyte maturation in vivo is thought to be regulated through the interaction of the TCR complex with self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, these data suggest that signals transduced by the TCR complex might result in the termination of RAG expression. Consistent with this hypothesis, thymocyte TCR cross-linking in vitro led to rapid termination of RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression, whereas cross-linking of other T cell surface antigens such as CD4, CD8, or HLA class I had no effect.\r"

Characterization of the dehydrase enzyme of flaxseed revealed that it is a 55-kilodalton hemoprotein. The spectral characteristics of this dehydrase revealed it to be a cytochrome P-450. It operates with the remarkable activity of greater than or equal to 1000 turnovers per second.

Interruption of darkness by 2 hours of light prevented cyst formation, even when the overall duration of light was the same as in cyst-inducing short days. When given in a noninducing photoperiod, melatonin and an analog, 5-methoxytryptamine, substances that had previously been shown to occur in Gonyaulax, provoked cyst formation. Methoxylated indoleamines may play a role as mediators of darkness in this unicellular, in a similar way as in vertebrates, suggesting a common biochemical basis of photoperiodism.\r"

These alterations also occur, with a delay, after sensory axons are injured under conditions in which synaptic transmission is severely reduced. The latency and specificity of injury-induced alterations indicate that induction signals are generated at the site of injury and conveyed centrally by axonal transport. Similarities in neuronal modifications support the hypothesis that some memory mechanisms evolved from mechanisms of injury-induced sensory compensation and repair.\r"

  ".W": "The three-dimensional structure of acetylcholinesterase from Torpedo californica electric organ has been determined by x-ray analysis to 2.8 angstrom resolution. The form crystallized is the glycolipid-anchored homodimer that was purified subsequent to solubilization with a bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. The enzyme monomer is an alpha/beta protein that contains 537 amino acids. It consists of a 12-stranded mixed beta sheet surrounded by 14 alpha helices and bears a striking resemblance to several hydrolase structures including dienelactone hydrolase, serine carboxypeptidase-II, three neutral lipases, and haloalkane dehalogenase. The active site is unusual because it contains Glu, not Asp, in the Ser-His-acid catalytic triad and because the relation of the triad to the rest of the protein approximates a mirror image of that seen in the serine proteases. Furthermore, the active site lies near the bottom of a deep and narrow gorge that reaches halfway into the protein. Modeling of acetylcholine binding to the enzyme suggests that the quaternary ammonium ion is bound not to a negatively charged \"anionic\" site, but rather to some of the 14 aromatic residues that line the gorge.\r"

Some studies have suggested that protein polymorphisms are not neutral, but their significance has been questioned because one cannot eliminate the possibility that linked loci were responsible for the observed differences. Evidence is presented that an enzymatic phenotype can affect carbon flow through a metabolic pathway. Glucose flux differences between lactate dehydrogenase-B phenotypes of Fundulus heteroclitus were reversed by substituting the Ldh-B gene product of one homozygous genotype with that of another.\r"

Mammalian RNA polymerase II specifically protected a serine residue in the sigma 70-related region of RAP30 from phosphorylation in vitro. In addition, human RAP30/74 bound to Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and was displaced by sigma 70.

A revised model of coagulation is proposed in which factor XI is activated by thrombin. In the absence of cofactors, thrombin is more effective (kcat/Km = 1.6 x 10(5)) than factor XIIa (1.7 x 10(4)) in activating factor XI. Dextran sulfate enhances activation of factor XI by thrombin 2000-fold; part of this effect is due to autoactivation of factor XI by activated factor XI.\r"

After NMDA receptor activation, calcium entry into the postsynaptic neuron is a critical initial event. However, the subsequent mechanisms by which the NMDA receptor signal is processed are incompletely understood. Stimulation of cultured rat hippocampal cells with glutamate resulted in the rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of a 39-kilodalton protein (p39). Tyrosine phosphorylation of p39 was triggered by the NMDA receptor and required an influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium. Because p39 was found to be highly related or identical to the microtubule-associated protein 2 kinase, the NMDA receptor signal may be processed by a sequential activation of protein kinases.\r"

The right/left hemispheric ratio was 1.05 +/- 0.02 in the normothermic group and 1.00 +/- 0.02 in the hypothermic group (p less than 0.05).

  ".U": "91344112\r", 
  ".W": "Optimal management of cervical cord injury in the presence of documented instability and/or compression of neural elements remains a controversial topic. Surgery and internal stabilization of cervical spine fracture/dislocations are effective and well accepted, but controversy exists on the relative merits of the anterior versus the posterior approach as well as the optimal timing of surgical intervention. We report our experience with the Caspar technique and instrumentation for anterior stabilization in 54 patients for acute cervical spine injury. Our series consists of 38 male and 16 female patients whose ages ranged from 16 to 68 years, with a mean age of 29.2 years. Thirty-two of these patients had complete neurological sensory/motor deficits at the time of presentation, eight were neurologically intact, and 14 had preservation of some motor and sensory function. All 54 patients had radiographic evidence of posterior instability as well as anterior disruption of either a vertebral body or intervertebral disk. We found that \"early\" intervention (less than 24 hours after injury) was performed frequently in the neurologically compromised patients. Twelve of the 22 patients undergoing surgery less than 24 hours after admission regained significant neurological function, with 13 of 22 developing postoperative complications. In the \"delayed\" group (surgery more than 24 hours after injury, mean 14.3 days), 14 patients experienced postoperative complications, with 15 of 24 demonstrating neurological improvement. The eight patients who were intact did uniformly well. There was no mortality during the follow-up. All 54 patients showed a solid fusion (clinically and radiologically) within 6 months of surgery. In two cases the plates had to be removed, without risking the fusion. Our experience suggests that although anterior cervical fusion and Caspar plating remain appropriate for patients with documented anterior compromise of the canal, it should not substitute for more traditional posterior stabilization procedures. Because this route has the potential for more serious complications, it should be reserved for the cases in which anterior decompression is deemed necessary or posterior fusion was unsuccessful. With appropriate selection of patients, no adverse effect of early surgery was demonstrated. In fact, neurologically compromised patients had the benefits of increased ease of patient care and early transfer to rehabilitation.\r"

The mean numbers of Ag-NORs in GFAP-positive cells and GFAP-negative cells of high-grade gliomas were 2.68 and 3.74, respectively. The value of GFAP-negative cells was significantly greater than that of GFAP-positive cells (p less than 0.01). Our results show that, by means of the immunocytochemistry for GFAP, tumor cells in human high-grade gliomas can be divided into two groups expressing GFAP or not, and that the mean number of Ag-NORs of GFAP-negative cells is more representative of the degree of histological malignancy than that of positive cells. It is considered that the proliferative assessment of GFAP-negative tumor cells in high-grade gliomas by combined staining of Ag-NOR silver staining and GFAP immunocytochemistry is useful for understanding the histological malignancy of high-grade gliomas.\r"

In the control group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated. In the hypertensive group, the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg immediately after reestablishment of MCA patency. The area of neuronal injury, determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining, was significantly smaller in the hypertensive group. Specific gravity, determined by microgravimetry, did not differ between groups. The data demonstrate that modest hypertension, when induced during reperfusion after 2 hours of MCA occlusion, reduces neuronal injury and does not exacerbate edema formation.\r"

Our case is felt to support the hypothesis of a congenital origin for dural arteriovenous malformation in the anterior cranial fossa, because the dural arteriovenous malformation coexisted with the mixed pial and dural arteriovenous malformation, which can be attributed to a disturbance of normal embryonic development.\r"

  ".W": "The exclusion of bone metastases is important in the initial staging of non-small cell lung cancer, though there is debate about whether bone scans should be performed routinely or restricted to patients who present with clinical or laboratory indicators suggesting skeletal metastases. In a prospective study of 110 consecutive patients referred for initial staging of non-small cell lung cancer, we assessed the sensitivity of a group of clinical indicators (chest pain, skeletal pain, bone tenderness on physical examination, serum alkaline phosphatase, and serum calcium) for the presence of skeletal metastases as determined by bone scanning. The final staging result was validated with follow up data over at least three years. At the initial staging 37 of 110 bone scans (34%) showed areas of increased uptake, of which only nine were confirmed to be metastases (by tomography, computed tomography, or biopsy). Half the patients (55) had at least one clinical indicator suggesting skeletal metastases, including all patients with proved skeletal metastases. Thus the sensitivity of these clinical indicators was 100% and the specificity 54%. Within one year three of 27 patients with non-confirmed positive bone scans had skeletal metastases, one of which was in the area that had shown increased uptake initially. All these patients had clinical indicators for skeletal metastases and all had inoperable advanced tumours. Four of 69 patients with an initially negative bone scan developed skeletal metastases within one year. It is concluded that in non-small cell lung cancer bone scanning can be restricted to patients with clinical indicators for skeletal metastases. This approach reduces the number of bone scans and consecutive investigations without loss of sensitivity in the detection of skeletal metastases.\r"

  ".W": "Severe idiopathic scoliosis may lead to respiratory failure, which can be treated by assisted ventilation. Twenty four patients with surgically untreated idiopathic scoliosis who had been examined in 1968 were re-examined in 1988 to assess changes in lung function and risk factors for respiratory failure. The patients were aged 15-67 years in 1968 and had a scoliotic angle of 10-190 degrees and a vital capacity of 1.0-6.0 litres. Spirometric values and scoliotic angles were determined in 1968 and 1988, and arterial blood gas tensions in 1988. The decline in spirometric values over the 20 years was of the same magnitude as the predicted decline due to aging. Arterial blood gas tensions in 1988 were strongly correlated with the scoliotic angles and spirometric indices recorded in 1968. Hypoxaemia and hypercapnia was seen in four patients in 1988 (then aged 43-67 years) and these were the four patients who had a vital capacity below 43% predicted in 1968. The remaining 20 patients had blood gas values within normal limits. Two further patients had died from respiratory failure before 1988, so a total of six patients had developed respiratory failure. In a multiple logistic analysis vital capacity expressed as % predicted in 1968 was the strongest predictor of the development of respiratory failure, followed by the scoliotic angle. Respiratory failure occurred only in patients who had a vital capacity below 45% predicted in 1968 and an angle greater than 110 degrees. Thus respiratory failure develops in adults with scoliosis with a large angle and a low vital capacity when normal aging reduces the ventilatory capacity further. Such individuals merit close follow up.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic cough persisting for two months or more that remains unexplained after extensive investigations is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this study was to determine whether such cough is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. Thirteen patients with chronic persistent cough that was unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment were identified. All were non-smokers. The mean (SE) duration of cough was 17.8 (8.0) months. Ten had never had reflux symptoms and three had had mild symptoms only after the onset of the cough. All the patients completed standardised cough diary cards for eight weeks and underwent 24 hour ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring. A reflux episode was defined as a fall in oesophageal pH to below 4.0. Nine control subjects were matched for age, lung function, and body mass index. The patients experienced significantly more episodes of reflux per 24 hours than the controls (115.8 (SE 31.7) versus 4.7 (1.4) and longer reflux episodes (15.5 (5.8) versus 1.7 (0.5) minutes), and the oesophageal pH was below 4.0 considerably longer (84.5 (20.2) versus 3.8 (1.3) minutes). Cough occurred simultaneously with 13% (2.2%) of reflux episodes and within five minutes in another 35% (5.8%) of episodes, whereas gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred simultaneously with 78% (5.5%) of cough episodes and within five minutes in another 12% (2.3%) of episodes. It is concluded that chronic persistent cough that remains unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. It is suggested that a self perpetuating mechanism may exist whereby acid reflux causes cough via a local neuronal oesophageal-tracheo-bronchial reflex, and the cough in turn amplifies reflux via increased transdiaphragmatic pressure or by inducing transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation. Further study of this mechanism and the role of specific antireflux treatment in chronic persistent cough is warranted.\r"

The remaining four patients had a T4 tumour and underwent removal of the right lung and part of the left atrium under total cardiopulmonary bypass. One patient died shortly after the operation from cerebral and cerebellar infarction, and one died 11 months later from brain metastases. Two are alive and well. Complete resection appears to offer a chance for longer survival in patients with advanced lung carcinoma that extends directly into the intrapericardial pulmonary vessels or atrium.\r"

There were no significant differences in the baseline lung function before the two types of challenge in the individual groups and differences between the patients with asthma and with chronic lung disease were minor. When the mean -2 SD of the methacholine response of the control group was taken as the lower limit of normal, 49/52 (94%) patients with asthma and 18/22 (82%) with chronic lung disease responded abnormally. In contrast, with the mean +2 SD of the exercise response of the control group as the upper limit of normal, 41/52 (79%) asthmatic patients responded but none of those with chronic lung disease. Thus the response to the two types of challenge helps to distinguish asthma from other types of chronic lung disease in children.\r"

Bronchial responsiveness (PC20 histamine), lung function, the amplitude of diurnal variation in peak expiratory flow (PEF), and symptom scores were measured. Baseline FEV1 was over 70% predicted and PC20 histamine less than 8 mg/ml. Twelve children were treated with budesonide and terbutaline and 15 with placebo and terbutaline. After four and eight weeks of treatment the change in PC20 was significantly greater after budesonide and terbutaline than after terbutaline alone by 2.1 (95% CI 0.5-3.8) and 1.3 (95% CI 0.1-2.5) doubling doses respectively. Mean FEV1 did not change in either group. The change in afternoon and nocturnal PEF was significantly greater after budesonide and terbutaline than after terbutaline alone. The amplitude of diurnal variation in PEF did not change significantly in either group. Peak flow reversibility decreased in the budesonide group. There were no differences between treatments for cough and dyspnoea, but wheeze improved in the budesonide group. The children with mild asthma treated with budesonide and terbutaline showed improvement in bronchial responsiveness, afternoon and nocturnal PEF, and symptoms of wheeze and a fall in peak flow reversibility by comparison with those who received terbutaline alone.\r"

Eight of the 11 hypoxaemic patients were having long term oxygen therapy. The platelet aggregate ratio was lower in the hypoxaemic patients (0.88 (SE 0.03] than in the non-hypoxaemic (0.97 (0.01] and control groups (1.00 (0.02], and there was a trend to lower aggregate ratios in the more hypoxaemic patients.

Complete excision of the mass, including a margin of normal tissue, may be adequate therapy if a cancer is present and will preserve renal parenchyma if the lesion is benign. Care must be taken not to stretch the limits of this approach. Larger lesions (greater than 3-4 cm) are likely to be cancer and are better treated with a nephrectomy. While this management philosophy is logical and appealing, it has not been validated by clinical experience, and caution must still be exercised.\r"

In patients with prostate cancer, a palpable abnormality usually indicates the presence of carcinoma, but the majority of patients will be upstaged by pathologic examination. In patients undergoing a digitally guided biopsy, it appears critical that those with a negative biopsy be followed closely, as they have a measurable risk of developing overt carcinoma.

However, in the absence of randomized controlled trials, the impact of repeated transurethral resections versus the effect of chemotherapy cannot be assessed adequately, and such trials are urgently needed before neoadjuvant therapy can be considered standard. In addition, newer chemotherapy agents or the combination of currently available drugs with the addition of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor to reduce toxicity and permit dose intensification in an attempt to increase overall response rates offer fruitful avenues for clinical research. Although cisplatin-based chemotherapy obviously does not have the same impact on bladder cancer that it does on testicular cancer, the initial results are encouraging. The \"wall\" has been breached, and the demonstration that urothelial tumors can be added to the list of chemotherapeutically responsive tumors should encourage urologic, radiologic, and medical oncologists to combine efforts in randomized, controlled studies of integrated approaches to therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The sequence of treatment modalities for stage I nonseminomatous germ-cell cancer presented herein represents the evolution of treatment over the past three decades: from retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy or radiation therapy to surveillance to modified retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy or nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. Each new concept has prompted investigators to critically assess patient eligibility criteria and predictors of response and relapse. Primary predictors of treatment success have been local tumor stage (T status), the presence of vascular or lymphatic invasion, and primary tumor histology. These studies have also allowed critical review of the accuracy of radiologic staging, which, although markedly improved over the past decade, remains imperfect. With the advent of effective chemotherapy and improved patient salvage at relapse, these studies have allowed quality of life issues to become incorporated into management decisions. If there can be one conclusion concerning the management of stage I nonseminomatous germ-cell cancer, it must be that there is no one best treatment for all patients. Each treatment is associated with advantages and disadvantages. The treatment therefore should be individualized for each patient. As patients are evaluated, emphasis must be placed on the identification of relapse risk factors through meticulous pathologic review and accurate radiologic staging. Thus, the patients with clinical stage I disease and unfavorable prognostic factors (such as the presence of vascular invasion in the primary tumor, embryonal carcinoma, T2-T4 tumor) should be advised to undergo retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy; if the nodes are negative on frozen section, then modified retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy or nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy should be performed; otherwise, bilateral retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy would provide the best chance of cure. Patients with stage I disease and favorable prognostic factors (such as T1 tumor, teratocarcinoma, absence of vascular invasion in the primary tumor) are suitable for either surveillance or modified or nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy; these options should be thoroughly explained to the patient before any decision is made. Future efforts in this field may take a number of directions. As fertility remains a paramount issue to most patients, long-term studies will be necessary to investigate changes in semen characteristics and eventual paternity in patients followed on surveillance protocols or after either nerve-sparing or modified retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. With continuing improvements in chemotherapy--improved efficacy with reduced toxicity--pathologic, radiographic, or serologic predictors of the site of eventual relapse will become of increasing importance. Indeed, if patients can be identified who are at a significant risk of distant relapse, an initial chemotherapy protocol may be warranted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Patients with sarcomas that are high-grade, greater than 5 cm in diameter, or metastatic at the time of presentation (MSKCC stages 3 and 4) have a combined 3-year relapse-free survival rate of 26%. Complete surgical resection, preferably with negative margins, still offers the best chance of cure. For reasons that are not clear, multimodality therapy in rhabdomyosarcoma is less effective in adult than in pediatric disease. Present-day chemotherapeutic regimens are ineffective in controlling disseminated sarcoma. The adoption of a uniform staging system coupled with multi-institutional collaboration may allow progress to be made in this otherwise deadly form of genitourinary cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Wilms' tumor is the most common malignant tumor of the kidney in children. Although only 500 cases per year are diagnosed in the US, the tumor has been studied extensively in the National Wilms' Tumor Committee Cooperative Studies. These prospective studies have led to improved survival and at the same time reduced treatment and complications in the more favorable cases. Similar results have been shown by the European cooperative study group SIOP using different treatment protocols. These studies have identified a group of tumors with unfavorable histology that are more resistant to treatment and will require more intensive protocols. Diagnosis of Wilms' tumor by the finding of a large flank mass in an otherwise healthy-appearing child is usually easy. Imaging techniques of CT or IVU will give accurate confirmation of Wilms' tumor in 95% of children. Modern treatment in the US by radical nephrectomy followed by chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy depends on tumor stage and histology. Early-stage tumors with favorable histology can be controlled by shorter courses of two-drug treatment (dactinomycin and vincristine) without radiation. Advanced tumors respond to treatment but require more intensive chemotherapy combined with radiation. The final challenge is the child with a tumor of unfavorable histology, particularly if there is advanced-stage disease. Whereas Wilms' tumor showing favorable histology now has a survival rate exceeding 90%, survival of those with tumors of unfavorable histology remains poor. The European (SIOP) studies have shown similar survival figures using preoperative chemotherapy. This technique produces shrinkage of tumors, making them less hemorrhagic and producing a lower incidence of rupture at subsequent surgery. Preoperative chemotherapy does not change the histologic diagnosis of Wilms' tumor and is a useful alternative approach for the large hemorrhagic or infiltrating tumors.\r"

Previously, the spatial association of PIN with invasive carcinoma has been described in the study of total prostatectomies. PIN is frequently recognized in prostate needle biopsy specimens in which no carcinoma is apparent. To further define the potential significance of PIN, we performed repeat ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsy in 21 men who had PIN identified on prostate biopsy performed because of an abnormal finding on digital rectal examination. Twelve patients (57%) had carcinoma identified on their second procedure including all who had intermediate- and high-grade PIN on the initial procedure. Prostate-specific antigen correlated with PIN grade and carcinoma on the secondary procedure, although this did not achieve statistical significance. Men with PIN on prostate needle biopsy should undergo repeat sampling to exclude missed carcinoma.\r"

All procedures were done by one investigator and all pathology reviewed by one senior pathologist. A total of 180 combined procedures were performed on 100 consecutive patients with palpably abnormal prostates; 30 carcinomas were detected. Digitally-directed Biopty biopsy yielded a sensitivity rate of 87 percent compared with 57 percent for needle aspiration (p less than 0.05). Using a numerical comfort scale, the Biopty device was also rated less painful than needle aspiration (p = 0.0001).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate elderly patients who have cystometric detrusor hyperreflexia and to determine the incontinence volume characteristics of these patients during regular daily activities. Ten patients with detrusor hyperreflexia during filling cystometry and an incontinence volume level above 1 L per day were evaluated according to the volume of urine loss per incontinence episode during a ten-day measurement period. All patients studied were found to have an irregular urinary incontinence volume distribution with a wide range of involuntary urine loss per incontinence episode. An irregular pattern of incontinence volume was found in each patient which suggests that detrusor hyperreflexia is manifest as an irregular involuntary loss of urine during daily activities of elderly inpatients. This unstable bladder activity relative to the volume of urine loss appears to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of urinary incontinence in aged inpatients.\r"

Each of these four symptoms were treated as a dichotomous variable, and the prognostic value with respect to vesicoureteral (VUR) reflux was assessed using a linear logistic regression model. Nineteen ureters in 13 patients (16%) demonstrated VUR: grade I, 7 ureters; grade II, 5 ureters; grade III, 3 ureters; grade IV, 4 ureters; and grade V, 0 ureters. Three patients demonstrated renal scarring (16%) and 2 patients underwent surgery. The linear regression analysis revealed that no one symptom, group of symptoms, or absence of all four symptoms segregated those patients likely to have reflux with statistical validity. One of 6 children, therefore, who present with nocturnal enuresis and sterile urine will have reflux. Screening these children with a VCUG should be considered.\r"

Among potential causal factors, we have attempted to determine the importance of the absorption of kinetic energy from the mass of urine driven against the urethral captor (the hydraulic ram effect). Twenty patients (average age 50 +/- 10 years, para 2) suffering from genuine stress urinary incontinence, underwent urodynamic investigation with a constant air-flow pneumatic catheter equipped with two captors separated by an inflatable cuff located just above the urethral captor to block the inrush of urine into the urethra. After cystometric examination had excluded an unstable bladder, two urethral profiles were registered successively, first with cuff deflated, and then with cuff inflated. The values for urethral functional length (FL) and transmission factor (TF) show no significant changes. The values for the maximal urethral closing pressure (MUCP) were significantly lower in the second profile (cuff inflated) in 18 of 20 cases (average decrease 7 cm H2O), which corresponds to 14 percent of the average MUCP measured during the first profile (cuff deflated). The depression quotient increased from an average 0.80 to 1.05 from first to second profile. This study allows quantification of the urethral \"hydraulic ram effect\" which modifies determination of the MUCP during registration of urinary stress profile.\r"

The material consisted of tumors in 83 patients and the mean clinical follow-up time was thirteen years (range 9.6-22 years). The fraction of CA 50-positive cells (FPtot) in microscopic image was scored 0-100 percent. Also the maximally staining region was selected, and the fraction of CA 50-positive cells in this region was scored 0-100 percent (FPmax). The average staining intensity of CA 50-positive cells was scored from 0 to 3 in the whole section (ASItot) and in the maximally staining area (ASImax). The inverse relation between histologic grade, FPtot (p = 0.0001), and ASItot (p = 0.006) was statistically significant. FPtot (p = 0.039) and ASItot (p = 0.018) were also inversely related to clinical stage. Occurrence of metastasis during the follow-up was associated with low CA 50 positivity (FPtot, p = 0.003; ASItot, p = 0.002). The lower the staining intensity or the lower the fraction of CA 50-positive cells, the more aggressive was the tumor. In survival analysis, low FPtot (p = 0.002) and ASItot (p = 0.007) values were related to high risk of bladder cancer death. The results show that immunohistochemical staining of bladder tumor specimens with CA 50 can be used to predict bladder cancer aggressiveness and survival.\r"

It is a member of the glandular kallikrein gene family and has a high sequence homology with human glandular kallikrein (hGK-1). PSA is a serine protease and has chymotrypsin-, trypsin-, and esterase-like activities. It is secreted into the seminal fluid where it degrades two seminal vesicle proteins that are important components of the semen coagulum, thus playing an important role in semen liquefaction. The production of PSA protein appears to be under the control of circulating androgens acting through the androgen receptor. Therefore, the significance of a low serum PSA value in a patient who has undergone previous antiandrogen therapy may not be the same as that for a patient who has not received endocrine treatment.\r"

A follow-up chest film in smokers and those older than 40 years is strongly recommended. In inpatients, the evaluation and treatment are tailored to individual cases. A search for a wider range of causes, using invasive tests if necessary, is undertaken, and all likely pathogens should be covered with the initial antibiotic therapy.\r"

One patient died before being treated and another patient was seen but not treated. Plasma exchange was performed daily for a mean of seven exchanges per patient. The replacement fluid during plasma exchange was fresh frozen plasma in all cases. The complete response rates for each type of treatment were as follows: 88% for plasma exchange (15 patients), 47% for exchange transfusions (7 patients), and 67% for exchange transfusions and plasma exchange (4 patients). Clinical and laboratory factors were examined for any statistically significant association with therapy response. Treatment with plasma exchange was statistically the initial factor most strongly associated with prognosis. Paresis, paresthesias, seizures, mental status change, and coma showed no association with response to treatment. Some of the laboratory factors that did not show significant association with treatment response were the initial creatinine, hemoglobin, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase, and total bilirubin. This study supports the hypothesis that plasma exchange has significantly improved the prognosis of patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. These patients should be treated aggressively regardless of the severity of their symptoms.\r"

We compared access among Latino citizens of the United States (including permanent legal residents), undocumented Latinos, and Anglos, and analyzed predictors of access. Among the sample of 958 respondents were 137 Latino citizens, 54 undocumented Latinos, and 680 Anglos. Compared with Anglos, Latino citizens and undocumented immigrants had less access to medical care by all measures used in the survey. Although undocumented Latinos were less likely than Latino citizens to have health insurance, by most other measures their access did not differ significantly. By multivariate analysis, health insurance status and not ethnicity was the most important predictor of access. Because access to medical care is limited for both Latino citizens and undocumented immigrants, policy proposals to improve access for Latinos should consider current barriers faced by these groups and local differences in access to medical care.\r"

  ".W": "Congestive heart failure is a common syndrome with high mortality in its advanced stages. Current therapy includes the use of vasodilator drugs, which have been shown to prolong life. Despite current therapy, mortality remains high in patients with severe heart failure. Potent new inotropic vasodilators have improved ventricular performance but have not prolonged life in patients with end-stage heart failure. Serious arrhythmias are implicated in the sudden deaths of 30% to 40% of patients with severe heart failure, but the benefits of antiarrhythmic therapy have not been established. Upcoming trials will address this question. Ventricular remodeling and progressive dilatation after myocardial infarction commonly lead to congestive heart failure; early unloading of the ventricle with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor may attenuate these events. These findings support the concept that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be useful in managing heart failure of all degrees of severity, including left ventricular dysfunction and end-stage heart failure. Part of the damage that may occur with acute myocardial infarction, particularly in this era of thrombolysis therapy, is reperfusion injury, which may be mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals. Better knowledge of the mechanisms and treatment of myocardial infarction, the leading cause of congestive heart failure, may help prevent or attenuate the development of this syndrome.\r"

Symptoms that occur after meals usually are mild and rarely signify serious disease. With rare exceptions, hypoglycemia resulting in major symptoms occurs in the food-deprived state. Lower concentrations of plasma insulin and C-peptide and a concomitant low plasma glucose are major clues to a correct diagnosis.\r"

To determine rural physicians' knowledge and attitudes about AIDS, a questionnaire was mailed to 321 physicians practicing in rural Utah. Of the 169 physicians who completed questionnaires, 96% thought that their community or area of service had only a minor or no problem with AIDS; 89%, however, thought that their chance of seeing a patient who was HIV-positive was fair to moderate. Of the 169 respondents, 3% were not sure whether they would even treat a patient who had AIDS, 67% said they would, and 30% said they would not. Although all physicians are at risk of seeing a patient who has had exposure to HIV and other blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis B, only 55% of the respondents felt a need to take clinical precautions to prevent their exposure to the virus. Our study shows the need for all rural Utah physicians to reevaluate their risk of exposure to HIV, to increase precautionary measures for their own protection, to consider the ethical responsibility of treating AIDS patients, and to take a more active role in teaching their patients how to protect themselves from exposure to the virus.\r"

  ".W": "The states of Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WAMI) have all had declines in the proportion of physicians offering obstetric services during the past few years, a decline precipitated by rising medical malpractice premiums. One response to the problem of rising liability premiums has been the passage of extensive tort reform legislation. We present the results of recent studies of physicians' obstetric practices in the WAMI states and summarize the major changes in tort legislation and regulation that have occurred in these states. Most general and family physicians in the WAMI region no longer provide obstetric care; by contrast, more than 80% of the obstetrician-gynecologists in the WAMI states are still practicing obstetrics. Despite the fact that only a minority of family physicians are still active in obstetrics, most rural family physicians in all four states still deliver babies. Most physicians in all four states limit the amount of care they provide to those covered by Medicaid, which suggests that significant barriers to care exist for medically indigent persons. All four states have adopted significant tort reforms. Despite these changes in the legal environment, the cost of malpractice premiums and concerns over the likelihood of being sued continue to limit the number of physicians willing to provide obstetric care. Although it cannot be inferred from these data that tort reform has decreased the rate at which physicians give up obstetric practice, the evidence is compatible with such a conclusion.\r"

Specific inherited (adenomatous polyposis coli gene) and acquired (ras gene point mutations; c-myc gene amplification; allelic deletion at specific sites on chromosomes 5, 17, and 18) genetic abnormalities appear to be capable of mediating steps in the progression from normal to malignant colonic mucosa. Understanding these genetic factors and how they influence cellular function will have a profound effect on medical practice. High-risk populations will be (and are being) identified by genetic markers, thus allowing prevention and screening to be more precisely targeted to the population at risk; intervention strategies will be designed on the basis of the known cellular defects of neoplastic colonic mucosa; and new molecular preventive and therapeutic approaches can be developed.\r"
