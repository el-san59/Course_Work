Participants had similar socioeconomic profiles, equal access to health benefits, and received standard treatment. Median duration of observation was 42 months. Blacks had 48, and whites 129, of the 177 morbid (strokes and heart attacks) or mortal cardiovascular disease outcomes. At baseline, blacks had more electrocardiographic abnormalities (32% vs. 19%, p less than 0.0001), lower mean cholesterol (218 vs. 230 mg%, p less than 0.001), smoked more (35% vs. 30%, p less than 0.001), and were less likely to be treated for hypertension before entering the program (53% vs. 58%, p less than 0.01) than whites. They were also more likely than whites to belong to unions employing less skilled workers (p less than 0.0001). Overall, all-cause mortality rates between the races were similar. However, total cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality rates were 10.5 (whites) and 6.4 (blacks) per 1,000 person years (p less than 0.005); the difference was largely explained by higher myocardial infarction rates among older (55 years or older) white men (15.6 vs. 7.5, p less than 0.05). That advantage was not present amongst younger black persons. In fact, blacks lost more years of life before age 65 (102 vs. 64 years/1,000 persons, p less than 0.025).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Average systolic blood pressure was 103 versus 120 mm Hg in the remaining INTERSALT centers; diastolic blood pressure in these four population samples averaged 63 versus 74 mm Hg in the 48 other centers. There was little or no upward slope of blood pressure with age; hypertension was present in only 5% of the rural Kenyan sample and virtually absent in the other three centers. Also in marked contrast with the rest of the centers was level of daily salt intake, as estimated by 24-hour urinary sodium excretion. Median salt intake ranged from under 1 g to 3 g daily versus more than 9 g in the rest of INTERSALT populations. Average body weight was also low in these four centers, with no or low average alcohol intake, again unlike the other centers. The association within these four centers between the above variables and blood pressure was low, possibly reflecting their limited variability. While several other INTERSALT centers also had low average body weight or low prevalence of alcohol drinking, when this was accompanied by much higher salt intake (7-12 g salt or 120-210 mmol sodium daily), hypertension prevalence ranged from 8% to 19%. These findings confirm previous reports that in populations with a low salt intake, there is little or no hypertension or rise of blood pressure with age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood pressure fell 58 +/- 13 mm Hg in 1K1C rats after removal of the clip. When body fluid volume was kept at the same level as before \"unclipping,\" blood pressure fell only 9 +/- 2 mm Hg after removal of the clip; if body fluid volume was then allowed to decrease, blood pressure fell an additional 55 +/- 8 mm Hg. When Ang II was infused after removal of the clip, blood pressure fell 26 +/- 7 mm Hg despite the fact that plasma Ang II increased to nonphysiological concentrations (1,161 +/- 353 pg/ml). After Ang II infusion was stopped, blood pressure fell an additional 44 +/- 13 mm Hg. When Ang II was infused and body fluid volume kept constant, blood pressure still did not change after removal of the clip, although plasma Ang II concentrations increased to nonphysiological levels (618 +/- 98 pg/ml). After the Ang II infusion was discontinued and the body fluid volume was no longer kept constant, blood pressure fell 78 +/- 9 mm Hg. These data further support the hypothesis that a volume factor, not the renin-angiotensin system, is important in the maintenance of high blood pressure in 1K1C hypertension.\r"

In chloralose-anesthetized rats, ethanol had no effect on baseline mean arterial pressure, heart rate, or sympathetic efferent discharge when microinjected into the nucleus tractus solitarius, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the rostral ventrolateral medulla, or the posterior hypothalamus. On the other hand, ethanol microinjection into the anterior hypothalamus caused a site-dependent pressor effect and an increase in sympathetic efferent discharge. Baroreceptor heart rate response but not sympathetic efferent discharge response was impaired by ethanol microinjection into the nucleus tractus solitarius, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and the rostral ventrolateral medulla, suggesting that ethanol involves one or more of these areas in its inhibitory effect on baroreceptor heart rate response and that ethanol has a selective action on baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate. The findings that 1) the effect was dose dependent and 2) injection of ethanol outside of, or an equal volume of cerebrospinal fluid into, the nucleus tractus solitarius had no effect on the response strongly suggest that the observed effect on baroreceptor heart rate response was ethanol mediated. Ethanol microinjection into the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus impaired the heart rate response, thus raising the possibility that leakage of ethanol to that area from the nucleus tractus solitarius might have contributed to its effect. These findings show that ethanol has a pressor and sympathoexcitatory site of action within the anterior hypothalamus and that it selectively impairs baroreceptor heart rate response via a central site of action; the mechanisms by which ethanol produces these effects remain to be elucidated.\r"

Ang II-induced degradation of polyphosphoinositides and accumulation of inositol di- and tris-phosphates was enhanced (approximately twofold) in hypertensive-derived cells, without a change (vs. normotensive-derived cells) in half-maximally effective concentrations of Ang II. Intracellular pH (approximately 6.6) was comparable between both cell isolates at quiescence, but alkalinization induced by Ang II, serum, or phorbol ester was greater (delta 0.1-0.2 pH units) for hypertensive-derived cells. For both cell types, the intracellular pH response to these agonists was prevented in the presence of Na+-H+ exchange inhibitors. S6 kinase activation induced by Ang II was enhanced (approximately twofold) in hypertensive-derived cells, whereas activation in response to serum or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate did not differ significantly between the two cell types. Quantitation of protein kinase C by immunoblotting and [3H]phorbol dibutyrate binding procedures revealed no differences between the two smooth muscle cell isolates (at quiescence or in the presence of serum) with respect to either total amounts or subcellular distribution. Sensitivity of protein kinase C to phorbol ester was apparently also not different between the two cell types, as assessed from dose-dependent (phorbol ester) S6 kinase activation profiles. Phorbol ester caused a similar subcellular redistribution of [3H]phorbol dibutyrate binding in the two cell isolates, but for both, minimal (10%) translocation occurred in response to Ang II. The data suggest that enhanced agonist responsiveness in vascular smooth muscle cells is unlikely to involve alterations in protein kinase C.\r"

  ".W": "To study the mechanisms and roles of vascular structural changes during the development of hypertension, we coarcted or sham-coarcted the abdominal aorta of rats. At intervals of 3 to 56 days later, we obtained standardized segments of thoracic and abdominal aortas for measurement of dry weight, water content, and amino acid content. Carotid arterial pressure was elevated by day 5 in coarcted rats and remained elevated. Femoral and tail arterial pressures remained normal. Cardiac ventricular weight and dry weight of the thoracic aorta, normalized for body weight, rose rapidly over 3-10 days in coarcted rats, remaining constant at 50-60% above levels in sham-coarcted rats thereafter. In contrast, water content of thoracic aorta in coarcted rats peaked at 123% of control values on day 7 (p less than 0.001), falling rapidly thereafter to levels about half of peak. Increments in dry weight and water content of the normotensive abdominal aortic segments were of far lesser magnitude and occurred 1 to 2 weeks later, probably reflecting the effects of initial hypotension of the hindquarters. Percent hydroxyproline of intima-media segments of the thoracic aorta remained normal during the 8-week period, indicating that increases in aortic dry weight did not represent disproportional fibrosis and thus are attributable to muscular hypertrophy. These results provide support for the hypothesis that arterial wall \"waterlogging\" is primarily an early manifestation of the hypertensive process. The greatest magnitude of waterlogging coincides with the rapid early increase in aortic dry weight, representing hypertrophy, which suggests common mechanisms, such as activation of Na+-H+ antiport.\r"

  ".W": "In-depth analysis of an anesthetic mishap requires the acquisition and analysis of a complex body of data. These tasks are facilitated by specific tools and approaches. At the outset, the reviewer should create a registry for documents and seek a factual overview of events. Basic information about case management should be obtained with a structured survey instrument. Critical pieces of information must be explicitly indexed for later examination. Timelines are particularly effective for organizing and displaying key events. The process of data analysis can be expedited by starting with broad concerns and moving to finer distinctions in a stepwise manner. Preparation of a short summary is the first analytic task. Next, the relationships between the injury, the mechanism of injury, and the contributory actions of the caretakers are formally linked as a hypothesis of injury. Finally, each contributory action is examined individually to determine if it represents a deviation from the standard of care. Contradictory information is an expected feature of in-depth analysis. This problem can often be resolved by testing for clinical relevance, identifying obvious inaccuracies, and emphasizing findings from the most reliable sources. Recent work suggests that practicing anesthesiologists can analyze mishaps with a significant degree of interrater reliability. Thus, aggregate data obtained from in-depth analysis may play an increasingly important role in research, risk management, and peer review.\r"

The relationship between R and K.t/V is also affected by the amount of ultrafiltrate removed during the dialysis session, because convective urea removal, which is a part of K, does not result in a lowering of the (Ct). In stable adult maintenance dialysis patients receiving 3 treatments/week, with an NPCR of less than or equal to 1.1 g/kg/day and zero residual renal function, the target K.t/V is 1.05 and the target R will be about 0.41. In patients who require different K.t/V values, corresponding values of R can be computed. Based on an empiric examination of the urea kinetic equations, several formulas are proposed for estimating K.t/V from R and vice versa, which depend only on the dialysis session length t, the amount of ultrafiltrate UF, and the postdialysis weight W or V; e.g., K.t/V = - ln (R - 0.008.t-UF/W). After K.t/V has been estimated from R, t, UF and W, one can then estimate the NPCR in the residual renal urea clearance (Kru) has also been measured. From the estimated K.t/V, the Kru, and an estimated V, the total urea clearance over time corrected for V (\"KT\") is computed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For CFPD, after instillation of 30 ml/kg into the peritoneal cavity, dialysate was continually infused and drained at approximately 25 ml/kg/h. A dwell volume of 30 ml/kg was also used for IPD. Similar length cycles of each technique were compared in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2 total solute clearance and ultrafiltration achieved over two consecutive IPD cycles were compared with CFPD of a similar duration. The catheter functioned well with few complications. In Experiment 1, CFPD produced greater ultrafiltration and significantly improved the clearance of urea, potassium and phosphate compared to IPD. No significant difference between the techniques was observed in Experiment 2. Our data suggest that for CFPD to retain its advantage over IPD intermittent complete drainage of the peritoneal cavity may be necessary.\r"

We evaluated lipoprotein and apoprotein profiles in 30 male and 28 female uremic patients on dialysis in order to compare the results with 30 male and 19 female non-uremic controls and to detect any differences in lipemic pattern due to different types of dialysis. The dyslipidemic picture typical of uremia was observed in both sexes, coupled with significant hypertriglyceridemia and an increase in the lipid components of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). There was also a significant reduction in high density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol and HDL2 cholesterol. Apo C levels were increased, whereas Apo AI and AII were diminished. Apo B levels were unchanged. We also evaluated their lipid profile in relation to three types of dialysis: hemodialysis, hemofiltration and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Analysis of variance of three different types of dialysis performed for comparable periods of time showed that the parameters typically altered in uremia (Tg, VLDL, ApoC, ApoE) were uniform, whereas differences were observed in the variables indicative of cholesterol and phospholipid metabolism. The alterations of cholesterol metabolism in some subjects, in addition to the specific alterations of Tg metabolism, help explain the elevated prevalence of atherosclerotic complications in dialysed uremic patient.\r"

Six patients received a total of twenty treatments by MHF and four CAVHF, mean duration of treatment 56 hours, range 24-160. Intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured using a subdural catheter. During treatment with MHF, the mean ICP increased from 8.9 +/- 1.4 mmHg at the start of filtration to 14.8 +/- 2.1 mmHg at the end of treatment (p less than 0.05), whereas there was no corresponding increase during the same period of time with CAVHF treatment, the mean ICP fell, but not significantly from 19.4 +/- 4.8 mmHg to 11.2 +/- 2.3 mmHg. The mean ICP increased to greater than 25 mmHg on eleven occasions during treatment with MHF, requiring treatment with bolus mannitol or propofol, during the same period of treatment with CAVHF no such surges in ICP were recorded. This suggests that continuous haemofiltration is to be preferred to intermittent machine haemofiltration in the management of patients with acute hepatorenal failure.\r"

As elevated serum prolactin levels are believed to contribute to altered sexual function in uremia, we followed serum prolactin and testosterone levels during four months of r-HuEPO therapy. Within these four months, hematocrit values rose from 23.7 +/- 1.2 to 35.7 +/- 0.2% and hemoglobin from 7.3 +/- 0.3 to 11.3 +/- 0.4 g/100 ml. In parallel, serum prolactin values decreased significantly, from 66.9 +/- 9.3 to 9.6 +/- 2.6 ng/ml in females and from 39.5 +/- 10.5 to 10.3 +/- 1.0 ng/ml in male dialysis patients. Testosterone concentrations were in the lower normal range in male patients and remained unchanged during r-HuEPO therapy. Sexual function improved in four out of seven males, and five out of nine female patients started to have regular menstruations again. It appears that treatment of anemia in end-stage renal disease by r-HuEPO may improve sexual function by lowering elevated serum prolactin concentrations.\r"

This investigation has compared the influence of these plasticisers with that of DEHP on platelet adhesion and platelet aggregate formation. PVC tubing was tested in the absence of anticoagulants and in the presence of heparin. Our results demonstrate the influence of plasticisers on platelet response and support the view that evaluation of such plasticisers should be extended from an examination of toxicological properties to a comprehensive blood compatibility assessment.\r"

All four knees with both medial and lateral meniscectomy had unsatisfactory results despite obtaining anatomical alignment. Eight patients needed subsequent surgery; five of them had total knee replacement, four within four years of the osteotomy. Proximal tibial osteotomy in younger patients with secondary arthritis gives similar results to those for older patients with primary osteoarthritis. If it fails, this is generally within the first four years after the operation.\r"

Some also had lateral tibial subluxation with twisting of the distal femur and proximal tibia in opposite directions. We assessed the articular geometry by precise radiographic analysis, and compared the results with those in normal volunteers and a group of osteoarthritic patients. The prevalence of this type of deformity in our osteoarthritic patients was 11.5%; its recognition allows the use of specific operative correction that may include double osteotomy or the precise orientation of prosthetic components.\r"

By three months the implant was covered with immature new tissue, and a dense vascular network crossed its surface. At 12 months a new ligament had developed and matured, looking like the natural one in most cases. Histology at this stage showed abundant collagenous fibres running parallel and longitudinally, while the synovial membrane showed no more than very slight inflammatory changes. By 18 to 24 months, the new ligament often had the arthroscopic appearance of a normal anterior cruciate ligament. These results suggest that this scaffold type of artificial ligament is effective for cruciate reconstruction, giving satisfactory healing without significant complications.\r"

The first granuloma was in the region of the lesser trochanter in 10, and near the tip of the stem in only two. Speed of growth varied but on average there was doubling of the area on anteroposterior films in 2.2 years (range 6 months to 4.6 years). Aggressive granulomatous lesions in replaced hips are a distinct condition, different from simple loosening or infection; the lesions may grow rapidly, so revision surgery is indicated soon after diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "We have reviewed our recent results with functional bracing of tibial shaft fractures in adults in order to define its role in management. We also analysed several parameters of these fractures to discover those which influence healing. A total of 780 tibial fractures treated in prefabricated functional braces were followed to union; shortening of less than 10 mm and angulation of less than 5 degrees in any plane were our parameters for successful treatment. The average time before applying a brace was 3.8 weeks for closed fractures and 5.2 weeks for open ones. Closed fractures healed in an average of 17.4 weeks and open fractures in an average of 21.7 weeks, 90% of them with 10 mm of shortening or less. Varus angulation and posterior angulation were the most common deformities encountered at union. There were 20 nonunions (2.5%) and 46 braces were discontinued during treatment. We found no association between fracture healing and the patient's age, the mechanism of injury or the fracture location. The degree of soft tissue injury appeared to have most influence on the speed of fracture healing. Fracture comminution and initial displacement, the condition of the fibula and the time from injury to bracing also appeared to affect the speed of union.\r"

Our aim was to determine the relationship between proximal femoral growth abnormalities and metaphyseal cysts, epiphyseal extrusion, physeal narrowing, and extensive epiphyseal necrosis. The average follow-up after treatment was 9.8 years (range 4 to 16 years), and 37 of the hips were followed to skeletal maturity. Slowing of proximal femoral growth was common: symmetrical abnormality was seen in 26 hips and asymmetrical abnormality in nine. However, definite premature closure of the proximal femoral physis was seen in only three hips. Abnormality seemed to be due to altered growth velocity rather than to bar formation in most cases. Metaphyseal cysts, epiphyseal extrusion and physeal narrowing during the active stage of the disease, alone or in combination, were found to be neither sensitive nor specific predictors of the subsequent growth pattern.\r"

When the fracture had occurred between the ages of 7 and 13 years, the limb overgrew about 1 cm regardless of sex, upper limb dominance, age, fracture site or configuration. Excessive fracture overlap at the time of injury, but not at union, increased limb overgrowth. Angulation of the fracture remodelled in children injured under 10 years of age, but in older patients this sometimes added to limb shortening. Rotational deformities were minor and gave no symptoms. Treatment of the 7- to 13-year-old patient should aim at 1 cm overlap at union, with correction of angular deformity being more important in children over 10 years of age. This management of fractures will give a maximum leg length discrepancy of 1 cm at skeletal maturity.\r"

An unsatisfactory outcome was associated with 3.4 signs per film and with subsidence of more than 5 mm. The radiological signs we describe are often the hallmark of successful load transmission, but if they increase with time or are associated with subsidence of over 5 mm, then clinical failure is likely. Fracture of the cement tip is associated with increased subsidence and adversely affects the long-term clinical outcome.\r"

In 11 patients the infections were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. CRP exceeded 20 mg/l in 18 patients and the ESR was more than 30 mm/hr in 14. In only one infected patient were both CRP and ESR below these levels. All of 33 patients with non-septic loosening had CRP less than 20 mg/l and ESR less than 30 mm/hr before revision.

In the two other patients, spontaneous ossification of a radiologically presumed ABC in the lytic and expansile phase was observed after nine and seven months respectively. The healed lesions have remained stable at 12, 32, and 36 months respectively. These findings suggest that when the diagnosis can be made with confidence, and the lesion is in a location and at a stage that does not entail any risk of fracture or compression, expectant management should be considered. Our three patients were aged 22, 19 and 18 years, older than usual for developing ABC. This is also true for many of the few other reported cases of spontaneous or almost spontaneous healing and suggests that ABC has a greater tendency to stabilise in older patients.\r"

The effects of a single dose (160 mg) and one week's treatment (80 mg twice a day) on platelet function were compared in healthy young subjects. There were no significant changes in circulating platelet aggregates, template bleeding time, platelet factor 3 availability and thromboxane beta 2 (TX beta 2) generation. Platelet aggregation responses as assessed by angle of slope and maximal percentage aggregation (all agonists) and lag phase (collagen) showed no changes of biological importance, although minor changes reaching significance were observed with some agonists. These findings suggest that propranolol does not significantly affect platelet function when taken at doses commonly encountered in clinical practice.\r"

Pulmonary embolism was significantly more common among cancer patients than in those with non-neoplastic diseases. Among those palliatively treated, patients with ovarian cancer, cancer of the extrahepatic bile duct system, and cancer of the stomach had the highest prevalence of pulmonary embolism (34.6%, 31.7%, and 15.2%, respectively). Necropsy patients with cancer of the oesophagus and larynx, together with leukaemia, myelomatosis, and malignant lymphoma had the lowest prevalence (0-5.6%). Palliatively treated cancers in organs of the peritoneal cavity had a significantly higher incidence than all other cancers combined. Cancer of the peritoneal cavity may impede venous drainage from the lower limbs and thus be an important factor in the onset of deep calf vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. It is concluded that cancer represents an increased risk factor for onset of pulmonary embolism, in particular in patients with ovarian cancer and cancer of the extrahepatic bile duct system.\r"

Undecalcified histological sections were prepared and two structural histomorphometric parameters were estimated. Estimates of the percentage of trabecular bone volume (%TBV) deviated systematically, with variation of the biopsy site around the usual location, increasing in magnitude from the anterior to the posterior ilium. Such differences highlight the importance of understanding the degree of variation which exists in histomorphometric data. The histomorphometry of a vertical biopsy specimen of the iliac crest did not differ significantly from that of a transilial biopsy specimen of similar diameter taken from an adjacent site. When taken at the standard site, and when providing a long core of cancellous bone, with minimal discomfort to the patient, the vertical biopsy specimen compares well with the transiliac biopsy specimen for use for investigating metabolic bone disorders.\r"

The first was similar to a columnar cell comprising a single cell population which covered extensive areas of the adenomas. This cell type often showed supranuclear lysozyme reactivity and apical neutral mucins, sialomucins, and sulphomucins in variable amounts. The second cell type was found in 11 adenomas, located mainly in the fundal area. It seemed to be a transitional form between the goblet cell and the Paneth cell. This cell type was scattered among columnar cells, occasional Paneth-like cells, and small goblet cells. These two types of intermediate cells may be regarded as abnormally differentiated integral elements of gastric adenomas. They may be associated with the neck stem cells in the cytogenesis of gastric adenomas.\r"

All 32 patients with active chronic gastritis at 234 out of 320 sites were positive for C pylori: 227 showed colonisation with C pylori by the Warthin-Starry stain; and 222 were positive by culture. C pylori was not found in 18 patients with inactive chronic gastritis or histologically normal mucosa. The area of C pylori colonisation was larger than the area of active chronic gastritis in 289 positive specimens on culture and 261 on staining, respectively, suggesting that C pylori colonisation may precede the development of active chronic gastritis. It is concluded that patchy distribution of active chronic gastritis and C pylori colonisation must be considered, particularly in serology or breath test studies where the histological examination serves as a reference. Furthermore, it may have important implications for the follow up of patients after antibacterial treatment. The topographic and specific association of C pylori and active chronic gastritis provides further evidence for the pathogenic role of C pylori in active chronic gastritis.\r"

The results were compared with those of Southern blotting on extracted DNA from eight hepatocellular carcinomata. The data agreed with those of Southern blotting in six cases (two positive, four negative) but in two other positive cases PCR failed to amplify HBV sequences. This suggests deletion or mutation, or both, of this viral region in these cases. PCR was also used to amplify HBV sequences from formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded tissue. Tissue inhibition of PCR occurred which increased with the number of tissue sections. It was present in tissues from different organs and species and fixed by different procedures, thus highlighting the need for a positive control during amplification. Use of formalin fixed Alexander cells, however, showed a sensitivity of one viral copy per 5000 cells. Confirmation of the identity of the PCR products was carried out using PCR-generated biotinylated probes, and suggested the insertion of extra nucleotide sequences or infection with an HBV variant in one case.\r"

One pattern (pattern 1) was seen in several patients and environmental samples. Another pattern (pattern 2) was identified repeatedly in samples from skin and mucous membranes of patients in the same ward. After thorough cleaning was undertaken throughout the unit, the pattern 1 strain was no longer cultivated from clinical samples. It is concluded that cell envelope protein electrophoresis is a useful method for tracing epidemic strains of A calcoaceticus.\r"

By both assessments, all-trans-retinoic acid prevented atrophy. Noninterference with the anti-inflammatory property of steroids was tested in a phorbol ester-induced mouse ear edema model and by histologic assessment of croton oil-induced inflammation of mouse dermis. We found that all-trans-retinoic acid did not interfere with steroid suppression of either edema or dermal inflammation. Thus all-trans-retinoic acid was effective in preventing steroid-induced atrophy without affecting the steroid's anti-inflammatory property.\r"

Treatment was continued until at least one ulcer of each pair was healed. The rate of healing of the hydrocolloid membrane-treated ulcers was significantly faster than that of the control ulcers. Pain was rapidly and dramatically reduced in all hydrocolloid membrane-treated ulcers. An infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurred in a hydrocolloid membrane-treated ulcer but rapidly responded to topical therapy. Hydrocolloid membrane treatment of sclerodermatous hand ulcers appears to be an effective method of accelerating healing and reducing pain.\r"

They were sensitive to UVB, UVA, and visible light. In 10 of 13 patients tested, the dermal infiltrate contained predominantly suppressor T cells. Many also had a reversed helper-suppressor T cell ratio. Circulating lymphocytes with deeply indented nuclei were present in all but were most pronounced in the most photosensitive erythrodermic patients. Tolerance induction therapy with UVB irradiation produced an excellent or good response in 13 of 15 patients. One patient responded to cyclosporine therapy.\r"

Although examination of the female infant yielded no specific findings suggestive of the syndrome, her mother and maternal great-grandmother had features that allowed the diagnosis to be made. Only after 5 months did the streaky hyperkeratotic pattern characteristic of the syndrome develop in the child. Family members bore other stigmata, including patchy cicatricial alopecia, coarse hair, follicular atrophoderma, frontal bossing, cataracts, short stature, and short proximal limbs. The pattern of inheritance in this family is compatible with that of an X-linked dominant genodermatosis with variable expression. Histopathologic findings from skin biopsy specimens were psoriasiform rather than ichthyotic. Decreased peroxisomal enzyme activity was discovered on fibroblast cultures, linking this syndrome with other peroxisomal disorders. Treatment with oral bezafibrate and clofibrate, which are potential inducers of hepatic peroxisomes, did not result in clinical improvement. It is recommended that usage of the term chondrodysplasia punctata be restricted to the descriptive radiologic finding of stippled calcifications and that Conradi-Hunermann syndrome refer only to the disease described herein, which is transmitted as an X-linked dominant trait.\r"

In a double-blind study 32 elderly patients with chronic postherpetic neuralgia were treated with either capsaicin cream or its vehicle for a 6-week period. Response to treatment was evaluated by visual analogue scales of pain and of pain relief, together with changes in a categoric pain scale and in a physician's global evaluation. Significantly greater relief in the capsaicin-treated group compared with vehicle was observed for all efficacy variables. After 6 weeks almost 80% of capsaicin-treated patients experienced some relief from their pain. Because capsaicin avoids problems with drug interactions and systemic toxicity, we suggest that topical capsaicin be considered for initial management of postherpetic neuralgia.\r"

The clinical diagnostic groups were contact dermatitis (6 cases), drug eruption (14), lupus erythematosus (6), lichen planus (3), cutaneous T cell lymphoma (3), chronic dermatitis or neurodermatitis (19), and miscellaneous dermatologic disorders (11). With the use of individual histologic features, a correlation with specific clinical conditions was possible, and the clinical groups of dermatitis, drug eruption, lupus erythematosus or lichen planus, and T cell infiltration could be selected histologically. Direct immunofluorescence studies were of most help in the diagnosis of lupus erythematosus and atypical lichen planus, but these studies should be performed in all cases involving lichenoid inflammation. Although previously the nonspecific term lichenoid dermatitis was used to classify the histologic features in these cases, we found that by careful correlation of histologic, immunodermatologic, and clinical features, we were often able to provide a specific diagnosis.\r"

Because most of the victims' remains were severely decomposed with partial or complete skeletonization and little or no personal effects were recovered, forensic odontologic methods played a key role in their identifications. Although numerous methods were used to accumulate leads to the identities of the badly decomposed skeletonized remains, leads generated through traditional investigative methods established the identities in most cases. Of 40 victims, 36 have now been identified, mainly by means of dental evidence. This article details the challenges presented by serial homicides and the key role of forensic odontologic methods in the Green River Murders investigation.\r"

To study whether it is also predictive for hypercholesterolemic men, data from 3,806 asymptomatic hypercholesterolemic men in the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial were analyzed. All the men had performed a submaximal treadmill exercise test at baseline, before they were assigned to the cholestyramine or placebo treatment group. Because of missing or inconclusive data, 31 men were excluded from the analyses. A test was positive if the ST segment was displaced by greater than or equal to 1 mm (visual code) or there was greater than or equal to 10 microV-s change in the ST integral (computer code), or both. The prevalence of a positive test was 8.3%. During the 7 to 10 year (mean 7.4) follow-up period, the mortality rate from coronary heart disease was 6.7% (21 of 315) in men with a positive test and 1.3% (46 of 3,460) in men with a negative test (placebo and cholestyramine groups combined). The age-adjusted rate ratio for a positive test, compared with a negative test, was 6.7 in the placebo group and 4.8 in the cholestyramine group. With use of Cox's proportional hazards models, it was found that the risk of death from coronary heart disease associated with a positive test was 5.7 times higher in the placebo group and 4.9 times higher in the cholestyramine group after adjustment for age, smoking history, systolic blood pressure, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. A positive test was not significantly associated with nonfatal myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At baseline study, all patients had a left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%; 81% were in New York Heart Association functional class II. The etiology of heart failure was ischemic in 62% and nonischemic in 38%. During an average follow-up period of 16 months, 47 patients (16%) died and 24 deaths were classified as sudden. By univariate analysis, left ventricular ejection fraction, ventricular premature beat frequency, couplet frequency, ventricular tachycardia frequency, functional class, treadmill exercise time and nonischemic heart disease were statistically associated with mortality. With multiple logistic regression analysis, left ventricular ejection fraction was identified as the variable most closely associated with total mortality (p = 0.006). Twenty-seven percent of patients with an ejection fraction less than or equal to 20% died compared with 7% with an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 30%. Ventricular tachycardia frequency on Holter monitoring was independently associated with both total mortality (p = 0.008) and sudden death (p = 0.003). Patients with a ventricular tachycardia frequency of greater than 0.088 events/h had a mortality rate of 34% compared with 12% in those without ventricular tachycardia.

In this study, plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A during anginal attacks in 24 patients with variant angina were examined. A hyperventilation test was used to induce angina. Hyperventilation induced angina and ST segment elevation (AST: 0.32 +/- 0.14 mV, p less than 0.01) in eight patients with variant angina. Fibrinopeptide A increased from 0.75 +/- 0.27 at control to 7.8 +/- 4.4 ng/ml (p less than 0.01) during anginal attacks in these eight patients. In addition, four patients had spontaneous attacks of angina; they also had elevated levels of fibrinopeptide A during attacks (from 2.0 +/- 1.2 at control to 21.9 +/- 18.0 ng/ml [p less than 0.01] during attacks). Hyperventilation did not induce either angina or ST segment elevation in 12 of the patients with variant angina. Fibrinopeptide A levels did not change with hyperventilation in these patients. To determine whether elevated plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A were associated with angina, the plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A were examined during exercise-induced angina in seven additional patients with stable effort angina. They all developed angina with treadmill exercise; however, plasma fibrinopeptide A did not change. Therefore, only the patients with variant angina demonstrated elevated levels of fibrinopeptide A during anginal attacks. These findings suggest that coronary vasospasm associated with myocardial ischemia may induce stasis of blood, resulting in fibrinogen-fibrin conversion in the coronary vessels.\r"

Serial samples were obtained to characterize the changes in urinary fibrinopeptide A levels over time in patients with ischemic heart disease.

  ".W": "To investigate the relation between basal coronary artery diameter and development of coronary artery spasm, the diameters of the proximal, middle and distal segments of the three major coronary artery branches, together with that of the left main trunk, were measured on a control angiogram and after ergonovine and nitrate administration in 30 patients with vasospastic angina without significant organic stenosis, and in 35 patients without ischemic heart disease. The percent change in coronary diameter after ergonovine and nitrate administration compared with the control diameter was used as an index of coronary vasoreactivity. In patients with vasospastic angina, coronary artery responses to both ergonovine and nitrate were greater in the spastic segments than in the other segments (p less than 0.05), and those of the coronary arteries without spasm were greater than those of the coronary arteries in patients without ischemic heart disease (p less than 0.01). There were no significant differences between the coronary artery diameters in the two groups after nitrate administration, and the control diameters were less in patients with vasospastic angina than in patients without ischemic heart disease. These observations indicate that a coronary vasomotion disorder, which involves increased basal coronary artery tone and hypersensitivity to vasoconstrictive stimuli, not only at a localized segment but also in the entire coronary artery tree, is present in patients with vasospastic angina. Clinically, evaluation of basal coronary artery tone may be useful for predicting the occurrence and location of coronary artery spasm.\r"

  ".W": "Passive diastolic properties of the left ventricle were determined in 10 control subjects and 12 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Simultaneous left ventricular angiography and high fidelity pressure measurements were performed in all patients. Left ventricular chamber stiffness was calculated from left ventricular pressure-volume and myocardial stiffness from left ventricular stress-strain relations with use of a viscoelastic model. Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were classified into two groups according to the diastolic constant of myocardial stiffness (beta). Group 1 consisted of seven patients with a normal constant of myocardial stiffness less than or equal to 9.6 (normal range 2.2 to 9.6) and group 2 of 5 patients with a beta greater than 9.6. Structural abnormalities (percent interstitial fibrosis, fibrous content) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were assessed by morphometry from right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies. Heart rate was similar in the three groups. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly greater in patients with cardiomyopathy (18 mm Hg in group 1 and 22 mm Hg in group 2) than in the control patients (10 mm Hg). Left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower in groups 1 (37%) and 2 (36%) than in the control patients (66%). Left ventricular muscle mass index was significantly increased in both groups with cardiomyopathy. The constant of chamber stiffness (beta*) was slightly although not significantly greater in groups 1 and 2 (0.58 and 0.58, respectively) than in the control group (0.35). The constant of myocardial stiffness beta was normal in group 1 (7.0; control group 6.9, p = NS) but was significantly increased in group 2 (23.5). Interstitial fibrosis was 19% in group 1 and 43% (p less than 0.001) in group 2 (normal less than or equal to 10%). There was an exponential relation between both diastolic constant of myocardial stiffness (beta) and interstitial fibrosis (IF) (r = 0.95; p less than 0.001) and beta and fibrous content divided by end-diastolic volume index (r = 0.93; p less than 0.001). It is concluded that myocardial stiffness can be normal in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy despite severely depressed systolic function. Structural alterations of the myocardium with increased amounts of fibrous tissues are probably responsible for the observed changes in passive elastic properties of the myocardium in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. The constant of myocardial stiffness (beta) helps to identify patients with severe structural alterations (group 2), representing possibly a more advanced stage of the disease.\r"

Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction averaged 23.3 +/- 9.9%, whereas cardiac output averaged 3.69 +/- 1.03 liters/min, with a pulmonary wedge pressure of 27.4 +/- 8.5 mm Hg. After 48 h of metyrosine administration, plasma norepinephrine concentration decreased from 919.4 +/- 810.6 to 335.4 +/- 143.1 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). Plasma epinephrine concentration averaged 176.4 +/- 166.0 pg/ml at baseline, and was unchanged during metyrosine administration. Despite the significant decrease in circulating norepinephrine, no significant hemodynamic changes were observed during metyrosine administration. These results suggest that high levels of circulating norepinephrine may be more a marker of severe congestive heart failure than an important contributor to the underlying pathophysiology at this advanced stage of the disease process.\r"

  ".W": "In 105 patients with active infective endocarditis, disease-associated complications defined as severe heart failure (New York Heart Association class IV), embolic events and in-hospital death were correlated to the vegetation size determined by both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. A detailed comparison between anatomic and echocardiographic findings, performed in a subgroup of 80 patients undergoing surgery or necropsy, revealed that true valvular vegetations can be reliably identified by echocardiography in the vast majority of patients; the detection rate was significantly higher for the transesophageal (90%) than for the transthoracic (58%) approach, particularly when infected prosthetic valves were evaluated. However, an accurate echocardiographic differentiation between true vegetations and other endocarditis-induced valve destruction (ruptured leaflets or chordae) is impossible. The correlation of vegetation size with endocarditis-associated complications showed that patients with a vegetation diameter greater than 10 mm had a significantly higher incidence of embolic events than did those with a vegetation diameter less than or equal to 10 mm (22 of 47 versus 11 of 58; p less than 0.01). Particularly for patients with mitral valve endocarditis, a vegetation diameter greater than 10 mm was highly sensitive in identifying patients at risk for embolic events. Vegetation size, however, was not significantly different in patients with and without severe heart failure or in patients surviving or dying during acute endocarditis. In addition, no significant correlation was found between vegetation size and location of endocarditis or type of infective organism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Short-axis images of the heart were obtained at end-diastole and at 100 ms intervals thereafter. Regional diastolic left ventricular wall thickness and maximal percent systolic wall thickening were measured at the level of the papillary muscles in each of six segments. In six normal dogs, the mean end-diastolic wall thickness was 9 +/- 1.6 mm, and the mean maximal percent thickening was 61 +/- 11%. In eight dogs with a 4 day old infarct, maximal percent thickening was 5 +/- 8% (p less than 0.001) in the infarcted segments. In 10 normal human volunteers, the mean end-diastolic wall thickness was 10.1 +/- 1 mm, and the mean maximal percent systolic wall thickening was 60 +/- 18%. Reduced maximal percent systolic wall thickening was defined as a value greater than or equal to 2 SD below the mean value obtained in normal volunteers. Seven patients with regional wall motion abnormalities were independently assessed by NMR imaging and biplane ventriculography. With a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 80%, NMR imaging demonstrated reduced maximal percent systolic wall thickening in the same segments identified as akinetic or dyskinetic by biplane ventriculography. Thus, abnormalities of regional systolic wall thickening are accurately identified with this quantitative imaging technique.\r"

Its use has not yet been reported in humans, partly because of difficulties in preparation. With use of the newly modified sonication method, 10 ml of 5% albumin was sonicated for 75 s with a 5.0 ml slow infusion of air. This resulted in microbubbles with a mean diameter (+/- SD) of 5 +/- microns). Fourteen patients undergoing routine coronary angiography were studied. One patient had normal coronary arteries; the other 13 had significant coronary artery disease. In a subgroup of nine patients, sonicated albumin and sonicated diatrizoate meglumine sodium (microbubble diameter 9 +/- 3 microns) were injected several minutes apart, using the same technique. Videodensity-time curves were obtained from a region of interest in the myocardium. Corrected peak contrast intensity (baseline contrast intensity subtracted from peak contrast intensity, gray scale U/pixel) for sonicated albumin and for sonicated diatrizoate meglumine sodium was 51 +/- 26 and 52 +/- 19, respectively (p = 0.89). Washout half-time (T1/2) for the two agents was 5.5 +/- 4.5 and 16.0 +/- 12.2 s, respectively (p = 0.01). One patient with unstable angina experienced transient chest pain after repeated albumin injections. No electrocardiographic changes, blood pressure changes or wall motion abnormalities were observed. Administered by intracoronary injection, sonicated 5% albumin is a safe and effective echocardiographic contrast agent for myocardial perfusion imaging, yielding excellent myocardial contrast with physiologic washout time.\r"

Quantitative texture measurements of the first order (mean gray level, skewness, kurtosis, energy and entropy) overlapped between the two groups. Among the second order statistics variables, entropy was significantly and consistently higher in amyloid versus normal patient data (septum in parasternal long-axis view: 6.3 +/- 0.3 versus 5.9 +/- 0.4; septum in apical four chamber view: 6.2 +/- 0.2 versus 5.8 +/- 0.3). Therefore, amyloid-involved myocardial walls show ultrasound image texture alterations that may be quantified with digital image analysis techniques.\r"

However, their reproducibility in serial studies has not been compared, although this issue is critical to evaluation of regression of hypertrophy. To determine which technique provides more reproducible estimates of left ventricular mass, three serial studies were performed prospectively in each of eight normal adults over 5 months. Both two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiograms were obtained at each of these 24 studies. Measurements were performed by two independent observers who did not know patient identity. For the two-dimensional method, left ventricular mass was determined with use of a computer light-pen system and the truncated ellipsoid formula. For the M-mode method, mass was calculated from Penn convention measurements with use of the cube formula. At study 1 the group mean left ventricular mass by two-dimensional echocardiography (115 +/- 20 g) did not differ from that by M-mode study (127 +/- 37 g, p = NS). However, serial estimates of left ventricular mass were more reproducible by two-dimensional echocardiography. The mean difference among the three serial two-dimensional studies in each individual was 4.8 +/- 4 g (4.2 +/- 3%) by the two-dimensional method, but was 18.5 +/- 13 g (14.9 +/- 10%) by the M-mode method (p = 0.01).

Regurgitant scores of 0, 1, 2 and 3 were assigned to pulsed Doppler patterns corresponding to no, mild, moderate and severe mitral regurgitation, respectively. Before balloon aortic valvuloplasty, mitral regurgitant score correlated significantly (p less than 0.005) but weakly with aortic valve area (r = -0.24), left ventricular ejection fraction (r = -0.34) and left ventricular systolic pressure (r = 0.23). There was no significant correlation between mitral regurgitation and either mean catheterization or mean Doppler aortic valve gradient. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty produced significant decreases in both catheterization and Doppler mean transvalvular aortic valve gradients (56 +/- 19 to 31 +/- 12 and 60 +/- 19 to 48 +/- 16 mm Hg, respectively; both p less than 0.0001) and a significant increase (p less than 0.0001) in aortic valve area assessed by catheterization (0.6 +/- 0.2 to 0.9 +/- 0.3 cm2).

Pulsed Doppler findings of mitral regurgitation were present in 102 of the 144 patients. Eighty-eight patients had a score compatible with mild or more severe degrees of mitral regurgitation, and 49 had a score indicative of moderate or severe valvular insufficiency.

  ".W": "Previous studies from this laboratory demonstrated that in healthy young men, cardiac output is closely coupled to oxygen uptake during dynamic exercise, regardless of its mode or relative intensity, whereas other physiologic responses such as heart rate, blood pressure and ventilation are inversely related to the size of the active muscle mass when expressed as functions of oxygen uptake. The purpose of the current investigation was to determine whether congestive heart failure alters the pattern of physiologic responses to various modes of arm and leg exercise in proportion to the size of the active muscle mass. Cardiopulmonary responses to four modes of dynamic work (one arm curl, one arm cycle ergometry, one leg cycle ergometry and two leg cycle ergometry) were characterized in terms of absolute and relative intensities (oxygen uptake and mode-specific percent of peak oxygen uptake, respectively) in middle-aged men with congestive heart failure and control groups of healthy subjects and patients after myocardial infarction without heart failure. Peak oxygen uptake was reduced to the greatest extent in patients with heart failure for large muscle mass work (-13% for curl, -32% for one arm and one leg cycle ergometry and -37% for two leg cycle ergometry; p less than 0.05 versus the normal group for the three modes of ergometry). This finding was paralleled by a markedly blunted slope for the cardiac output-oxygen uptake relation for leg but not arm exercise that was only partially compensated for by a widened arteriovenous oxygen difference. Blood pressure expressed as a function of oxygen uptake remained inversely related to active muscle mass size in all groups of subjects despite attenuation of systolic pressure for heavy large muscle mass effort in the group with heart failure. Pulmonary ventilation at a given metabolic rate was not influenced by active muscle mass size. Thus, saturation of capacity for systemic oxygen transport occurs in conjunction with blunted cardiac output reserve in patients with heart failure during exercise involving a smaller muscle mass than in healthy subjects. The basic inverse relation between size of the active muscle mass and blood pressure at a given metabolic rate is not altered by aging or reduced cardiac reserve. The muscle mass effect on ventilation seen in young healthy subjects disappears with aging.\r"

  ".W": "It was hypothesized that in acute inferior wall myocardial infarction, an additional ischemic area in the subendocardium of the noninfarcting territory would produce a selective current dipole between the infarcting and ischemic regions. A resistance network model to calculate epicardial potentials from body surface electrocardiographic potentials was developed and used to examine the hypothesis in 219 patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction. In the learning set of 110 patients, two characteristic dipole patterns were observed, each associated with a high mortality rate in the ensuing 15 months when compared with that in the remaining patients. In the test set of 109 patients, a double-blind analysis of the patterns showed that the 34 patients with a dipole pattern had a collective mortality rate of 35% at 15 months compared with a 15 month rate of 5% in the remaining patients. In the total group of 219 patients, the magnitude of ST segment elevation and both the magnitude and integral of the area voltage of ST depression on the epicardium were significantly correlated with the mortality rate (p less than 0.0002 for all variables against death at 15 months). This study strongly suggests that ST depression due to ischemia can be differentiated from ST depression secondary to the ST elevation in acute inferior infarction by the examination of epicardial potential distributions.\r"

Coronary artery disease was documented in 11 patients, dilated cardiomyopathy in 2 and no structural heart disease in the remaining 4 patients. The initial presentation was aborted sudden cardiac death (five patients), syncope (eight patients) and symptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (four patients). The antiarrhythmic drug that rendered the initial ventricular tachyarrhythmias noninducible was class IA in 11 cases, class IC in 5 and combined class IA and IB in 1. The original ventricular tachyarrhythmia became reinducible in 10 patients (group A) and remained noninducible in 7 patients (group B) after isoproterenol infusion at a rate necessary to achieve a 20% increase in heart rate. Despite the results of isoproterenol challenge, all patients were maintained on their electrophysiologically guided antiarrhythmic regimen. During a mean follow-up period of 13 +/- 9 months, 3 of the 10 patients in group A experienced clinical recurrence of tachyarrhythmia; no recurrence was noted in group B. In conclusion, reinducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmia after beta-adrenergic stimulation seems to identify a subgroup of patients at high risk of subsequent arrhythmic events. Beta-adrenergic blockade or surgical therapy may be indicated in some patients with a positive isoproterenol challenge.\r"

To test this premise, a prospective randomized intraoperative evaluation of defibrillation efficacy of monophasic and biphasic waveform pulses was performed in 22 survivors of out of hospital ventricular fibrillation who were undergoing cardiac surgery for implantation of an automatic defibrillator. The initial waveform used in a patient for defibrillation testing, either monophasic or biphasic, was randomly selected. Subsequently, each patient served as his or her own control for defibrillation testing of the other waveform. The defibrillation threshold was defined as the lowest pulse amplitude that would effectively terminate ventricular fibrillation with a single discharge delivered 10 s after initiation of an episode of ventricular fibrillation induced with alternating current. Each defibrillation pulse was recorded oscilloscopically, and defibrillation pulse voltage, current, resistance and stored energy were measured. Fifteen (68%) of the 22 patients had a lower defibrillation threshold with the biphasic pulse, 3 (14%) had a lower threshold with the monophasic pulse and 4 (18%) had equal defibrillation thresholds (within 1.0 J) regardless of waveform. The mean leading edge defibrillation threshold voltage was 317 +/- 105 V when the monophasic pulse was used and 267 +/- 102 V (16% less) when the biphasic pulse was used (p = 0.008).

In each child, noninvasive evaluation included a chest X-ray film, computed tomography of the chest and two-dimensional echocardiography. The presence and size of an aortic aneurysm were determined quantitatively by measuring the ratio of the diameter of the thoracic aorta at the repair site to the diameter of the aorta at the diaphragm (aortic ratio). An aortic ratio of greater than or equal to 1.5 was judged abnormal and was shown to be significantly greater than the aortic ratio of a normal control group. An aortogram was obtained in each child if any noninvasive screening test was found to be abnormal. As assessed by the aortogram, the prevalence of aortic aneurysm was 24% in this patient group. The sensitivity of echocardiography and chest computed tomography for detecting an aneurysm was 71% and 66%, and the specificity 76% and 85%, respectively. The chest X-ray film was 100% sensitive and 68% specific in determining the presence of an aneurysm. Although the data are not statistically significant, they suggest that children undergoing patch aortoplasty as the primary procedure (rather than a reoperation after earlier resection), and children in whom a Dacron patch is utilized may be at increased risk for aneurysm formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Familial cardiovascular malformations encountered can be grouped into five distinct etiologic mechanisms. Single gene effects may be responsible for the specific histologic and biochemical changes in familial atrial septal defect with conduction disturbance and also in idiopathic ventricular hypertrophy. Left heart lesions showed familial concordance by the presumed morphogenetic mechanism of abnormal embryonic blood flow with phenotypes of varying severity. Pulmonary stenosis appeared with familial heritable disorders, as well as a partially concordant lesion with tetralogy of Fallot. Ventricular septal defect with transposition of the great arteries (one sibling pair) and with truncus arteriosus (two sibling pairs) indicate forme fruste expression of conotruncal defects. Endocardial cushion defect occurred with and without Down's syndrome in members of three families, suggesting inheritance of a defect affecting cellular migration. Heritable blood coagulopathies occurred in case families and not in control families. The associated of hemophilia and transposition, observed also by others, is extremely unlikely by chance and suggests genetic errors of endothelial cell function. The description of specific families from a population-based study emphasizes biologic questions on the nature of the inheritance of cardiovascular malformations.\r"

  ".W": "The inducibility and reproducibility of ventricular tachycardia were evaluated in 97 dogs after myocardial infarction produced by single stage coronary artery ligation. Arrhythmia induction was performed with use of an endocardial electrode catheter positioned at the right ventricular apex before each study. An aggressive protocol of programmed stimulation was used, employing up to seven extrastimuli and three attempts at arrhythmia induction in each study. Electrophysiologic study was performed in individual dogs at the following times after infarction: 1) 7.7 +/- 0.3 and 15 +/- 0.2 days (34 consecutive dogs); 2) 14 +/- 0.6 and 26 +/- 1.7 days (24 selected dogs); 19 +/- 2 and 43 +/- 3 days (12 selected dogs); 4) 36 +/- 2 and 60 +/- 6 days (8 selected dogs); and 5) 59 +/- 12 and 130 +/- 10 days (3 selected dogs). Inducibility of ventricular tachycardia decreased significantly from 74% 1 week after infarction to 41% 2 weeks after infarction. Thus, early reproducibility was low (48%). Reproducibility increased thereafter, with 88% of the dogs having reproducible ventricular tachycardia between 2 and 4 weeks (p less than 0.025) and 100% having reproducibly inducible ventricular tachycardia between 4 weeks and 4 months after infarction. Dogs with no inducible arrhythmia early after infarction did not develop inducible ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation at later studies. Twelve dogs developed spontaneous ventricular tachycardia or sudden arrhythmic death late after infarction. Overall, 22% of dogs with inducible ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length greater than 140 ms developed spontaneous ventricular tachycardia or sudden death. Arrhythmia induction decreases significantly during the 1st 2 weeks after myocardial infarction, but long-term reproducibility of ventricular tachycardia induced greater than or equal to 2 weeks after infarction is very high. This canine model of long-term, reliably inducible ventricular tachycardia is suitable for investigation of antiarrhythmic drugs, surgery and other interventions.\r"

  ".W": "Aortic flow and pressure relations and aortic diameter were examined during sinus rhythm, internal cardiac massage, vest cardiopulmonary resuscitation, conventional manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation and high impulse manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 14 anesthetized large dogs. During sinus rhythm and during internal cardiac massage, ascending aortic flow and pressure increased simultaneously and the rise in ascending aorta pressure preceded the rise in descending aortic pressure by (mean +/- SEM) 28 +/- 4 and 30 +/- 1 ms, respectively. In contrast, during vest, conventional and high impulse cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ascending aortic flow lagged behind the initial rise in aortic pressure by 40 +/- 4 to 46 +/- 4 ms and ascending and descending aortic pressure increased simultaneously (p less than 0.001 for each external compression mode versus sinus rhythm and internal massage). The ratio of pulse pressure to stroke volume increased by an order of magnitude during all modes of external chest compression (p less than 0.001 versus sinus rhythm and internal massage) and aortic diameter decreased during vest and high impulse cardiopulmonary resuscitation (p less than 0.05 versus sinus rhythm and internal massage). The hemodynamics of external chest compression depart from the normal physiologic sequence of stroke volume-induced increase in aortic pressure and diameter. The rise in aortic pressure precedes flow into the aorta, stroke volume does not fully account for pulse pressure, and aortic diameter decreases during chest compression. These data support the hypothesis that blood flow is due to fluctuations in intrathoracic pressure for high impulse as well as vest and conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\r"

To test the usefulness of this technique in experimental models of murine myocarditis, the culture and characterization of lymphocytes from mice infected with encephalomyocarditis virus or coxsackievirus B3 were studied. Lymphocytes were successfully cultured from three hearts of encephalomyocarditis virus-infected mice in interleukin 2-containing culture. After approximately 10 days, lymphocytes migrated out of myocardium in the chronic stage of myocarditis and gradually increased in numbers. More than half of the exuding cells were Thy 1.2-positive. None of the myocardial samples from coxsackievirus B3-infected mice grew out lymphocytes. Pathologic examination of all specimens showed myocardial necrosis with lymphoid infiltration. Although further studies are needed, this preliminary study suggests that the technique of lymphocyte culture may promote new insights into the pathogenesis of experimental myocarditis.\r"

Factors examined included the number and academic background of faculty members teaching food science, the structure of the first course in food science, the structure of advanced food science courses required or offered to undergraduate dietetic students, and perceived adequacy of course content. Fifty-eight percent of the respondents had or were candidates for doctoral degrees, and 37% had master's degrees. The results indicated that although all programs offered a beginning course in food science, the required prerequisites and level of difficulty of subject matter varied. Fifty-three percent of the programs required at least one advanced food science course. More than 95% of both beginning and advanced courses are structured to include both lecture and laboratory. Although a majority of respondents indicated satisfaction with the adequacy of course content currently being offered, many made recommendations for improvements. Other concerns included difficulty in locating textbooks and other suitable instructional materials, isolation from others teaching food science, and a lack of standards for content to be included in basic and advanced courses.\r"

FFF combined nutrition education, a low-fat dietary pattern, exercise, behavioral self-management, and social support in a program designed to serve the general population of overweight and obese adults. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 84 and from ideal weight to massively obese. After enrolling, program participants attended professionally led weekly meetings as long as they wished. Participants were encouraged to keep daily food diaries, to reduce the proportion of calories from fat to 30% or less, to exercise at moderate intensity for 30 minutes a day 5 days a week, to keep graphic records of weight change and exercise, and to display their graphs at each weekly group meeting. Attrition rates were comparatively low for a large-scale program, with half of the participants still active in the fifth month and 22% still active after 1 year. Mean weight loss for obese participants (BMI 30 or greater) at 6 months was 7.3 kg (16.2 lb) for men and 5.3 kg (11.6 lb) for women. The best predictors of weight loss at 6 months were number of days per week in which food diaries were kept, baseline body mass index, number of minutes of exercise per week, and age.\r"

A 2-year follow-up study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a behavioral weight control program on 123 obese male and 386 obese female subjects. Body weights were measured by dietitians at baseline and after an 8-week treatment program. Two-year follow-up weights were self-reported from a mailed questionnaire. The subjects' mean weight at baseline was 185.6 +/- 43.4 lb (no. = 509). Their mean percent over ideal body weight at baseline was 29.7%. Following an 8-week treatment period, mean weight was 176.4 +/- 41.3 lb (no. = 509), yielding a mean weight loss of 9.2 +/- 6.4 lb. Weight change after the 8-week treatment period ranged from a loss of 37 lb to a gain of 5 lb.

To determine whether such patients have adopted recommended dietary practices, we analyzed data collected in 1986 from telephone surveys of adults in 26 states (no. = 34,395). The self-reported dietary practices that we evaluated were: use of table salt, alcohol consumption, and weight control practices. In comparison with persons who did not have hypertension (no. = 26,848), those with hypertension who were receiving pharmacological therapy (\"treated hypertensives,\" no. = 5,025) were more likely to report limiting their use of table salt (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5) and were less likely to have their weight controlled (OR = 0.4). Although overweight persons with hypertension were more likely than persons with normal blood pressure to attempt to lose weight, most have not included exercise in their weight loss efforts. There was no difference between persons who do not have hypertension and treated patients with hypertension in their use of alcohol. Untreated persons with hypertension (no. = 2,378) were less likely to limit their use of table salt and less likely to moderate their use of alcohol than treated persons with hypertension but otherwise reported similar dietary practices. Dietetic practitioners may need to emphasize moderation of alcohol use and the use of physical activity to lose weight when counseling patients with hypertension.\r"

Intakes of calcium, iron, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, protein, vitamin A, and vitamin C were compared with the 1980 RDAs for age and sex. A dietary adequacy score was developed to evaluate nutrient quality by calculation of a nutrient density ratio (total intake for a nutrient divided by the RDA). A value of one was considered the norm. A score of 0.67 or less was considered an inadequate nutrient intake. Sixty-eight percent of the sample demonstrated some degree of inadequate nutrient intake. Nutrients that tended to be the lowest were calcium (76% inadequate), vitamin C (74% inadequate), and thiamin (74% inadequate). Inadequate nutrient intake was significantly associated with a lack of cooking facilities, lower monthly incomes, and lesser amounts of money spent on food. Comparison of food pantry users with soup kitchen participants indicated calcium was a problem nutrient for both groups.\r"

Intake by the runners exceeded two-thirds of the Recommended Dietary Allowance for all nutrients except vitamin D and zinc in female runners. Energy and nutrient intake levels in the marathon runners were higher than those of the general U.S. population except for total fat, vitamin B-12, and zinc in both men and women and sodium in men. In general, runners consumed better diets than the general population. However, both caloric intake and percent energy as carbohydrate were lower than recommended for individuals engaging in endurance exercise. The need for professional help in planning high-carbohydrate diets for runners is indicated. Increasing amounts of training were not associated with significant increases in nutrient densities across three activity categories within this group of runners. However, more than 75% of the runners perceived their diets to be much improved after they began regular training (men 8.2 +/- 0.3 years of running experience, women 6.7 +/- 0.6). Together, these data suggest that regular moderate-to-heavy endurance exercise is associated with a better quantity and quality of nutrient intake than that found in the general population, which may in part be related to the adoption of such exercise by previously sedentary individuals.\r"

Examples are given of the application of the readability program in the development of one diet booklet and in the simplification of four other booklets. Without the readability formulas, the reading level of the materials would have remained above the stated educational levels of the target population, and the objectives of the booklets would not have been achieved. Cautions against overreliance on the readability formulas without other assessment steps are given. A systematic approach including readability assessment is needed to ensure the effectiveness of dietetic educational materials.\r"

Standards were developed for the quality and quantity of nutrition care, time required to provide nutrition care, and utilization of dietitians' time. Computer software was developed to report the volume of services provided, the need for services, and the utilization of labor hours. Data were evaluated to determine whether services were consistent with standards and to calculate a recommended number of clinical dietitian full-time equivalents for the hospital. Furthermore, the management information system was instrumental in developing a fee-for-service structure, for evenly distributing work loads among dietitians, and for monitoring adherence to standards of care.\r"

Overall, students thought they were better able to identify what it was like to make major dietary changes, especially when those changes are imposed by someone else. They had an increased awareness of the feelings of deprivation that patients might experience when foods become restricted. The students also believed that they would be more understanding when counseling patients and make more diligent efforts to individualize the diet as much as possible. Some thought they had a better understanding of noncompliance and would now be more empathic toward their patients. Assessing the changes required and the degree of difficulty experienced helped the students bring what had been learned conceptually to a conscious awareness.\r"

Thirteen possible noneconomic or personal benefits and six possible economic or professional benefits were rated on a scale of 1, little or no benefit, to 5, great benefit. The highest ratings on noneconomic benefits were 4.43 expected and 3.95 actual on the benefit of \"becoming informed about some subject\". On economic benefits, the highest ratings were 4.36 expected and 3.82 actual on \"learning recent job knowledge.\" The overall noneconomic ratings were 2.85 expected and 2.78 actual. On economic benefits, the overall ratings were 3.46 expected and 3.07 actual. Dietitians ranked \"expertise of instructors\" and \"instructor's ability to explain or demonstrate\" as the two highest perceived strengths of the continuing education experience. Obviously, the instructor is viewed as an important factor in continuing education. Dietitians rated their degree of participation in continuing experiences in the following descending order: \"contributing to the evaluation process\", \"sharing experiences with others,\" and \"developing goals and ideas.\"\r"

The injections were intended to reverse (2-week treatments) or prevent (6-month treatments) deleterious effects of aging on skeletal muscle--specifically the loss of fast fibers during the latter part of the life span. However, measurements of myosin ATPase (and subsequent histochemical fiber type determinations) revealed that the previously reported age-related decrease in ATPase activities and fast fiber content did not occur in barrier-protected specific pathogen free rats or mice. None of the treatments used had a significant effect on the ATPase activity or fiber composition of soleus, extensor digitorum longus, or diaphragm muscles, although parallel determinations in collaborating laboratories verified that the hormones had major effects in other systems. Previously reported decreases with age in ATPase activity of heart muscle were confirmed in our experiments, and these decreases were shown to reflect a change in myosin isozyme composition of the hearts, both at the protein and the mRNA levels of gene expression.\r"

In a nondiabetic population with an age range 22-80 years, there was a significant negative correlation between the rate of DNA unwinding and the age of the individual with an r of 0.60 (p less than .001). The rate of alkaline digestion of double-stranded DNA (ds DNA) in the elderly diabetics (n = 26, 65-80 yrs) was significantly lower than that in the nondiabetic, age-matched ambulatory elderly. Within the healthy group studied, there was a statistically significant correlation between the rate of DNA unwinding and plasma glucose concentration (p less than .05) or glycosylated hemoglobin A1C levels (p less than .0001). The availability of WBC and the relative ease and rapidity of the technique employed make this a potentially useful biological marker of aging.\r"

An important addition to this form of assessment is the use of performance measures of physical function, in which individuals are asked to actually perform specific tasks and are evaluated using standardized criteria. Although there has been limited methodological work on physical performance instruments, this approach offers a number of potential advantages. Several performance assessments have been developed that correlate highly with other measures of health status and predict need for long-term care and mortality. It is suggested that more widespread use be made of physical performance assessments and that they be evaluated as measures of functioning in cross-national studies, as indicators of change in functioning over time, as endpoints in intervention studies, as tools for identifying persons functioning at high levels, and as sources of relevant information for the clinician.\r"

Subjects were randomly assigned to an Aerobic Exercise group, a Yoga and Flexibility control group, or a Waiting List control group. Prior to and following the 4-month program, subjects underwent comprehensive physiological and psychological evaluations. Physiological measures included measurement of blood pressure, lipids, bone density, and cardiorespiratory fitness including direct measurements of peak oxygen consumption (VO2) and anaerobic threshold. Psychological measures included measures of mood, psychiatric symptoms, and neuropsychological functioning. This study demonstrated that 4 months of aerobic exercise training produced an overall 11.6% improvement in peak VO2 and a 13% increase in anaerobic threshold. In contrast, the Yoga and Waiting List control groups experienced no change in cardiorespiratory fitness. Other favorable physiological changes observed among aerobic exercise participants included lower cholesterol levels, diastolic blood pressure levels, and for subjects at risk for bone fracture, a trend toward an increase in bone mineral content. Although few significant psychological changes could be attributed to aerobic exercise training, participants in the two active treatment groups perceived themselves as improving on a number of psychological and behavioral dimensions.\r"

The younger adults had a more vigorous reflex response than the older adults, as indicated by peak force. Force latencies were also faster for the younger adults than the older adults. However, both age groups showed a long-latency facilitation of quadriceps excitability regardless of cutaneous stimulation site. Thus, it seems that low threshold cutaneous afferents contribute an excitatory input to the extensor motoneuron pool that is maintained with age.\r"

Results did not support hypothesis (a) but offered some equivocal support for hypothesis (b), inasmuch as aged subjects with higher levels of PLMs had delayed motor and sensory latencies in the upper limbs (median n., ulnar n.).

After one hour of supine rest, healthy young and elderly subjects had similar beta-adrenergic receptor density and cAMP responses to isoproterenol. After 10 min of standing, beta-adrenergic receptor density and cAMP response increased in the young subjects. Elderly subjects had a similar increase in cAMP responses after standing, but no change in beta-adrenergic receptor density. Lymphocyte subsets and percent monocytes were not altered by age or posture, suggesting that this was not an artifact of changes in cell populations. Incubation in vitro of cells from both groups with catecholamines, at concentrations comparable to those achieved in plasma after standing, resulted in enhanced isoproterenol-mediated cAMP responses, but no change in beta-adrenergic receptor density. These data suggest that acute regulation of adrenergic signaling is affected by age, mediated in part by catecholamines, and may be relevant in the study of acute cardiovascular regulation.\r"

Analyses were further replicated by splitting both samples in half. The model fit well and compared favorably to other alternative specifications. In addition to this analysis of internal structure, the model was also examined in relation to several exogenous factors including age, sex, race, education, and physical health. While the model again fit well, a model with cognitive deficit separate from the other factors seemed more reasonable.\r"

MMSE data were available for 86 patients who met DSM-III criteria for primary degenerative dementia -- possible or probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). A logistic regression analysis of the probability of correct performance on an item, given the total MMSE score, yielded statistics for difficulty and discrimination. These statistics were interpreted respectively as indicators of the point in the progression of the illness at which the mental function tested by that item is lost and the rapidity of that loss. The data indicated a systematic progression of the development of symptoms in AD related to decline of memory function. Temporal orientation was lost before spatial and object orientation, and recollection of words was lost before ability to repeat them. ICC can help to delineate the loss of mental functions during the course of AD.\r"

This study examined age-related changes in the ability to perceive one's direction of self-motion, or heading, from optical flow, using computer displays that simulate translational or curvilinear movement parallel to a random-dot ground surface. We found small but significant decrements in performance with age, such that the mean heading threshold rises from 1.1 degrees in younger observers to 1.9 degrees in older observers for translation, and from 1.4 degrees to 2.9 degrees for curvilinear movement, under comparable dot density and speed conditions. The absence of an age by dot density interaction indicates that there is no age-related shift in strategy, but rather a general decline in the ability to detect and localize global optical flow patterns. The decrement appears to be due to higher level losses in the visual system rather than ocular or low-level sensory losses. The results may have implications for the control of high-speed locomotion and falls in older adults.\r"

Results indicate that asocial and disoriented behaviors have linear relationships with levels of burden, specific mental health problems attributed to caregiving, and the extent to which caregivers sacrificed aspects of their social life. Asocial behaviors were also linearly related to overall level of caregiver depression. Forgetful behaviors, on the other hand, have relationships with burden, specific mental health problems attributed to caregiving, and social change that are nonlinear. Data are interpreted in terms of the predictable course of Alzheimer's disease and associated role expectations.\r"

Accelerated failure time equations are estimated to determine the relationships between age and duration without work following job loss. Regression equations explaining subsequent earnings also are estimated. Although older workers have lower overall unemployment rates than younger workers, those displaced due to a plant closing or move do not fare as well as their younger counterparts. Median length of unemployment for those age 55 and over was 27 weeks, which compared unfavorably to the 13 weeks found for workers under age 45. When controlling for other worker characteristics, older workers were found to experience more than four additional weeks of unemployment and earn less upon reemployment than younger workers.\r"

In the second example, taken from a cross-national study of elderly residents in long-stay institutions in New York and London, scale items suspected of bias due to interviewer variability and to cross-national differences in institutional environments are identified. It is shown that estimated rates of impairment are affected by presence of variant (biased) items. We argue that latent trait methods are useful for identifying biased items and may have wide application in gerontological research.\r"

We examined the influence of calcium transport inhibitors, lanthanum and diltiazem hydrochloride, on allergic contact dermatitis induced by 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB) in BALB/c mice. Systemic lanthanum at a dose of 0.08 mg/kg and topical lanthanum (50 microliters of 10% solution) were given 5 d before DNCB sensitization. Systemic diltiazem (30 mg/kg per dy) was given for 3 d during sensitization with DNCB. In all animals, challenge with topical DNCB to the ear skin was performed 5 d after sensitization and ear swelling was measured. Twenty four hours post-DNCB challenge, animals receiving systemic lanthanum demonstrated a 56% decrease in contact hypersensitivity (ear swelling) compared with non-lanthanum-treated animals (0.08 +/- 0.03 mm vs 0.18 mm +/- 0.02 mm, p less than 0.01). Topical lanthanum produced a 58% decrease in contact hypersensitivity (0.20 +/- 0.02 mm vs 0.41 +/- 0.03 mm, p less than 0.01). The DNCB-induced ear swelling also resolved more quickly in animals treated with lanthanum. Systemic diltiazem produced a 67% decrease in ear swelling (0.05 +/- 0.01 mm vs 0.15 +/- 0.02 mm, p less than 0.001). A decrease in epidermal Langerhans cell density of 13 to 14% was produced by systemic lanthanum, detected by both ATPase staining and Ia staining, respectively (p less than 0.05). Approximately 20% of the Langerhans cells were morphologically abnormal, having become \"rounded,\" and lacking normal dendritic processes. From these results, we infer that calcium transport across the cell membrane of ELC may be important in the regulation of their function. Lanthanides and other calcium-channel blockers may be useful pharmacologic agents to probe these phenomena.\r"

This was carried out on microtiter culture plates, using an anti-Thy-1 monoclonal antibody, to determine the attachment of murine T lymphocytes and an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-IgM antibody to measure B cell binding. Both types of lymphocyte were found to adhere strongly to intact human fibroblasts, and also had high levels of attachment to purified fibroblast plasma membranes and extracts of the fibroblast extracellular matrix. Attachment, particularly of B lymphocytes, also took place onto plastic surfaces coated with fibronectin, but not to collagens or to intact fibroblasts that had been fixed with a low concentration of paraformaldehyde. Lymphocyte binding to fibroblasts was partially prevented by a monoclonal antibody against fibroblast MHC class II antigens, but not against the class I membrane complex, or by polyclonal antiserum to the cell surface mannose 6-phosphate receptor. In addition, although both lymphocyte types were able to adhere to fibro-nectin, the presence of antibody against fibronectin or the synthetic peptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser, had no effect on their attachment to fibroblasts. Thus, lymphocyte adhesion may occur by fibronectin, but other types of interactions with fibroblasts also appear to take place.\r"

Net yields of T*T photoproducts were determined in 10 individuals, with the majority (7 of 10) between 0.02 and 0.12 T*T per kilobase (Kb). The three remaining individuals had higher levels of photoproducts but were not unusually sensitive to solar UV as determined by minimal erythema dose (MED). Percentage loss of T*T photoproducts 4 h after exposure was determined in nine individuals to be 80.2 +/- 14.0%.\r"

Accordingly, we have used a mechanical device that records the torsional extensibility of the skin. When submitted to a low torque, the time-response curve of the skin affords the determination of the immediate extensibility (UE), the immediate recovery (UR), the viscoelastic part of the deformation (UV), the elastic recovery (UR/UE), and the creep relaxation time (tau). Because the skin thickness varies with age and primarily governs the mechanical properties, it was measured through an ultrasound technique at the same sites (forearm) where the torque was applied. The results show that the skin maintains its thickness and extensibility up to the seventh decade as opposed to its elasticity or recovery capacities, which decrease from an early age. The viscous part of the deformation is constant through life, whereas the creep relaxation time decreases linearily with age. Except for skin thickness, no differences in these parameters between men and women were detected. The significance of these results are discussed in terms of structure alterations. The determination of the elastic recovery (UR/UE) appears to be a parameter of choice for illustrating skin aging.\r"

The method uses Verhoeff-van Gieson stained sections. The analysis is stratified vertically in three uniform layers starting at the dermo-epidermal junction and horizontally by two schemes. A standard method consists of five equally spaced measurements. The densest method uses the three areas that contain the most elastic tissue. The area fractions are determined by counting the positive and total pixels (thresholding). A validity test utilizing independent physical measurements demonstrated differences of no more than 1.7%. Reliability tests for reading the same section on different days and adjacent sections showed no significant differences (p less than 0.05) between the readings. Reliability tests of sections using different stain lots and adjacent biopsy sites also did not have significant differences. This method may be particularly useful for studies in which the distribution of the material to be measured may be very uneven, such as in solar elastosis.\r"

Topical application of these retinoids produced dose-dependent inhibition of the TPA-induced epidermal DNA synthesis as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation at 15 h after TPA application. However, this inhibition was only transient and did not affect the corresponding increase in epidermal cell layers measured at 40 or 70 h after TPA application. Fluocinonide also inhibited the epidermal DNA synthesis and failed to block TPA-induced epidermal hyperplasia. However, fluocinonide did effectively suppress the inflammation caused by TPA. In this paper we have shown that the suppression of TPA-stimulated DNA synthesis is a general property of topically applied retinoids. The biologic significance of a temporary suppression of TPA-stimulated epidermal DNA synthesis by the retinoids and fluocinonide is not understood at this time.\r"

The hyperemia due to arterial occlusion for 2 min was measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry. If the hyperemic response was absent, the measurements were repeated after vasodilatation was induced by hand warming in warm water. Reactive hyperemia was absent in 12 patients when investigations were performed on the unwarmed hand, and these patients had very low resting blood flows. After vasodilatation was induced in these patients, and also in those patients whose resting blood flow was normal, hyperemic responses were comparable in magnitude with those in the controls. The slope of the hyperemic response was significantly less in the patients (1.11 +/- 0.02 V/s) than in the controls (1.28 +/- 0.03 V/s), and therefore, the time course of the hyperemia was lengthened in the patients with SSc, with a delay to achieving maximum blood flow of 2 min. Peak blood flow was directly related to the level of the initial blood flow. These findings support the view that reactive hyperemia is principally a mechanical phenomenon, and also that vessel wall reactivity is abnormal in SSc, producing delayed hyperemic responses. The magnitude of the hyperemia depends on initial flow rates, and the apparent lack of these responses in SSc is a result of their low, but reversible, resting blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of pig epidermal sheets to the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate (PMA) resulted in an increase in forskolin-induced cyclic AMP accumulation in the epidermis. Cholera toxin-induced cyclic AMP accumulation was moderately increased by PMA treatment, but this was not statistically significant. On the other hand, receptor-mediated adenylate cyclase responses (beta-adrenergic-, prostaglandin E-, adenosine-, and histamine (H2)-adenylate cyclase responses) were significantly decreased. These PMA-induced effects on the epidermal adenylate cyclase system were mimicked by 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol, a membrane-permeable synthetic diacylglycerol, and by the non-phorbol PKC activator, mezerein. 4-O-methyl PMA, a very weak PKC activator, had no effect on adenylate cyclase responses of the epidermis. The addition of the PKC inhibitor, H-7 (1-(5-isoquinoline-sulfonyl)-2-methyl piperazine dihydrochloride), to the incubation medium significantly inhibited the effect of PMA on forskolin-induced cyclic AMP accumulation. Furthermore, following H-7 treatment, the epidermal receptor-adenylate cyclase responses were significantly increased. These results indicate that PKC modulates epidermal adenylate cyclase responses resulting in an increase in forskolin-induced cyclic AMP accumulation and a decrease in receptor-adenylate cyclase responses of the epidermis.\r"

In order to improve the detection of DNA aneuploidy in malignant melanomas, and to minimize diploid non-tumor cells in the sample, we developed a two-color staining strategy for S100 protein and DNA content in paraffin embedded samples. The ability to detect aneuploidy, defined as DNA ploidy index less than or equal to 0.90 or greater than or equal to 1.10, in 37 stage I malignant melanoma samples by flow cytometry analysis was significantly improved from 10.8% of cases using traditional one-color analysis for DNA content only (propidium iodide) to 32.4% of cases using two-color analysis for simultaneous measurement of both DNA (propidium iodide) and S100 protein (fluorescein conjugated antibody) (Chi-square with Yates' correction; p less than 0.05). The largest increase in sensitivity was found in level I and II melanomas less than or equal to 0.76 mm in thickness. In addition, we report the new observation that multiple S100 protein-positive subpopulations were found significantly more frequently in malignant melanomas (23/37 cases) than in compound melanocytic nevi (5/22 cases) (Chi-square with Yates' correction; p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that there is a previously unsuspected degree of tumor heterogeneity even in thin, presumably early, malignant melanomas.\r"

  ".W": "C5a and its degradation product, C5a des Arg, elicit immediate cutaneous inflammatory reactions after intradermal injection. Histologically, these reactions are characterized by neutrophil-rich leukocytic infiltrates, leukocytoclasis, edema, and dermal mast cell degranulation. It has not been possible to assess in vivo the relative contributions of resident mast cells and circulating leukocytes to this reaction because the accumulation of leukocytes and degranulation of mast cells occur simultaneously after injection of these anaphylatoxins. To assess the role of mast cells in these inflammatory reactions, we have examined the reactivity of human skin selectively depleted of dermal mast cells by local corticosteroid treatment. Corticosteroid-treated skin became virtually devoid of dermal mast cells within 4-6 wk as assessed by light microscopy, immunofluorescence with fluorescein-conjugated avidin, or electron microscopy. Mast cell-depleted skin demonstrated normal vasopermeability and vasodilatory responsiveness to intradermal injection of histamine, but the reactivity of these sites to the mast cell secretagogue, morphine, was absent. Moreover, no clinical reactions were detectable in mast cell-depleted human skin after intradermal challenge with 50 ng of either C5a or C5a des Arg, despite the fact that biopsies of these sites revealed substantial, neutrophil-rich infiltrates. These infiltrates were qualitatively and quantitatively identical to C5a or C5a des Arg-induced infiltrates in mast cell replete skin. This experimental approach in vivo has allowed the independent analysis of the anaphylactogenic and chemoattractant activities of human C5a and C5a des Arg in human skin, demonstrated the importance of dermal mast cells in these clinical responses, and shown that leukocytes can accumulate at these injection sites directly in response to these mediators.\r"

  ".W": "Although mast cells have been implicated in mediating antitumor activity, the kinetics, mechanism(s), and suspectibility of different tumors to mast cell-mediated cytotoxicity have not been defined. Rat connective tissue mast cells (CTMC) of greater than or equal to 99% purity were investigated in vitro and found to express maximal spontaneous cytotoxicity against the mouse fibrosarcoma cell line WEHI-164 (56.0% +/- 2.1 SEM), the ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced, cutaneous fibrosarcoma 5C25 (34.7% +/- 3.4 SEM), and the human renal cell tumor Currie (26.8% +/- 2.0 SEM) at an effector to target (E:T) ratio of 80:1. Kinetic studies of CTMC-mediated cytotoxicity demonstrated significant detectable lysis against these tumors within 8 h, which was maximal by 16 h. Binding experiments showed that CTMC formed conjugates with all three lytic-sensitive targets; however, CTMC also attached to the lytic-resistant target YAC-1, indicating that conjugate formation alone is not sufficient for mast cell-mediated cytotoxicity. At two different concentrations, mast cell granules (MCG) lysed WEHI-164 (36.5% +/- 6.8 SEM) and 5C25 (34.4% +/- 6.9 SEM), but were only slightly cytotoxic (5.7% +/- 2.9 SEM) against Currie. A potential role for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in CTMC-mediated cytotoxicity also was investigated. Polyclonal antibodies to TNF-alpha greatly reduced CTMC and TNF-mediated lysis of WEHI-164, but only partially inhibited CTMC killing of the slightly TNF-sensitive 5C25 tumors, and had no effect on CTMC cytolysis of Currie. Thus, this study demonstrates that CTMC mediate cytotoxicity in vitro by both TNF-associated and TNF-independent mechanisms. We conclude that CTMC are capable of mediating antitumor activity and that this effect may be important for tumor surveillance in the skin and other sites.\r"

  ".W": "To develop methods for the investigation of mRNA transcription in rare epidermal cells, we used in situ transcription to study CD1a mRNA in isolated CD1a positive cells. We chose to study this Langerhans cell marker because it is not known which epidermal cells actually produce the CD1a protein and because there is evidence that CD1a mRNA is alternately spliced, a situation which could lead to truncated or alternate protein products in CD1a surface protein negative cells. Disaggregated epidermal cells were resolved into CD1a surface protein positive and negative groups by fluorescence activated cell sorting and cytocentrifuged onto glass slides. A synthetic 52 base, CD1a specific anti-sense oligomer was hybridized to CD1a gene transcripts in these cells, and radiolabeled cDNA synthesized in situ on the oligomerprimed CD1a transcripts. The labeled cDNA fragments were visualized in the cells of origin by autoradiography, and grains per cell were counted. Sixty-eight percent of cells expressing CD1a protein contained CD1a mRNA, as evidenced by grain counts more than two standard deviations above the mean value for similar cells carried through the same procedure with a control oligomer, or the mean value of CD1a surface protein negative cells treated with the CD1a specific oligomer. Thus, it seems likely that the CD1a protein positive epidermal cells use CD1a mRNA to make their own CD1a protein, and that a truncated or masked CD1a protein is not made by CD1a negative neonatal foreskin epidermal cells. In our hands, in situ transcription is simpler and faster than standard methods of in situ hybridization with prelabeled cDNA or RNA probes. Furthermore, it can be applied to the detection of any message of known sequence. The combination of cell sorting and in situ transcription can be used to localize and quantify the expression of specific mRNA by individual cells, allowing the study of rare and difficult-to-obtain cells.\r"

  ".W": "Low cell calcium level is essential for preservation of red blood cell (RBC) membrane deformability and survival. RBCs from patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) demonstrate reduction in membrane deformability, possibly as a result of increased RBC cellular calcium level. To evaluate calcium homeostasis in RBCs from patients with ESRD, we measured cell calcium level, basal and \"calmodulin\"-stimulated calcium-stimulated Mg-dependent ATPase (CaATPase) activity, and calcium 45 efflux were measured before and after hemodialysis. The in vitro effect of uremic plasma and of urea on CaATPase activity of normal RBCs was tested, and 45Ca influx into RBCs of patients undergoing hemodialysis also was determined. A morphologic evaluation of red cells from patients with ESRD was performed with a scanning electron microscope. RBC calcium level in patients (mean +/- SEM 21.2 +/- 2.8 mumol/L of cells; n = 28) was higher than in controls (4.9 +/- 0.3 mumol/L of cells; n = 24; p less than 0.001). Hemodialysis had no effect on cell calcium level. Both basal and \"calmodulin\"-stimulated RBC CaATPase activities in patients with ESRD (n = 9) were reduced by approximately 50% (p less than 0.01), but after hemodialysis, enzyme activity returned to normal. 45Ca efflux from calcium-loaded cells, which was 2574.0 +/- 217.0 mumol/L of cells per 0.5 hours before hemodialysis, increased to 3140.7 +/- 206.8 mumol/L of cells per 0.5 hours after hemodialysis (p less than 0.005). In vitro incubation of normal RBCs with uremic plasma depressed CaATPase activity, but incubation with urea had no effect. RBCs of patients with ESRD revealed increased 45Ca influx, 7.63 +/- 1.15 mumol/L of cells per hour versus 4.61 +/- 0.39 mumol/L of cells per hour (p less than 0.025). RBCs of patients revealed a high incidence of spherocytosis and echynocytosis, which correlated with a high cell calcium level (r = 0.894, p less than 0.01). These results indicate that RBC calcium level is elevated in patients with ESRD and suggest that a dialyzable uremic factor inhibits RBC CaATPase activity and thereby calcium efflux, which may account for the elevated cell calcium level. The increased calcium influx further increases cellular calcium level. These abnormalities are associated with spherocytosis and echynocytosis and may contribute to the shortened survival of RBCs in uremia.\r"

  ".W": "Earlier studies have revealed hypomagnesemia with cyclosporine treatment in renal and bone marrow transplant recipients. The present study was designed to investigate the possible effect of cyclosporine on Mg metabolism in normal rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into the cyclosporine group, which was given 15 mg/kg/day cyclosporine by gastric gavage, and the control group, which received the vehicle alone. Food intake, body weight, serum concentration, urinary excretion, fecal excretion, and tissue content of Mg were determined weekly for 3 weeks. In addition, intestinal absorption of Mg was determined by using in vivo perfusion. Serum Mg concentration fell significantly after 1 week of cyclosporine treatment and remained low throughout the observation period. This was associated with reduced food intake and renal Mg conservation during the first week but normal food intake and severe renal Mg wasting thereafter. In vivo perfusion studies performed at 1 and 3 weeks showed no significant difference in intestinal absorption of Mg between the two groups, thereby excluding intestinal malabsorption as a possible culprit. Likewise, fecal Mg excretion showed no significant difference in the two groups. It was surprising that tissue Mg content (in muscle, liver, and kidney) was increased in the cyclosporine-treated group at 3 weeks. We conclude that cyclosporine administration in rats leads to a fall in serum Mg concentration primarily as a result of renal Mg wasting and possibly as a result of a shift of Mg to the tissue compartments with no discernible effect on gastrointestinal handling of Mg.\r"

Aluminum compounds of varying degrees of solubility were studied. At pH 3, more than 25% of the aluminum from all of the compounds studied (with the exception of sucralfate [13%]) was in solution. At pH 6, the solubility of aluminum in Al(OH)3 and sucralfate was less than 1%; it was 15% in AlCl3 and 33% in aluminum lactate. Aluminum solubility did not change with a change in pH for the citrate compounds, which varied between 38%, with sucralfate plus citric acid, and 91%, with aluminum citrate. The fraction of the administered dose of aluminum absorbed as estimated by urinary excretion after gastric gavage was 0.015% for sucralfate and Al(OH)3, 0.037% for AlCl3 and aluminum lactate, and greater than 0.80% for all aluminum compounds administered with citrate. A similar relationship was found between the solubility of the aluminum compounds and absorption, as determined by calculated absorption from the changes in plasma aluminum levels. Solubility alone, however, could not totally explain the effect of citrate on aluminum absorption. The solubility of aluminum in aluminum lactate and sucralfate plus citric acid were the same at pH 6. Absorption of aluminum from aluminum lactate, however, was only 1.6% as much as that found for sucralfate plus citric acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Increased generation of free radicals and accelerated lipid peroxidation are important manifestations of iron toxicity. We have studied the effect of iron loading on lipid peroxidation in cultured rat myocardial cells by direct measurement of the fatty acid composition of cellular lipids. Iron loading produced by 24-hour incubation of cultured cells with 0.36 mmol/L ferric ammonium citrate resulted in a moderate reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as 22:5 and 22:6. A more drastic reduction in PUFAs and an apparent reciprocal increase in the proportion of saturated fatty acids were both obtained after 24 hours of incubation of liposomal vesicles prepared from whole cell lipid extracts with iron at between pH 4.5 and pH 5.5. Reduction of 22:5 and 22:6 was first noticed at 3 hours, and undetectable levels were reached by 12 and 24 hours of incubation. Ascorbate had a biphasic effect on liposomal PUFA levels: at low concentrations (0.057 mmol/L) it enhanced the iron-induced changes in liposomal fatty acid composition, but at higher concentrations (0.57 and 5.7 mmol/L), it inhibited these changes. Unlike ascorbate, alpha-tocopherol (0.023 to 2.3 mmol/L) inhibited the iron-induced reduction in PUFAs in a dose-dependent manner, with complete inhibition of the iron effect at 2.3 mmol/L. These observations underline the particular sensitivity of PUFAs to iron-induced lipid peroxidation. They also illustrate the ability of ascorbate and alpha-tocopherol to modify iron-induced lipid peroxidation. Further studies are required to explore the possible therapeutic implications of these observations in clinical iron overload.\r"

To further determine their value as a model system, we investigated the pathways of ammoniagenesis under both normal conditions and acid-base manipulations. Pulse-chase studies with carbon 14-labeled glutamine demonstrated a marked delay in glutamine conversion to glutamate, indicating that glutamine deamidation is a critical rate-limiting step, and also provided evidence for metabolism of the glutamine carbon skeleton by the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Ammonia and alanine were the predominant nitrogen metabolites of glutamine at all pH conditions, and the stoichiometry suggested that glutamate is metabolized through both glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate transaminase at pH 7.4. Increased ammonia production in response to a low pH was associated with increased flux through phosphate-dependent glutaminase and the glutamate transamination pathway and was accompanied by a fall in intracellular glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate concentrations, which was similar to events in the intact kidney. Studies with the inhibitors acivicin and amino oxyacetate suggested that the gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and glutamine transamination pathways are inconsequential in LLC-PK1 cells. The phosphate-dependent glutaminase pathway appears to play a predominant role in the regulation of ammoniagenesis. The similarity in ammonia metabolism with other in vitro and in vivo models suggests that LLC-PK1 cells will be a useful system for investigating renal ammoniagenesis and the intracellular signals that modulate this process.\r"

Blood samples were obtained from patients with chronic renal failure who were undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, from patients with chronic renal failure who were not undergoing hemodialysis, and from age-matched normal subjects. With the three radioimmunoassay kits tested, the direct assays without extraction in normal subjects gave PAC values comparable to those obtained after the dichloromethane extraction; in contrast, in patients with chronic renal failure, the direct plasma radioimmunoassays yielded consistently higher values than those obtained after the extraction (p less than 0.001). When various plasma steroid metabolite fractions were separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a reverse-phase column, and each fraction was assayed for PAC with the three radioimmunoassay kits, high immunoreactivities were found in the polar fractions in the plasma from patients with chronic renal failure but not in normal plasma. The ratios of the immunoreactivities of these polar fractions to that of the aldosterone fraction, determined after HPLC separation, showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.746, p less than 0.001) with serum creatinine concentrations in plasma from patients with chronic renal failure who were not undergoing hemodialysis. These results indicate that the values for PAC are falsely elevated in chronic renal failure when PAC is measured by radioimmunoassay kits without prior extraction. Furthermore, plasma from patients with chronic renal failure contains a polar substance(s) that cross-reacts with antialdosterone antibodies. This so far-unidentified substance increases with advancing renal impairment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Serum vitamin D3 was determined 1 hour before (basal value) and 24 hours after a single whole body exposure to UVB in a phototherapy unit. The basal vitamin D3 concentration was similar in all individuals (mean +/- SEM for whole group, 1.6 +/- 0.2 ng/ml). UVB irradiances were followed by proportional rises in serum vitamin D3 (at 27 mJ/cm2, 14.3 +/- 3.7 ng/ml), and the overall correlation between UVB radiation and consequent serum vitamin D3 response (r = 0.81; p less than 0.02) was best described by an exponential function. The minimal UVB radiation level that produced a significant increase in serum vitamin D3 was 18 mJ/cm2, a value similar to the lowest solar broadband UVB irradiance that generates previtamin D3 in vitro from the precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol (20 mJ/cm2). Because in the northern United States winter UVB irradiance does not generally reach this threshold level, we conclude that individuals living at extreme northern (or southern) latitudes may have higher dependence on body stores and dietary supply to meet their vitamin D requirements during winter.\r"

We studied the effect of the coagulation of whole blood on the induction of neutrophil complement receptor (CR) expression in vitro. Neutrophils incubated in serum for 1 hour at 37 degrees C increased the expression of CR1 3.43-fold and CR3 3.06-fold compared with incubation in buffer (p less than 0.001). In contrast, incubation in plasma did not induce such an increase. The serum factor responsible for this CR-inducing effect appeared to be a platelet constituent, because (1) serum derived from platelet-rich plasma, but not platelet-poor plasma, contained the CR-inducing factor; (2) pretreatment with aspirin inhibited the adenosine diphosphate-induced expression of this factor in platelet-rich plasma; (3) the CR-inducing factor was also contained in supernatants derived from frozen/thawed platelets; (4) pure platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induced CR expression to the same extent as did whole serum; and (5) the CR-inducing activity of serum and platelet supernatants was inhibited by incubation with antibody against PDGF but not by antibody against C5. Thus, a platelet component that is probably PDGF appears to be the major CR-inducing factor generated during in vitro coagulation and may play a vital role in mediating the neutrophil response to tissue injury and inflammation.\r"

All were interviewed and assessed by means of a questionnaire seven to 51 months post-operatively. Sixty-eight per cent of the children reported a sustained improvement in their nasal airway. There were no significant post-operative complications in this series. In particular there were no cases of serious post-operative haemorrhage, excessive dryness or crusting of the nose. It is concluded that surgical reduction of the inferior turbinate is a safe and effective option in the treatment of children with severe nasal obstruction.\r"

Irradiation was effective as primary treatment and after failed surgery and/or drug treatment. Low doses were effective and there were no significant acute or long-term side effects. Its use avoids long-term medication and their potential side effects and may reduce the need for surgery.\r"

They arise during early embryogenesis and are invariably benign. Unlike the more differentiated types of teratoma, hairy polyps are derived from only two germinal layers, ectoderm and mesoderm. Most originate in the oro-nasopharyngeal region, either as pedunculated or sessile masses. They usually present at, or soon after, birth with signs of upper aerodigestive tract obstruction. Treatment consists of surgical removal. In young children with airway compromise, the expertise of an experienced paediatric anaesthetist is essential. Three new cases of hairy polyp are described to add to the present literature. Two originated in the nasopharynx and one in the oropharynx. Interestingly, one patient, a neonate, also suffered from severe osteopetrosis. All lesions were removed by simple surgical excision under general anaesthesia. There were no operative or post-operative complications.\r"

Stenosis, due to dense fibrous connective tissue, was still present at death. However, there was evidence that there had been growth of the laryngeal cartilages. Disruption of the laryngeal cartilages was present anteriorly due to the antecedent surgery but major cricoid cartilage injury secondary to intubation was not seen. The crico-arytenoid joints demonstrated ankylosis and to this was attributed the abnormal quality of voice noted in the child at follow-up.

The abnormalities of phenotype and karyotype are now eponymously associated with his name. Very many phenotype stigmata have now been recognized to be associated with Turner's syndrome. However, a survey of females with the syndrome revealed that they consider that a major disability associated with the abnormal karyotype results from otological disease and that this is poorly recognized as a significant feature of the syndrome. The incidence of otological disease in patients with this syndrome has been difficult to evaluate because of ascertainment bias and the apparent diversity of otological disorders previously reported. This report reviews the literature and details a study of otological disease and hearing impairment in a sample of Turner's syndrome females enrolled from a defined area.\r"

Twenty-four per cent of non-users believed that antroscopy would not alter their management of patients, and 19 per cent of all responders thought that antroscopy had no proven clinical role. Few surgeons recognized a role for antroscopy in the treatment of antral disease. Antroscopists preferred to operate on in-patients (73 per cent), under a general anaesthetic (60 per cent) and via the inferior meatus (66 per cent); 76 per cent consider that morbidity is insignificant.

The annual contribution of BZDs to the total number of drug overdose cases admitted to an intensive care unit displayed an increasing trend over the period, and during the last years BZDs were involved in nearly one-third of all cases. Among the 702 cases of BZD overdosage, 144 had ingested BZD alone, 200 had poisoned themselves with BZD combined with alcohol and 358 had taken BZD with other miscellaneous drugs. In 56% of all the cases the patients had severe central nervous system depression on admission. In 47% orotracheal intubation was performed and in 18% artificial ventilation was administered. Complications were recorded in 69 of the 702 cases (9.8%) and five cases were fatal. These clinical features were essentially the same in the group that had overdosed with just BZD. In conclusion, patients with drug overdosage involving BZD have a low hospital mortality, but the acute somatic risk is not negligible. Moreover, they consume a substantial proportion of the resources in the emergency room and the intensive care unit.\r"

Serum cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol showed a positive and linear association with coffee consumption in men. In women, no such significant linear association was evident, although the highest mean serum cholesterol levels were found in subjects consuming seven to nine cups of coffee daily. Both in men and in women coffee consumption was positively associated with smoking and the intake of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol. Serum cholesterol values, adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, dietary cholesterol, fatty acids, alcohol and physical activity, showed a significant linear association with coffee consumption in men but not in women. Although coffee consumption and high intake of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol were related both in men and in women, adjustment for dietary and other confounding factors did not remove the association between coffee consumption and serum cholesterol concentration in men.\r"

The addition of dimethyl sulphoxide-soluble particles from cigarette smoke to lymphocytes in vitro significantly reduced the capping ability and the PHA-induced (3H)thymidine incorporation. Whereas no significant change in MDTC-dependent capping inhibition was seen in lymphocytes from smokers after 10 d abstinence from smoking. there was a marked decrease in (3H)thymidine incorporation in lymphocytes from smokers after smoking three cigarettes following 10 h abstinence. The tentative conclusion is that exposure to cigarette smoke, or smoke extract, impairs MDTC-dependent capping inhibition and PHA-stimulated lymphocyte transformation by transglutaminase inhibition.\r"

In 132 patients suspected of PAD in the legs we investigated the relationship between the presence of pedal pulse and the distal systolic pressure in order to discover what diagnostic and prognostic information could be found from pulse palpation alone. The prospective study consisted of three consecutive series (A, 51 patients; B, 42 patients; and C, 39 patients); three of the authors palpated the arteries of the patients' feet: one author in each series. The palpatory findings were related to the distal systolic pressures. When pedal pulses were present we found: (a) ankle indices above 50%; and (b) toe systolic pressures above 40 mmHg. These minimal pressure values were reproducible in the three series. Furthermore, patients lacking palpable pulses in both feet had ankle indices below 90%. We conclude: (a) if pulses are palpable on both feet of a patient the prognosis for progression is relatively good regarding the patient's PAD; (b) if pedal pulse is palpable an arteriosclerotic ulcer on the foot will heal; and (c) patients lacking palpable pulses in both feet actually suffer from PAD.\r"
