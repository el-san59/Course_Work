  ".W": "The effects of hydrocortisone (HC) alone and in combination with aminoglutethimide (AG) have been studied on circulating blood levels of androgens in orchiectomised men with metastatic prostatic cancer. Serum testosterone levels were significantly lower in both early and late hydrocortisone-treated patients compared with pre-treatment levels. The regimen of HC + AG increased serum testosterone almost back to pre-treatment levels. Similar observations were noted with serum androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels. Clinical responses to hydrocortisone alone have been observed in this series of patients. It is concluded that aminoglutethimide has no place in the therapy of prostatic cancer and that physiological doses of hydrocortisone represent the best second hormonal manoeuvre for prostatic cancer patients.\r"

Under local anaesthesia we have successfully repaired six of these fistulae using a groin island pedicle flap. The urethra is repaired by mobilising the mucous lining around the fistula and closing it longitudinally, using absorbable 4/0 chromic catgut sutures. The groin island pedicle flap which is based on superficial circumflex iliac vessels is used to cover the repaired lining. The donor defect is closed primarily. In all six cases there was primary healing. This procedure is recommended for cases where the skin around the fistula is badly scarred or where previous attempts at closure have failed. Moderate defects of penile and scrotal skin can also be repaired by this type of flap.\r"

Control of reflux was assessed by 24 h pH recording and endoscopy. It was complete in 67 cases (84.8 per cent) in this non-consecutive series. In the group as a whole LOS pressure increased significantly after FNP, but the intra-abdominal length did not. LOS pressure decreased in 21 cases of whom 16 (76.2 per cent) still had perfect reflux control. Likewise, intra-abdominal length decreased in 41 cases of whom 36 (87.8 per cent) had good reflux control. There was no evidence of a compensatory increase in length to account for reflux control when LOS pressure decreased. When a length-pressure diagram was plotted for the postoperative measurements no clear separation of those with persistent reflux could be seen. These results suggest that the measured changes in LOS pressure and length following FNP are an artefact of surgery rather than the means by which the operation controls gastro-oesophageal reflux.\r"

After investigation, 276 patients were selected and operated upon, as a rule, 4 weeks after radiotherapy (40 Gy/4 weeks). In 224 patients (81 per cent) the oesophagus and cardia were resected and reconstructed with stomach (69 per cent), colon (21 per cent), free ileal graft (7 per cent) or Roux-en-Y-oesophagojejunostomy (3 per cent). The postresectional hospital mortality was 14 per cent in all patients and decreased to 5 per cent in 1983. Mortality was higher when the colon was used for reconstruction than when the stomach was used. By postresection staging, 82 patients were found to have stages I and II tumours and 142 patients stage III tumours. Estimated 3-year survival after resection for all male patients was 28 per cent and for all female patients was 42 per cent. Estimated 3-year survival for all patients treated for adenocarcinoma was 31 per cent. Survival was better for stages I and II patients with adenocarcinoma (52 per cent) than for stage III patients (18 per cent) (P less than 0.01). Estimated 3-year survival for all patients treated for squamous cell carcinoma was 33 per cent. Estimated 3-year survival was better for stages I and II patients with squamous cell carcinoma (48 per cent) than for stage III patients (25 per cent) (P less than 0.001). It can be concluded from this study that resection of oesophagus and cardia after radiotherapy offers hope for cure in a subgroup of patients with non-advanced oesophageal cancer. The operation can be performed with acceptable mortality by experienced surgeons, especially when the stomach is used for reconstruction.\r"

The patients ate smaller meals (1080 +/- 90 kJ versus 1810 +/- 151 for the controls, P less than 0.01), more frequently during the day (eight versus five in the controls). Solid and sour foods were preferred, especially by those with regurgitation, compared with controls. The asymptomatic patients consumed more milk and coffee and less cheese, sour milk, meat, fish, eggs, tea and orange juice than the patients with regurgitation. Vegetable fats and medium chain triglycerides were consumed in negligible amounts. The patients with regurgitation had more fluids separately from meals than the asymptomatic patients. The results suggest that intake of vitamin supplements and replacement of animal fats by vegetable fats may be useful in these patients. Much of the dietary difficulties after colon interposition might be the result of the intra-abdominal colon graft loop anastomosed to the antrum; a short graft with a more proximal anastomosis to the lesser curvature merits study in this context.\r"

Automobile accidents caused the diaphragmatic injuries in 65 per cent of cases while falls from trees were the cause of injury in 10 per cent. Ten patients (50 per cent) were seen within 7 days of the injury and 95 per cent within 3 months. The left hemidiaphragm was ruptured in 85 per cent and the right in 15 per cent of cases. Fifty ribs were fractured in fourteen patients (70 per cent) but there were no pelvic fractures. Fourteen patients (70 per cent) had gastrointestinal visceral herniation into the thorax, the stomach, omentum, colon and spleen being the commonest herniating organs. Successful surgical repair was achieved in 18 patients, 4 of whom also had splenectomy; 2 patients were treated conservatively. A high index of suspicion and early surgical treatment are the mainstay of successful management of traumatic rupture of the diaphragm with or without herniation of abdominal organs.\r"

White cell scans were performed 24 h following injection of autologous 111In-labelled leucocytes and were compared with clinical outcome where abscess was only diagnosed when pus either discharged or was drained at operation. Gamma images detected 28 of the 30 abscesses with no false positives giving 93 per cent sensitivity and 100 per cent specificity. Loculi of pus were identified in 11 of the 36 patients with inflammatory bowel disease with no errors in interpretation. Inflammation was reported in 15 of the remaining 25 patients with known but not necessarily active inflammatory bowel disease. 111In-labelled leucocyte imaging provides a rapid, safe and precise method for detecting intra-abdominal abscess even in the presence of inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

The tests became abnormal in two patients when tested 8 and 53 months after surgery, but both patients are currently well-controlled on ranitidine 150 mg b.d. 22 and 65 months respectively after surgery.

Immediate complications occurred in six (7 per cent) and one patient died (1 per cent). Clearance of the common duct was achieved in 70 (86 per cent). Eight patients required surgery for failed clearance of the duct and suffered no operative mortality. Of 70 patients with cleared ducts, 5 underwent elective cholecystectomy. Four other patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms have required cholecystectomy, also without mortality. Sixty-one patients were reviewed 12-44 months (mean 24; median 22 months) after endoscopic sphincterotomy. Eighteen have died, none from biliary disease. Forty-three patients remain alive and well, free of biliary symptoms since, endoscopic sphincterotomy. When the surgical risk of cholecystectomy and choledocholithotomy is high, endoscopic sphincterotomy is effective and safe. Routine cholecystectomy is not indicated when the common duct has been cleared.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred patients who underwent bypass surgery for unresectable, histologically proven carcinoma of the head of the pancreas were studied to determine: the incidence of a second operation for duodenal obstruction in survivors who had a biliary diversion only; whether the addition of a prophylactic gastroenterostomy is associated with increased mortality. Eighty-six patients (Group A) had a biliary diversion alone while fourteen (Group B) had a biliary diversion and a prophylactic gastroenterostomy. Both groups were comparable regarding sex, age, symptomatology and clinical findings. The postoperative mortality was similar for both groups (Group A, 27.9 per cent; Group B, 14.3 per cent). The mean surgically related hospital stay was 22 +/- 6.5 days (Group A) and 20 +/- 7 days (Group B). Of the 62 patients in Group A who left hospital, 8 (13 per cent) required a second operation for duodenal obstruction (mean interval 5.4 +/- 2.7 months). The in-hospital stay for the second operation was 14.4 +/- 7.7 days. The overall survival for both groups was identical at 6 months (35.5 versus 33.3 per cent) and 12 months (19.3 versus 16.7 per cent). This study suggests that prophylactic gastroenterostomy adds no risk to patients requiring biliary diversion for carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Its routine use is therefore justified since 13 per cent of the patients who survived the biliary diversion required further surgery for duodenal obstruction before death.\r"

One patient had Hodgkin's disease and the remainder were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Treatment was by a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. During follow-up which varied from 4 to 20 years (median 8 years) three patients developed metachronous involvement of the opposite breast and three died from their disease. Prognosis was related to tumour histology and stage of disease. The three who died all had high grade centroblastic lymphoma, the three largest tumours and nodal involvement. Five and ten-year survivals were 85 per cent and 73 per cent respectively, better than the survival of patients for either other non-disseminated extranodal lymphomas or breast cancer.\r"

Of the women invited 50.2 per cent attended for education. A total of 319 breast cancers were diagnosed in the study population during this period. The tumour characteristics, patient prognostic groups and survival have been compared with a control population consisting of the 319 consecutive breast cancers diagnosed immediately before the start of the DHSS trial, in women of the same age group and living in the same health district. There has been a significant reduction in the size at presentation of operable tumours (P less than 0.01) and there has been a small (3.4 per cent) reduction in lymph node involvement, but this is not significant. The rates of presentation of both in situ and advanced carcinoma have not significantly changed following the introduction of a breast self-examination education programme. At this stage no overall survival difference has been identified between the two groups but the median follow up of the study population is limited (25 months).\r"

This finding correlated with the severity, duration and need for treatment. The differences in breast pattern did not persist after the menopause. The question of whether or not cyclical mastalgia can be regarded as a risk factor for breast cancer is uncertain and needs further evaluation.\r"

Fibroblasts were grown in monolayer cell culture from explants of benign and malignant breast tissue and normal skin. MCF7 human breast cancer cells alone (2 X 10(6) cells) or in combination with live fibroblasts (MCF7 + F) were inoculated into the mammary fat pads of 6-8-week-old female nude mice. After 5 weeks tumours were excised, weighed and fixed for histological examination. Addition of live breast fibroblasts significantly increased the retrieval (127/135 versus 52/106, P less than 0.01, chi 2 test) and growth (tumour weight 174 +/- 11 versus 41 +/- 4 mg, mean +/- s.e.m., P less than 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test) of subsequent tumours. Histological examination did not reveal any morphological difference between the two tumour groups. Injection of fibroblasts alone did not produce tumours. Addition of skin fibroblasts was also stimulatory. Glutaraldehyde-killed fibroblasts increased tumour take but did not stimulate tumour growth. Mononuclear blood leucocytes were ineffective. The results demonstrate that, in this model, fibroblasts exert stimulatory influences on human breast cancer xenograft growth and development.\r"

Affected mice have high serum levels of this enzyme and although showing little disability they have widespread and severe muscle disease. Light and electron microscopy, muscle enzyme histochemistry and combined cholinesterase-silver impregnations were used for the study of affected and control animals aged 1 day to 1 year. An early ultrastructural abnormality present already at 1 day was scattered focal streaming of Z-lines. Later there was also segmental muscle fibre necrosis and regeneration. The proportion of muscle fibres showing either necrosis, regeneration or internal nuclei was assessed in several muscles, at ages ranging from 10 days to 1 year. Acute segmental necrosis and regeneration were most marked at 1 to 2 months, although they were present at all ages. The number of fibres with internal nuclei increased progressively until 3 months when 70-80% showed this abnormality. Nerve terminals were unaffected but there was a reduction in the number and depth of postsynaptic folds at motor end-plates in adult animals, confirmed by morphometric analysis. Quantitative study of L4 motor root and tibial nerve showed that fibre numbers, axonal calibres and myelin sheath thickness were normal at all ages. No qualitative abnormalities were found in the CNS or other organs. The findings strongly suggest that the mdx mutant has a primary muscle disease and that the nervous system is normal.\r"

The small rostral and caudal lobes were most severely affected. The mean Purkinje cell density per unit length of foliae showed similar changes. Histological measurements of the area of the molecular, granular and medullary layers of the cerebellar vermis showed that the molecular layer varied in the degree of shrinkage between lobes (from 11 to 39%) while the granular layer showed a consistent shrinkage (9 to 10%). The molecular layer appears to be the most vulnerable region in chronic alcoholics. Brains taken from patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy had particularly low Purkinje cell counts and a large pericerebral space. Nutritional deficiency would seem to be an important factor in the causation of the observed neuropathology, with liver disease playing a lesser role. Evidence that repeated alcohol withdrawal can lead to further brain disturbances is reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "A clinicopathological study was made on 65 patients from a small area of Nagano Prefecture, Japan, with hereditary generalized amyloidosis with polyneuropathy to clarify the clinical variety of the disease. Forty-five patients from Ogawa village showed similar clinical features. The age of onset ranged widely from 16 to 62 years. The main neurological manifestations were polyneuropathy starting in the legs and autonomic dysfunction. Lower cranial nerves were also affected in the advanced stages. Severe cardiac and renal involvement was uncommon. All these clinical features are consistent with type I familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP). The remaining 20 patients from five unrelated kinships showed unique clinical pictures. Two families from Ogawa village had type I FAP, but 4 out of the 5 affected patients showed marked nephropathy with heavy proteinuria from an early stage. Of the three other families, one, with 10 patients, was notable for the involvement of the central nervous system. Most of the patients showed cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal tract signs in addition to a sensorimotor and autonomic peripheral neuropathy. Another family had 2 siblings who had severe amyloid heart disease from the onset and developed polyneuropathy with autonomic features at an advanced stage. In the third family, onset occurred in the sixth decade in all 3 patients and the course was mild in 2, although the clinical features were those of typical type I FAP. Immunohistochemical study revealed that the amyloid fibril proteins in the patients with all four unusual clinical phenotypes were related to plasma prealbumin. The most common form of hereditary generalized amyloidosis in Japan is type I FAP, but the disease shows considerable variety in the age of onset and involves more systemic organs than previously recognized. The newly recognized clinical forms of hereditary generalized amyloidosis with severe amyloid heart disease or central nervous dysfunction indicate clinical heterogeneity of hereditary amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.\r"

Isometric opposition of thumb and fingers to a force of 30 N ('squeeze'), followed by isotonic elbow flexion ('flex') through 15 degrees with the same arm. 'Squeeze' with the left hand followed by 'flex' with the right elbow. Isotonic opposition of thumb and fingers ('cut') through 90 degrees followed by isotonic 'flex' with the same arm. Isotonic elbow 'flex' followed by isometric 'squeeze' with the same arm. All movements were self-paced. Subjects were given instructions to move as rapidly as possible and to start the second movement immediately after the end of the first. Patients were slower than normal when each single movement was performed separately. There was a further decrease in speed when two movements were executed sequentially. This was due to an increase in movement duration of each of the component movements, especially the second, and to an increase in the pause between the first and second movements. In both normals and patients, there was no correlation between the times taken to perform the first and second movements of any of the four sequences that were studied. Because of this we suggest that the two components of the sequence remained under the control of two separate motor programs. When performing the sequential tasks, normal subjects automatically chose an interval between the onsets of the two separate movements of about 230 ms, even in tasks in which the duration of the first movement was less than 200 ms. If normal subjects were instructed to begin the second movement with an interonset interval of less than 200 ms, the speed of the second movement was much slower. Patients with Parkinson's disease automatically chose a much longer interonset interval of 400-500 ms. In addition, they exhibited difficulty in switching from the first to the second movement in the sequence. We suggest that the problems exhibited by patients with Parkinson's disease when they try to perform two rapid sequential movements can be seen as a deficit in the capacity to switch from one motor program to another within an overall motor plan.\r"

The patient had a defect in temporal resolution encompassing auditory, visual and somatosensory modalities, but the clinical defect was limited to the auditory sphere. Auditory comprehension did not improve even if she was spoken to slowly, although marked improvement of temporal resolution was observed as the duration of a nonlinguistic sound was extended. Also, she exhibited a supramodal defect in the perception and reproduction of rhythm, which was rate-dependent. These and other findings led to the following conclusions: the auditory modality is much more dependent on temporal resolution than other sensory modalities; for a full understanding of the mechanism of pure word deafness, not only the defect of temporal resolution but also many other factors, for example, defective discrimination of loudness, pitch or tone duration have to be taken into consideration; and rhythm sense strongly depends on a supramodal capacity of temporal resolution.\r"

After a mean follow up of 3.5 years multiple sclerosis (MS) had developed in 8/14 patients with vascular abnormalities and/or evidence of inflammation and in 5/32 without; the difference is significant (P less than 0.02). The occurrence of perivenular abnormalities in a region free of myelin and oligodendrocytes provides evidence that the vascular changes in MS can occur independently of contiguous demyelination, and may be the primary event in the formation of a new lesion.\r"

Loss of visual contrast sensitivity was found in 6 patients, all of whom had normal visual acuity. Visual loss depended on grating orientation; in all cases the maximum sensitivity loss was for the horizontal. Sensitivity loss was most marked at a temporal frequency of 4 to 8 Hz. Visual fields gave no hint of the orientation selectivity. We conclude that orientation selectivity implicates visual cortical cells in Parkinson's disease. We tentatively suggest that a preferential loss of contrast sensitivity to horizontal gratings might be due to a functional abnormality in the striate cortex that relatively spares the extrastriate cortex. The dependence of visual loss on temporal frequency combined with the sparing of visual acuity might possibly be understood if Parkinson's disease preferentially affects the visual pathway leading from the retina to cortex via the magnocellular layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus. There is an intriguing similarity between the pattern of visual loss in Parkinson's disease and in multiple sclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "The surface electromyographic (EMG) reflex responses of the voluntarily contracting flexor carpi radialis evoked by 'stretch' and by tendon vibration have been compared in patients with spasticity of the upper limb, arising from upper motor neuron lesions, and normal subjects. Reflex responses to 'stretch' comprised increases in EMG activity lasting up to 100 ms which were often divided into 'short' and 'long'-latency peaks. The short-latency responses of spastic patients were increased in size compared with those of normal subjects whereas later activity was commonly reduced or absent. In both groups vibration elicited short-latency, essentially phasic responses with activity falling back to or below the background level within 50 ms despite continuing stimulation. These initial reflex responses were exaggerated in the spastics as compared with the normals. In the relaxed state 'stretch' and vibration either failed to elicit reflex responses in normal subjects or reflexes were of small amplitude; in spastic patients both modes of stimulation regularly evoked well developed responses. These findings with 'stretch' and vibration, both of which forms of stimulation powerfully excite primary endings of muscle spindles, support the view that group Ia afferent-mediated reflex action is enhanced in spasticity. The observation that the normal long-latency responses evoked by stretch, which have been attributed to the action of spindle group II afferents (Matthews, 1984a) additionally excited with this stimulus, are depressed in many spastic patients is consistent with reduced group II effects. Observed abnormalities of stretch reflex behaviour did not readily explain the severity of accompanying spasticity of individual patients.\r"

  ".W": "Short latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to median nerve stimulation were recorded at different times simultaneously and after an order to move the ipsilateral thumb (0, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 780 ms). Brain potentials were derived from surface electrodes over the scalp at contralateral postcentral and precentral sites and muscle potentials were derived from surface electrodes over the thenar eminence. Ipsilateral thumb movement did not affect the early lemniscal P14 or the postcentral cortical N20 but was accompanied by attenuation of the cortical postcentral P27 and cortical precentral P22, N30 and P45. These results suggest that the gating induced by voluntary movement in man occurs at thalamocortical level and that the differential effect on postcentral N20 and precentral P22 may represent the activity of different generators. Gating of SEPs during voluntary movement begins approximately 80-100 ms before EMG onset, is maximal at the time the EMG is maximal, and returns to control values after the EMG is concluded. These results suggest that the gating that precedes the onset of EMG activity is related to premotor events in the cerebral cortex and not to centripetal influences. Gating of SEPs to median nerve stimulation was localized to movements of areas innervated by the median nerve, that is, the ipsilateral thumb, index or middle finger, but not to movements of ipsilateral little finger or contralateral thumb.\r"

  ".U": "87186335\r", 
  ".W": "Contrast sensitivity was measured at nine locations within the central 10 degrees of the visual field in cases of recovered optic neuritis having varying degrees of residual deficit. A sample of 82 patches of visual field was obtained in 14 cases. Circular patches of vertically orientated sinusoidal gratings, 2.5 degrees in diameter, were used. The gratings were modulated in time at 8 Hz and the effect of spatial frequency on the threshold loss determined at each visual field location. As anticipated from what is known of visual field changes in the disorder there was considerable variation in the magnitude of the contrast threshold elevation at different locations in the visual field in any one case. The variability was more marked in cases with greater overall deficit. Three types of spatial loss were encountered. The most common was a loss which increased at higher spatial frequencies, found in 65 of the 82 patches of visual field examined. In 11 the loss was unaffected by spatial frequency and in the remaining 6 the loss was maximal at an intermediate spatial frequency. There was no instance of a loss maximal at low spatial frequencies. Overall the results indicate that sensitivity to higher spatial frequencies is more likely to be impaired following an attack of optic neuritis. In the combined results the effect of spatial frequency on the threshold elevation was statistically significant at all eccentricities (P less than 0.001). Analysis of the combined results revealed no difference in the mean contrast sensitivity loss at eccentricities of zero, 3.75 degrees or 7.5 degrees for intermediate and low spatial frequencies. There is no evidence from these results to suggest that the central foveal projection (papillomacular bundle) is more likely to be affected following an attack of optic neuritis than the projections of other eccentricities within the central 10 degrees as far as mechanisms subserving luminance vision are concerned at these spatial frequencies. Overall there was slightly greater reduction in acuity within the central 5 degrees than at 7.5 degrees eccentricity (P less than 0.05). This may be accounted for by the finding that higher spatial frequencies are more affected, rather than being related to eccentricity per se.\r"

Following remission from their seizures, the rats exhibit very persistent impairments of learning and memory. Learning was impaired on a circular platform task and a spatial reference memory task, and evoked responses from the commissural-CA3 pyramidal cell system were depressed for up to 22 weeks after injection. There was no significant loss of pyramidal neurons because antidromic responses, evoked from other parts of the commissural fibre system, were not affected by the toxin treatment. The depression of these pyramidal neurons provides a reasonable physiological explanation for the learning impairment. These results suggest that impairments of neuronal function can be significant factors in the development of interictal behavioural abnormalities.\r"

Only about 30% of the respondents had taken a computer course, but all indicated a desire to take courses (on average, three of the seven listed in the questionnaire).

Delivery with an intact perineum was more likely among younger women, those with a short second stage of labour and those with a small baby (p less than 0.001).

Two controls matched for age, service, rank and trade were selected for each exposed subject. Mortality among the exposed and control groups was ascertained by means of record linkage with the Canadian Mortality Data Base. Survival analysis with life-table techniques did not reveal any difference in overall mortality between the exposed and control groups. Analysis of cause-specific mortality showed similar mortality patterns in the two groups; there was no elevation in the exposed group in the frequency of death from leukemia or thyroid cancer, the causes of death most often associated with radiation exposure. Analysis of survival by recorded gamma radiation dose also did not show any effect of radiation dose on mortality. The findings are in agreement with the current scientific literature on the risk of death from exposure to low-dose radiation.\r"

Eight (10%) were found to have evidence of severe neurodevelopmental abnormality, and nine (11%) were found to have various minor problems, including seizures, developmental delay and behavioural disorders. There was an inverse association between birth weight and mortality. Neonatal pneumothorax, seizures and clinical evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage were more commonly seen among infants who died; these factors also seemed to be predictive of an adverse long-term outcome.

Of the 5729 patients 5005 (87.4%) were voluntary and 724 (12.6%) involuntary. Involuntary patients were more likely than voluntary patients to be male, single and unemployed and to have been referred by police or transferred from another facility to the mental hospital, where most of the involuntary admissions occurred. They had higher rates of previous admissions to a psychiatric facility and of suicidal and violent behaviour, were more likely to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or mania and were less likely to be suffering from depression or a neurotic disorder. In correspondence with differences in diagnosis, involuntary patients stayed in hospital more than twice as long as voluntary patients, were less likely to receive electroconvulsive therapy, minor tranquillizers and antidepressants, and were more likely to receive neuroleptics and lithium carbonate. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that only the source of referral and a diagnosis of neurotic disorder had an independent effect on admission status. The findings are discussed in the context of the controversy over the parens patriae approach v. the legal approach to involuntary admission of psychiatric patients.\r"

A shallow U-shaped mortality pattern was observed for body mass index and for serum cholesterol level. No statistically significant increases in risk were associated with alcohol consumption. The population attributable risks for smoking, hypertension and diabetes were 39%, 8% and 6% respectively for men and 21%, 12% and 7% respectively for women.\r"

After excluding 65 couples who chose donor insemination and 300 with known female causes of infertility, the cumulative pregnancy rates in the remaining 709 couples were higher with increasing sperm density and motility and seminal volume, but the higher rates were significant only when these variables were combined into total motile sperm count per ejaculate. The cumulative pregnancy rates were 20% with a total motile sperm count of 9 X 10(6) or less, 37% with a count of 10 to 19 X 10(6) and 52% with a count of 20 X 10(6) or more (p = 0.001). Counts higher than 20 X 10(6) were not associated with a further improvement in pregnancy rates, but variability in the results was high, which suggests that the test should be repeated as necessary to determine the true range. Although standards for these and other seminal variables are ill defined, the total motile sperm count incorporates the most useful prognostic information from semen analysis, and the associated pregnancy rates can help guide clinical decisions.\r"

The practices in 1984-85 of mothers in Toronto were determined for comparison with the practices identified in a similar study conducted in Toronto and Montreal in 1977-78 to ascertain if practices had changed in favour of the recommendations. Between July 1984 and February 1985, 404 metropolitan Toronto mothers of infants were interviewed. Compared with the 1977-78 group of mothers, more of the 1984-85 mothers had chosen to breast-feed and fewer had stopped breast-feeding in the first month. As well, fewer of the 1984-85 infants had been fed unmodified cow's milk in the first 6 months of life and introduced to solid foods before 4 months of age. We conclude that major changes in infant feeding practices had occurred since 1977-78 and that the 1984-85 practices corresponded closely to the infant feeding guidelines.\r"

Information was compiled on the proportion of people who had never smoked among victims of lung cancer, the risk of lung cancer for nonsmokers married to smokers and the prevalence of such exposure. On the basis of these data we estimate that 50 to 60 of the deaths from lung cancer in Canada in 1985 among people who had never smoked were caused by spousal smoking; about 90% occurred in women. The total number of deaths from lung cancer attributable to exposure to tobacco smoke from spouses and other sources (mainly the workplace) was derived by applying estimated age- and sex-specific rates of death from lung cancer attributable to such exposure to the population of Canadians who have never smoked; about 330 deaths from lung cancer annually are attributable to such exposure.\r"

The following factors were analyzed: age, sex, stage of disease, serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE), serum ferritin, E-rosette inhibition, urinary catecholamines, and histologic type according to the criteria of Shimada. Estimates of survival were calculated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. The overall survival for 124 patients was 60% at 2 years. There were significant differences in survival by pathology, age, NSE, ferritin, vanilmandelic acid (VMA): homovanillic acid (HVA) ratio, and stage. There was a strong association among NSE, age, stage, and ferritin. Using the recursive partitioning approach, it was possible to subdivide patients into three groups (based on diagnostic values of ferritin, age, and stage) with a good, intermediate, and poor prognosis and estimated 2-year survival of 100%, 62%, and 19%, respectively. Further analysis could not be done because of small numbers in the subgroups, but the results suggest that combinations of age, stage, serum ferritin, and histologic type may be able to define two populations: favorable with 80% + 2-year survival and unfavorable with less than 20%.\r"

  ".W": "The combination of cisplatin (100 mg/m2) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by continuous infusion (1 g/m2/day for 5 days) has been reported to produce a high response rate as neoadjuvant therapy for advanced squamous cell head and neck cancer. We sought to improve the response rate by increasing the dose of 5-FU to 1.5 g/m2/day and 2.0 g/m2/day with allopurinol modulation to reduce toxicity. The overall response rate in the 30 patients who received three courses of chemotherapy was 100% with a 50% complete response (CR) rate. A 50% CR rate was observed in patients with T3 (six of 12) and N3 (four of eight) disease. Six patients (four with CR) did not complete subsequent treatment as planned. Seven of 11 (63.6%) chemotherapy complete responders and three of 12 (25%) partial responders (one lost to follow-up) who received all planned treatment are free of disease. The major toxicity encountered was stomatitis (severe in 32%) followed by leukopenia. The maximum tolerated dose of 5-FU in this combination with allopurinol protection was 1.5 g/m2/day. Cisplatin plus high dose 5-FU does not appear to be associated with a higher CR rate than that reported with conventional doses of 5-FU and is more toxic.\r"

The median survival from the time of the first hepatic infusion was 7.5 months for all patients. In this series, there were two treatment-related deaths, one secondary to the chemotherapy, the other to improper catheter placement. Because of the multiplicity of chemotherapy regimens employed, no definite conclusions can be made concerning the efficacy of intrahepatic infusional therapy for metastatic ovarian carcinoma. It is suggested that its future use be restricted to patients with disease limited to the liver and who are being treated according to a study protocol.\r"

Patients with small lymph node tumors (less than 4 cm) received only six MOPP-courses.

In this group two patients with clinical stage (CS) III disease have relapsed but both are alive after successful salvage treatment. The median follow-up time is 69.7+ months. For the 16 patients with larger tumor masses (greater than 4 cm) the DFS rate is 87.5%. In this group one patient with CS II relapsed and died of Hodgkin's disease, and one with CS III relapsed after 37 months, but is now without evidence of disease, 61 months from diagnosis. The median follow-up time is 62+ months. Most of the children with Hodgkin's disease diagnosed before or during puberty can be cured with chemotherapy alone, and thus will not suffer from the damaging late effects of radiotherapy.\r"

In patients with thyroid carcinoma, we investigated NK activity of peripheral lymphocytes directed against either a standard tumor cell target, K562, or against the clinically relevant target cell, the thyrocyte. Although NK-cell activity was normal when directed against K562 cell targets, NK-cell activity was reduced when labeled thyrocytes were used as target cells. At effector to target cell ratios of 100:1 and 20:1, there was 43 +/- 3% (n = 7) and 29 +/- 3% (n = 7) lyses of thyrocytes using normal lymphocytes, and 17 +/- 4% (n = 5) and 13 +/- 2% (n = 3) using lymphocytes from patients with thyroid carcinoma. These findings suggest that NK-cells have distinct subpopulations and that immune surveillance against specific thyrocyte target cells may be important in thyroid cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Sclerosing papillary duct hyperplasia occurs in various locations in the breast. In the nipple, the process produces a distinct clinicopathological entity referred to as nipple adenoma or florid papillomatosis (FP). Peripheral lesions have been termed radial scar and nonencapsulated sclerosing lesions. This report describes 12 women who presented with sclerosing papillary duct hyperplasia in the subareolar portion of the breast. The term subareolar sclerosing duct hyperplasia (SSDH) is proposed for this condition. The average age of the patients was 46 years (26-73 years). None of the lesions, which averaged 1.2 cm (0.6 to 2.0 cm), involved the nipple. All were beneath the nipple and/or areola or in the breast close to the areola. Three women had bloody nipple discharge but none had nipple erosion or other signs suggestive of Paget's disease. Five patients were well 9 months to 3 years, 9 months (average, 2 years, 7 months) after excisional biopsy. Two other patients had persistent SSDH reexcised 2 years, 6 months and 2 years, 10 months, respectively, after diagnosis. Both were well 1 year later. There is no follow up in two patients treated by excision. Three women are well after treatment by mastectomy. In one of those patients, intraductal carcinoma was found arising in SSDH. The clinical presentation of SSDH differs sufficiently from other proliferative duct lesions to warrant considering it a distinct disease process. It does not appear to be associated with a particular proclivity to evolve into carcinoma and short-term follow-up suggests that excisional biopsy is probably adequate therapy.\r"

The present study extended this work to an analysis of serum keratan sulfate in chondrosarcoma patients. Keratan sulfate levels of 24 adult patients bearing cartilage tumors were observed to be higher than that for age- and sex-matched controls. In nine of ten patients, keratan sulfate level exhibited a significant decrease following removal of the tumor. Analysis of five general hospital patients before and after surgery did not detect such a change. The data were suggestive of an inverse relationship between tumor histopathologic grade and presurgical serum keratan sulfate concentration. Finally, despite the wide range of serum values within each histopathologic tumor group, sequential serum keratan sulfate measurements may be useful in monitoring patients for secondary growth of chondrosarcoma tumors after primary excision.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with known cancer, especially in cases of genitourinary cancer, thickening of the ureteral wall secondary to irradiation, chemotherapy, or surgery may make the diagnosis of metastasis, recurrence or persistence of malignancy very difficult. Since it is impossible to determine by radiologic imaging methods, whether the stricture is benign or malignant in nature, exploratory laparotomy with direct tissue biopsy remains the only procedure for an accurate diagnosis of the cause of the obstruction. As such surgery carries a significant level of morbidity, nonaggressive diagnostic techniques should be considered. The authors investigated the usefulness of aspiration biopsy cytology under fluoroscopic guidance in establishing the true nature of ureteral stenosis in 15 patients with known primary malignancy, who had previously been treated with surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. The etiology of the primary malignancies were uterine cervix (six), bladder (two), prostate (two), uterine corpus (two), pancreas (one), stomach (one), and rectum (one). Thirteen patients had metastatic ureteral involvement. There were no false-positive or false negative cytologic findings, therefore diagnostic accuracy was 100%. In the authors' experience the success of aspiration biopsy cytology depends on the skill and experience of the physician performing the procedure. The results of this study and review of the literature demonstrate that aspiration biopsy cytology is an accurate, minimally invasive means for correct cytologic diagnosis of ureteral strictures which can complicate cancer, without resorting to more aggressive diagnostic procedures.\r"

Thus, differences in nationality were not related to the prognosis. The incidences of high ploidy group in those with an advanced esophageal carcinoma were high and were associated with a poor prognosis in both races.

Approximately 100 small polyps were disseminated throughout the gastric fundus exclusively, leading to total gastrectomy. Metastatic carcinoid in a lymph node and pancreatic gastrinomas also were found at surgery. Gastric endocrine cell proliferation varied from simple argyrophil cell hyperplasia to carcinoid tumors eroding the surface and infiltrating the submucosa. Ultrastructural studies showed that the tumoral proliferation was heterogeneous, and included tumors composed of enterochromaffin (EC) and typical enterochromaffin-like (EC-L) cells, and tumors in which a majority of cells exhibited dense round granules resembling those of A-like or D1/P endocrine cell types. The risk of developing gastric fundic carcinoid tumors in ZES patients submitted to long-term antisecretory treatment should be given increased attention.\r"

There were ten female and six male patients.

The children had no evidence of infection by clinical or laboratory evaluations. All patients were receiving triple antibiotics when naproxen was started. Fourteen patients responded to naproxen with complete lysis of fever within 6 hours of initiation of treatment. Two patients did not respond to naproxen, but proved to have culture-positive infections. There were no side effects from the drug. Naproxen is an effective antipyretic in patients with cancer. It may be useful as a means of differentiating fever secondary to active malignant disease from that due to infection.\r"

To investigate whether this treatment also prolongs survival, a retrospective case-control study was performed. Ten patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, diagnosed between 1983 and 1985, were treated with the neodymium: yttrium aluminum garnet laser (Cooper Lasersonics, Model 8000, Santa Clara, CA). Twenty patients with the same diagnosis observed between 1979 and 1984 served as age-matched controls. There was no significant difference in sex, race, location of the cancer, prior treatment, or dysphagia scores for the two groups. Laser therapy produced a significant improvement in the mean dysphagia score. Life table analysis demonstrated a median survival of 17.5 months for the patients treated with endoscopic laser therapy compared with 5.7 months for the control subjects (P less than 0.05). One-year survival after laser treatment was 75%, compared with 20% in the control group (P less than 0.05).

In contrast to higher success rates in prior reports, 13 procedures (40.6%) failed as repeated pleural drainage was required. Only five procedures (15.6%) achieved complete resolution of pleural fluid. In 14 procedures (43.8%) pleural effusions recurred but were not treated. In some of these cases the effusion may have been reduced sufficiently to relieve symptoms, while in others the high short-term mortality rate (29% in 30 days) and the development of loculated effusions (34%) may have led to the decision not to treat. Instillation of a larger dose of tetracycline (greater than or equal to 1 g) was associated with a better outcome. Although adequate pleural drainage and proper technique were used, other factors such as the presence of pleural masses, atelectasis, loculations, and patient performance status were not uniformly controlled. Greater attention to these factors and use of a larger dose of tetracycline (greater than or equal to 1 g) may increase the likelihood of a successful pleural symphysis.\r"

Granulocytopenia was the dose limiting toxicity for MCF, but cumulative thrombocytopenia was noted. Nausea and vomiting occurred in most patients but was mild. Severe alopecia occurred in half the patients. One patient developed congestive heart failure after receiving a cumulative dose of 206 mg/m2 of mitoxantrone. The incidence of infectious complications was 35% on each regimen; 50% of these were mild. MCF is an effective combination that was well tolerated. Objective responses, durations of response, and survival were similar, but not superior, to standard doxorubicin-based combinations. Toxicity was somewhat less.\r"

In the 20 dogs (eight were chemotherapy resistant) treated with PEG-asparaginase alone, seven had a complete response (CR), seven had a partial response (PR), five had no response (NR), and one was not evaluable (NE). The duration of response (CR + PR) ranged from 14 to 102 days (median, 48 days). In the eight chemotherapy-resistant dogs (seven were previously resistant to L-asparaginase) four had responses (one CR and three PR). In the 17 dogs treated with combined PEG-asparaginase and chemotherapy, 13 had a CR, two had a PR, and two had NR. None of the dogs had had prior chemotherapy, and the duration of response (CR + PR) ranged from 7 to 840+ days, with a median of 126+ days. Four dogs are still on maintenance PEG-asparaginase at 16+, 21+, 26+, and 28+ months. Toxicity consisted of death due to massive tumor breakdown (two dogs), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC--one dog), hypersensitivity reaction (one dog), vomiting (three dogs) and soft stools (three dogs). Four normal dogs were given very high doses of PEG-asparaginase (200 IU/kg and 1200 IU/kg) once weekly for two treatments without any significant toxicity. These results indicate that PEG-asparaginase has antitumor activity in dog with spontaneously occurring malignant lymphoma.\r"

Twenty patients received PCI and 58 did not. There were no significant differences between these groups with respect to age, sex, stage, or median survival (17.4 months with PCI versus 16.9 months without PCI; P = 0.6). One (5%) of 20 patients receiving PCI developed CNS metastases, compared with 14 (24%) of 58 patients not receiving PCI (P = 0.06). The time from diagnosis to development of CNS metastases and survival after CNS involvement was 51 weeks and 14 weeks, respectively, for the patient who received PCI; and a median time of 50 weeks and 26 weeks, respectively, for the patients not receiving PCI. In nine (64%) of the 14 non-PCI patients the CNS was the first and only site of relapse. A Cox regression analysis demonstrated that nodal involvement was significantly associated with an increased risk of CNS metastases. These data suggest that PCI may decrease the incidence of CNS metastases, and that it may be beneficial in the management of patients with N1 or N2 disease.\r"

The recurrence rate for patients with primary disease was 3.6 in 100 months for the OK-432 group and 9.1 in 100 months for the control group (P less than 0.05). In the control group, multiple, large, sessile, and high-grade tumors had high recurrence rates. But in the OK-432 group, overall recurrence rates were low in both high-risk and low-risk patients. Supplementary immunotherapy is especially effective and is recommended in high-risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "Medullary carcinoma of the breast, which is usually associated with a dense lymphocytic infiltrate, carries a better prognosis than do most other histologic subtypes of breast carcinoma. We studied cryostat-cut fresh frozen sections from 12 patients with medullary carcinoma and, as controls, nine patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma in order to determine and compare the antigenic phenotype of the lymphocytic components of these tumors. We used a large panel of monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera for T-cells (Leu-1, Leu-2a, Leu-3a, Leu-9, T-3, T-6, T-10, T-11, and TQ-1), pre-B and B-cells (BA-1, B-1, B-2, B-4, and J5), NK cells (Leu-7 and Leu-11b), and cell activation associated antigens (T-9, HLA-Dr, and Tac). The most commonly encountered antigens on the lymphocytic components of both medullary carcinoma and infiltrating ductal carcinoma were: T-3, T-11, Leu-1, Leu-2a, Leu-3a, and Leu-9. There was little staining for NK-, pre-B-, or B-cell associated antigens in either type of carcinoma. However, the lymphocytes in the control cases tended to express HLA-Dr and T-10 more often than did the lymphocytes in the cases of medullary breast carcinoma. Our data indicate that: the antigenic phenotypes of the lymphocytic infiltrates of medullary carcinoma and those of infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast are essentially similar; and the lymphocytes in these carcinomas are composed predominantly of peripheral T-lymphocytes. We therefore conclude that the favorable biologic behavior of medullary carcinoma of the breast cannot readily be explained by the immunophenotype of its lymphocytic component.\r"

Although teratocarcinomas were larger tumors the retroperitoneal lymphadenectomies revealed metastases in only 10 of 33 (30%) teratocarcinomas as compared to 19 of 30 (63%) embryonal carcinomas. Even after subtracting the teratoma component and stratifying for size of the embryonal carcinoma component, the teratocarcinomas were still less likely to metastasize than comparably sized pure embryonal carcinomas. Statistical significance was found between the differences in size and the differences in the rates of metastases, before and after stratifying for size of the embryonal carcinoma component of the teratocarcinomas. Further, all embryonal carcinomas metastasized as embryonal carcinoma while only 5 teratocarcinomas metastasized as embryonal carcinoma. This study supports experimental evidence that the embryonal carcinoma cells in teratocarcinomas are not necessarily identical to embryonal carcinoma cells in embryonal carcinomas.\r"

Multivariate analysis showed CEA level greater than or equal to 50 ng/ml to be an adverse prognostic factor (P = 0.02); median survival at this level was shorter than at less than 50 ng/ml (7 and 46 weeks, respectively; P = 0.002). No consistent directional changes of follow-up CEA values were observed in patients with initially normal CEA levels, but normalization of levels occurred in complete responders. We recommend that CEA be measured in this disease at diagnosis as an additional prognostic factor and that patients with abnormal initial CEA levels have follow-up measurements to aid in evaluating response.\r"

The proximal location of intraepithelial neoplasia in relation to the condyloma can be explained by the occurrence of neoplasia just proximal to the condyloma and subsequent expansion of neoplasia towards the cervical canal. This study adds topographic evidence linking cervical condyloma to the development of intraepithelial neoplasia.\r"

Aneuploidy was compared with morphologic criteria as a predictor of recurrence. All 18 controls, five hyperplastic glands, and 39 neoplasms were diploid. Nine neoplasms were aneuploid. Compared with their diploid counterparts, aneuploid neoplasms were more likely to weigh more than 50 g (P less than 0.0001) and to have three or more histologic features of carcinoma (P less than 0.0001). Thirty-six neoplasms were followed clinically for at least 2 years (range 24 to 120 months, mean = 64.6 months) or until local recurrence, metastasis, or death. Five were clinically malignant. Neoplasms which recurred or metastasized were more apt to be aneuploid (P less than 0.005) than those showing no evidence of further disease during the follow-up period. They were also more likely to weigh more than 50 g (P less than 0.005) and to have three or more histologic features of carcinoma (P less than 0.0025). However, neither aneuploidy, large size, nor unfavorable histology result was a consistent feature in every malignant neoplasm. Flow cytometric DNA content analysis appears to be as effective a predictor of clinical outcome as size and histology and may be of particular value when the morphologic features are ambiguous.\r"

Using a new enzymoimmunologic assay based on hyaluronate-hyaluronectin interaction, serum levels of hyaluronate were measured in 16 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, 50 patients with other pleural effusions, and 94 healthy blood donors. The mean serum hyaluronate level in patients with mesothelioma (mean, 750 micrograms/l; range, 29 to 5833 micrograms/l) was significantly higher than in patients with other pleural effusions (mean, 56 micrograms/l; range, 4 to 137 micrograms/l) and than in blood donors (mean, 24 micrograms/l; range, 0 to 94 micrograms/l). Comparison of serum hyaluronate values observed in mesotheliomas with the clinical course of the disease suggests that serum hyaluronate might increase only at an advanced stage of the cancer. Therefore, serum hyaluronate determination has probably no clinical value for early detection of malignant mesothelioma, but might be useful to evaluate the clinical course of this malignancy.\r"

Twenty-eight clinical and biologic variables were assessed using univariate and multivariate semiparametric regression (Cox's) models. Ten variables were isolated by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis found a negative relationship between a survival time longer than 60 days and five of these variables; these variables were in decreasing order: encephalopathy, alcohol consumption, aspartate amino transferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen, and total bilirubin. Prevalence, positive, and negative predictive values of encephalopathy were 20%, 27.5%, and 97% respectively. When three other criteria: ASAT greater than four times the upper limit of the normal (N), blood urea nitrogen greater than N, and total bilirubin greater than 2N were added, their prevalence, positive, and negative predictive values were 72%, 89.7%, and 57.1% respectively. These results suggest that in countries where incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma is low and recruitment of patients difficult, absence of encephalopathy must be the only criterion for selection of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in therapeutic trials; whereas, in countries with a high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma the other criteria may be added.\r"

A statistically significant association between the use of oral contraceptives and extrahepatic bile duct cancer was observed among women under 60 years of age. Patients reported significantly higher frequencies of history of ulcerative colitis or diseases of the gallbladder.\r"

With intact endothelial cells we observed, on elevation of transmural pressure in cannulated isolated arteries, significant membrane depolarization, action potential generation, and reduction in internal diameter. After perfusion of the same vessels with collagenase and elastase for short periods of time to disrupt the endothelial layer, all previous responses to elevation of transmural pressure were no longer seen. Even though enzyme perfusion had no effect on membrane potential at \"control\" levels of transmural pressure, it abolished the pressure-dependent depolarization, action potential generation, and constriction. Furthermore, the contractile response to agonist stimulation was maintained after endothelial disruption via enzymes, showing that this method of endothelial disruption did not appreciably damage muscle cells. The data document a dependence of an intact endothelium in mediating the activation of isolated cat cerebral arteries in response to a changing transmural pressure. Thus, it is possible that the endothelial cell may serve as a transducer in the autoregulatory response to pressure.\r"

  ".W": "Purified sarcolemmal and light vesicle (intracellular) fractions of beta-adrenergic receptors were used to examine the effects of propranolol on receptor translocation in guinea pig heart. Guinea pigs were given propranolol (0.15 mg/kg/hr) via minipumps for 7 days and either killed or made ischemic for 1 hour via a coronary ligature. Propranolol treatment led to an externalization of beta-receptors from light vesicle to sarcolemmal fractions. This externalization increased the number of surface beta-adrenergic receptors that were functional, as assessed by isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. After chronic propranolol treatment, ischemia did not further alter receptor distribution. These results suggest that externalization of beta-adrenergic receptors from a light vesicle fraction to the sarcolemma contributes to up-regulation of beta-receptors that occur in response to both propranolol treatment and ischemia. Because propranolol-treated animals show blunting in externalization after myocardial ischemia, propranolol treatment and myocardial ischemia appear to access the same pool of intracellular beta-adrenergic receptors. Depletion of this pool of receptors along with receptor blockade may thus contribute to the mechanism by which the drug is efficacious in preventing some adverse effects of ischemia.\r"

Endothelial balloon denudation was performed and the animals were fed laboratory chow for 3 months, after which coronary artery spasm was repeatedly provoked by histamine given intracoronarily. Regional hypercontraction of the coronary artery was documented by selective coronary arteriography, and the resulting myocardial ischemia was confirmed by ECG-ST changes. To evaluate coronary artery spasm without the influence of blood constituents and neural control and to quantitate the pharmacophysiological characteristics of histamine-induced coronary constriction in the coronary spasm, the same heart was isolated and perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution under a constant perfusion pressure of 90 mm Hg. Histamine (10(-5) M) reduced the diameter of the coronary artery of the isolated heart by 29 +/- 4 and 67 +/- 3% (p less than 0.001) in nondenuded and denuded areas, respectively. These figures were similar to data obtained angiographically in vivo after the administration of histamine 10 micrograms/kg. The constriction of the denuded areas in response to histamine was topologically the same in vivo and in vitro. The degree of focal constriction induced by histamine, defined as a percent of stenoses from the mean diameter of the areas of proximal and distal to the spastic site, was similar in in vivo (10 micrograms/kg i.c.) and in vitro (10(-5) M) conditions. KCl (40 mM) reduced both the denuded and nondenuded coronary artery diameter by 67 +/- 3% and 68 +/- 3% (NS), respectively. The dose-response relation of the coronary diameter to histamine was not influenced by pretreatment with the nerve transmitter blockers guanethidine (3 X 10(-6) M), atropine (10(-6) M), and tetrodotoxin (3 X 10(-7) M). Phenylephrine (10(-5) M) did not potentiate constriction of the denuded areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Right coronary autoregulation was assessed in 14 open-chest, anesthetized dogs. In Group 1 (n = 5), the left common and right coronary arteries were cannulated and perfused independently. As coronary perfusion pressures varied simultaneously between 70 and 120 mm Hg, right coronary blood flow changed by 48%, whereas left coronary flow changed by 13%. In this pressure range, the autoregulatory closed-loop gain of the right coronary circulation averaged 0.37 +/- 0.01, reflecting a modest autoregulatory capability but significantly less than that of the left coronary circulation, 0.78 +/- 0.08. In Group 2 (n = 9), only the right coronary artery was perfused, and right coronary venous blood was collected for determining arteriovenous oxygen extraction. Autoregulatory gain was similar to that of Group 1, indicating that collateral flow associated with intercoronary pressure gradients does not mask right coronary autoregulation. Right ventricular myocardial oxygen consumption varied directly with perfusion pressure, ranging from 7.1 +/- 1.0 to 2.9 +/- 0.8 ml O2/min/100 g as pressure was reduced from 160 to 40 mm Hg. Thus, right coronary autoregulation is masked by an opposing change in oxygen demand. When right ventricular oxygen consumption was altered by pacing, a linear flow-oxygen consumption relationship was observed (8.2 +/- 0.4 ml/min/100 g per ml O2/min/100 g). Subtraction of flows associated with pressure-induced changes in metabolism revealed a potential autoregulatory capability of the right coronary circulation similar to that manifested by the left coronary circulation.\r"

Action potentials elicited after short diastolic intervals of less than 2 seconds showed an increase and prolongation of the plateau compared to those elicited after a 10-second rest period. The recovery of the tetrodotoxin-insensitive secondary inward current revealed a transient increase at short diastolic intervals above the level of full recovery (after 10 seconds). The increased secondary inward current recovery, however, was voltage-dependent, and the period of its increase did not cover the entire diastolic intervals of the action potential overshoots, suggesting the contribution of another ionic current to the changes in potential. During depolarizing voltage steps, from + to -20 mV, a rapid activating and then inactivating outward current was elicited, which overlapped the calcium current. This outward current exhibited time- and voltage-dependent properties similar to those of the transient outward current in Purkinje and other cardiac preparations. The recovery of the transient outward current was slow, achieving only 75% of its full level at 2 seconds, whereas the same level of calcium current recovery was achieved at 200 milliseconds. The application of 4-aminopyridine suppressed most of the transient outward current, and the rest of the current was abolished by caffeine or Co2+. The 4-aminopyridine sensitive transient outward current exhibited slow recovery kinetics compared to those of the other or calcium current, and its inhibition caused elimination of the augmented plateau during electrical restitution. The application of verapamil or Co2+ for inhibition of secondary inward current also abolished the action potential overshoot. These results indicate that an increase and prolongation of the plateau at short diastolic intervals are produced by the slower recovery from inactivation in the 4-aminopyridine-sensitive transient outward current than that in the calcium current.\r"

Transmembrane action potential and isometric force were simultaneously recorded in right ventricular papillary muscles from euthyroid, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid rats. Large thyroid state-dependent alterations in the contractile response of the muscles were not accompanied by any significant difference in the action potential. During steady-state stimulation, single test stimuli were interpolated at varying intervals. Action potential duration and peak force of the test responses were plotted against the test stimulus interval to produce electrical and mechanical restitution curves. In all muscles studied, electrical and mechanical restitution followed different time courses; over a wide range of test intervals, action potential duration and peak force of the test responses changed in opposite directions. Thyroid state profoundly affected the recovery of contractile strength, while only minor differences were found among the electrical restitution curves of the three groups of preparations. Mechanical recovery was much faster in hyperthyroid and slower in hypothyroid than in euthyroid muscles. We conclude that electrical and mechanical restitutions occur through separate processes and that the thyroid state affects only the mechanisms responsible for the contractile recovery of rat myocardium. The modifications induced by thyroid dysfunction on contractile recovery might be accounted for by an effect of thyroid state on a time-dependent recycling of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\r"

Cranial neural crest cells populate all of the pharyngeal arches and provide the mesenchymal walls of the aortic arch arteries. Neural crest cells migrate from the pharyngeal apparatus into the outflow region of the heart. However, it is not known which of the pharyngeal arches contribute ectomesenchyme to the developing heart nor has a pattern of distribution in the outflow region been established. In the present study, premigratory presumptive arch neural crest from quail embryos was grafted homotopically onto early chick embryos. On Day 6 of incubation, the chimeric embryos were fixed and processed for histological evaluation. The neural crest providing mesenchyme to pharyngeal arches 1 and 2 was not associated with the developing heart. Neural crest presumptive for arches 3, 4, and 6 was found distributed to the outflow region of the heart. Neural crest from arch 4 contributed the largest number of cells to the developing aorticopulmonary and conotruncal septa. This information indicates that ablations of neural crest presumptive for arches 3, 4, and 6 influence heart development directly while lesions of other areas of cranial neural crest probably influence heart development only secondarily with the primary effects occurring in the pharyngeal arches.\r"

Force generated in rings of rabbit thoracic aorta by norepinephrine (1 microM) was measured under isometric conditions. At the appropriate time during 1 microM acetylcholine-induced relaxation of 1 microM norepinephrine-contracted rabbit thoracic aorta, the rings were pulse-labelled with calcium-45 to measure calcium influx. When measured in this fashion, 1 microM acetylcholine decreased the 1 microM norepinephrine-induced increase in calcium influx. This effect was eliminated by removal of the endothelium and by atropine (1 microM), but not by indomethacin (14 microM). Acetylcholine (1 microM) also blocked the 60 mM potassium-chloride-induced increase in calcium influx without dramatically affecting force. The phasic contraction produced by norepinephrine (1 microM) with 2 mM lanthanum pretreatment, which is caused by release of intracellular calcium, was inhibited by acetylcholine (1 microM) in a fashion similar to 1 microM nitroglycerin. The tonic contraction produced by norepinephrine (1 microM) after depletion of the agonist-releasable pool of intracellular calcium, which is thought to be due to calcium influx, was depressed by acetylcholine (1 microM). These data suggest that endothelium-derived relaxing factor relaxes 1 microM norepinephrine-contracted rings of rabbit thoracic aorta by decreasing calcium entry and by producing an extracellular calcium-independent relaxant effect.\r"

  ".W": "The actin binding and ATPase kinetics of cardiac myosin subfragment-1 were compared with prior studies on skeletal myosin subfragments. Previous kinetic studies on rabbit skeletal subfragment-1 (S-1) have revealed two important features of the actomyosin ATPase activity. First, hydrolysis of ATP by myosin subfragment-1 proceeds both when S-1 is bound to actin and when it is dissociated from actin. Second, the actin concentration required to reach half the maximum ATPase activity, Ka(ATPase), is considerably lower than the actin concentration required to bind half the subfragment-1 during steady state hydrolysis of ATP, Ka(binding). These kinetic facts require that skeletal myosin hydrolyze ATP without dissociating from actin; therefore, a \"nondissociating\" pathway for ATP hydrolysis exists. The studies reported here show that porcine cardiac S-1 is very similar to rabbit skeletal S-1. Under identical conditions to prior work on skeletal S-1, the Ka(ATPase) of porcine cardiac S-1 is approximately equal to that reported for skeletal S-1. This is also true for Ka(binding). Comparison of Ka(ATPase) and Ka(binding) shows that for cardiac proteins Ka(ATPase) is fourfold to sixfold stronger than Ka(binding), i.e., half maximal ATPase activity is achieved at about one fifth the actin necessary to reach 50% binding. The extrapolated maximum ATPase activity at saturating actin concentration for cardiac S-1 is consistently slower than skeletal S-1 by about a factor of 2.5. Furthermore, studies of the actoS-1 ATPase activity at high actin concentrations as well as with crosslinked actoS-1 show no significant inhibition, implying the requirement of a \"nondissociating\" pathway for ATP hydrolysis by cardiac myosin subfragment-1.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the relation between left ventricular (LV) function and the severity of acute myocardial ischemia in a conscious dog model. The LV ejection fraction (EF) was measured by multigated equilibrium radionuclide angiography, and regional myocardial blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres before and 10 minutes after distal and then proximal occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD, 13 dogs) or left circumflex (LC, 13 dogs) coronary artery. Two methods were used to evaluate the extent of ischemia. The first method determined the mass of myocardium that was ischemic based on different degrees of reduced blood flow. The second method estimated the severity of ischemia expressed as blood flow deficit resulting from each coronary occlusion. Global LV function was very sensitive to ischemia, and the relation between change in function and the degree of ischemia were described best by linear functions. The best linear correlation between mass of ischemic myocardium and percent reduction in EF resulted from the ischemic region defined as all tissue with 25% or greater reduction in blood flow, r = 0.84 for LAD (Y = 0.96X + 1.8) and r = 0.75 for LC (Y = 0.53X + 2.0) occlusions. Defining ischemic mass by more severe reduction in blood flow resulted in exclusion of ischemic myocardium that affected function. The myocardial blood flow deficit also correlated linearly with percent reduction in EF, r = 0.89 for LAD (Y = 1.31X + 2.7) and r = 0.81 for LC (Y = 0.83X - 0.1) occlusions. The slope of the regression lines using both analyses of ischemia were significantly greater (p less than 0.01) for LAD than LC occlusions, indicating that for comparable degrees of ischemia LAD as compared to LC occlusion decreased EF to a greater extent. Calculation of EF from attenuated corrected volumes resulted in small changes in LAD, but not LC, EF and did not account for the disproportionate effects of LAD and LC ischemia. In a separate group of studies (n = 18) EF measured by radionuclide angiography after LAD or LC occlusions correlated well with biplane contrast angiography r = 0.93, SEE 5.1. These data suggest that disproportionately greater effects of LAD compared to LC ischemia on global EF in the dog are due primarily to different pathophysiologic responses to ischemia.\r"

Cyclic 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels were threefold to fourfold higher in unrubbed artery and vein than in vessels that had been denuded of endothelium. Cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels were twofold higher in unrubbed than in endothelium-denuded artery, but no differences were observed in veins. Methylene blue, an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, decreased cGMP but not cAMP levels, and this was accompanied by increases in smooth muscle tone. M&B 22,948, an inhibitor of cGMP-phosphodiesterase, increased cGMP but not cAMP levels, and this was accompanied by decreases in smooth muscle tone. Unrubbed vessels were more sensitive than endothelium-denuded vessels to the actions of both methylene blue and M&B 22,948, and this may be attributed to endothelium-dependent increases in cGMP turnover. Moreover, unrubbed vessels were more sensitive than endothelium-denuded vessels to contractile responses to phenylephrine and potassium, and these responses were potentiated by methylene blue and attenuated by M&B 22,948. Although indomethacin lowered cAMP levels in unrubbed artery, no changes in tone or contractile responsiveness were observed. A consistent observation was that the smaller branches of unrubbed but not endothelium-denuded intrapulmonary artery and vein had higher levels of cGMP but not cAMP, were sensitive to endothelium-dependent vasodilators, were more sensitive to methylene blue, and would not maintain a steady level of submaximal tone to phenylephrine when compared with larger branches from a common vascular bed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hypoxia and rapid stimulation rates had no significant effect on either P or V velocities. All test solutions (except hypoxia alone) significantly increased the PVJ delay. The magnitude of the increase in PVJ delay was much greater than the effects on either P or V velocity. In addition, hypoxia and rapid stimulation augmented the increase in PVJ delay in the presence of elevated [K+] and/or acidosis. The special features of conduction at the PV junctional sites may produce altered pathways of excitation of the ventricles during myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Sodium pump inhibition in cardiac muscle cells is associated with changes in intracellular sodium, calcium, and hydrogen concentrations as well as in membrane ion transport activity. We examined further the functional relations among these entities using cultured chick ventricular cells. [Ca]i and pHi were determined from fluorescence signals obtained from cells loaded with fura-2 or BCECF, respectively. Ouabain (100 microM) elevated [Ca]i eightfold and decreased pHi by 0.11 unit (a 30% increase in [H+]). In the presence of 10 microM ethylisopropylamiloride, a potent inhibitor of Na-H exchange, ouabain elevated [Ca]i 3.5-fold and reduced pHi by 0.16 unit (a 48% increase in [H+]). Exposure to sodium-free (sodium replaced with potassium) medium produced a twelvefold increase in [Ca]i and a 0.12 pH unit decrease in pHi. In cells treated with 100 microM ouabain, exposure to sodium-free (lithium) medium resulted in a 22-fold sustained increase in [Ca]i and a rapid intracellular acidification (pH 7.15 to 6.60). The effect of ouabain or sodium-free medium on pHi was abolished in calcium-free medium; addition of 1 mM Ca rapidly increased [Ca]i and decreased pHi. In cells treated with subtoxic (3 microM) or toxic (100 microM) concentrations of ouabain, initial 24Na uptake rates were significantly greater than in control cells and were significantly reduced in the presence of 10 microM ethylisopropylamiloride. We conclude that ouabain (100 microM) produces intracellular acidification as a result of sodium pump inhibition; calcium accumulation via Na-Ca exchange, and subsequent Ca-H interaction within the cell.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The release of endogenous noradrenaline and its deaminated metabolite dihydroxyphenylglycol in the myocardium have been studied in the isolated perfused heart of the rat subjected to three models of energy depletion: ischemia, anoxia, and cyanide intoxication. Anoxia and cyanide intoxication were combined with substrate deficiency at constant perfusion flow. All three energy-depleting procedures caused a similar overflow of noradrenaline which, following a constant delay of 10 minutes without increased release, amounted to more than 25% of total heart content within 40 minutes. This noradrenaline overflow was not diminished in the absence of extracellular calcium and was inhibited by the uptake1 blocker desipramine in all three experimental models, indicating a common and nonexocytotic release mechanism. In the presence of glucose, neither anoxia nor cyanide intoxication resulted in a measurable noradrenaline overflow. Conversely, blockade of glycolysis or glucose depletion prior to ischemia or cyanide poisoning accelerated the noradrenaline overflow, demonstrating a key role of the sympathetic nerve cells' energy status in causing nonexocytotic catecholamine release. Blockade of energy metabolism in the presence of oxygen (cyanide model) resulted in the overflow of high amounts of dihydroxyphenylglycol that was not inhibited by uptake1 blockade. The release of the lipophilic dihydroxyphenylglycol by diffusion reflects deamination of axoplasmic noradrenaline by monoamine oxidase. Since saturation of the enzyme could be excluded in this model dihydroxyphenylglycol release can be taken as a mirror of cytoplasmic noradrenaline concentration. The results obtained by these studies indicate that nonexocytotic catecholamine release is a two-step process induced by energy deficiency in the sympathetic varicosity. In a first step, noradrenaline is lost from storage vesicles, resulting in increasing axoplasmic concentrations. The second step is the rate-limiting transport of intracellular noradrenaline across the cell membrane by the uptake1 carrier that has reversed its normal net transport direction.\r"

  ".W": "As yet there is no model or simulation that accounts for the anisotropic difference in the shape of the upstroke and safety factor of propagating cardiac action potentials: fast upstrokes occur with slow transverse propagation and slow upstrokes occur with fast longitudinal propagation. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate, however, that a simplified cable model based on directional differences in the effective membrane capacitance predicts in detail the experimentally measured directionally dependent behavior of the upstroke in response to modification of the sodium conductance. Quinidine and lidocaine produced greater relative decreases in Vmax and conduction velocity with longitudinal propagation than with transverse propagation, as predicted on the basis that the shape differences should produce an anisotropic distribution in the membrane uptake of sodium channel binding drugs. The simulation predictions of the effects of positive shifts of the take-off potential due to premature action potentials were also confirmed experimentally: there was a greater relative decrease in conduction velocity, Vmax, and Vamp with a greater increase in tau foot during longitudinal propagation than with transverse propagation. The major anisotropic differences in shape occurred when the take-off potential approached the least negative value that produced a propagated response. The extensive experimental verification of the results of a simplified model based on directional differences of effective membrane capacitance, combined with directional differences in effective axial resistivity, provides an initial quantitative basis for the anisotropic behavior of propagating depolarization in response to modification of the sodium conductance in cardiac muscle.\r"

Measurements of flow and intravascular pressure in the cerebral microvasculature were made via a constantly suffused open cranial window using video microscopy. A significant upward shift was seen in the pressure range for cerebral blood flow autoregulation in both groups of untreated hypertensive animals. Following treatment, the autoregulatory range in both hypertensive models was restored to a level nearly identical to control. The prevention of this shift in treated animals was due primarily to the prevention of structural microvascular adaptations that occur in untreated hypertensive animals. By preventing elevations in microvascular pressure, treatment may have eliminated the major stimulus for development of hypertrophy in resistance vessels. However, a persistent increment of arteriolar wall mass in treated spontaneously hypertensive rats may represent a hyperplastic response not influenced by treatment. Likewise, a persistent constriction of the smallest arterioles in treated renal hypertensive rats may represent a differential sensitivity of microvessels to circulating vasoactive agents. It appears that treatment initiated in the prehypertensive state, or before significant sustained hypertension has occurred, can markedly reduce the cerebrovascular morbidity associated with two different forms of hypertension.\r"

Myosin isoenzymes, Ca2+-myosin ATPase activities, and isometric contractile function were measured in cardiac preparations from thyroxine-treated animals and age-matched controls. Right ventricular hypertrophy did not occur with aging in controls. Thyroxine increased right ventricular weight in each age group compared to the control group. Body weight decreased by 10% in all thyroxine-treated rats. The relative right ventricular V1 isoenzyme content progressively decreased from 75 +/- 1% to 54 +/- 1% and 14 +/- 1% in controls at 2, 8, and 24 months, respectively, and was associated with a reciprocal increase in V3 myosin isoenzyme.

Thyroxine administration increased right ventricular V1 at each age to 97 +/- 2%, 73 +/- 2%, and 59 +/- 2% at 2, 8, and 24 months, respectively.

Ultrathin cryosections of rabbit papillary muscles were analyzed using microprobe analysis, and the concentrations (mmol/kg dry wt) of Na, Mg, I, S, Cl, K, and Ca were compared against low sodium (36 mM) and control (139 mM NaCl) muscle groups. Visual resolution of junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum in freeze-dried myocardial sections was achieved, and systematic analysis of junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum and sarcolemma was performed. Myofibrils and mitochondria were also analyzed. Reductions in Na and Cl concentration were measured in virtually all compartments of muscles bathed in low sodium. In addition, low sodium produced a doubling of junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum and sarcolemmal calcium concentrations (p less than 0.01). No significant changes in calcium were observed at other analyzed sites. The increased calcium at the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum and sarcolemma correlates with (but may not completely account for) the threefold increase in contractility measured after 40 minutes in low sodium concentrations. This work demonstrates that elemental changes associated with the myocardial junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum and sarcolemma are amenable to direct, in situ microprobe analysis and further defines these structures as primary sites of calcium accumulation in low sodium concentrations.\r"

The effect of feeding a standard rabbit diet after an initial period of 2% cholesterol feeding was assessed also. Age-matched male, New Zealand white rabbits were fed either a 2% cholesterol diet or a standard rabbit diet. The animals were anesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium (25 mg/kg) and killed either at the beginning of the study (0 weeks) or at 4, 8, or 10 weeks. The animals in the reversal study were fed the 2% cholesterol diet for 6 weeks and killed after an additional 14 and 32 weeks on standard diet. The extent of atherosclerosis in the aorta was assessed by Sudan Red staining, estimation of tissue cholesterol, and light and electron microscopy. The relaxation response to acetylcholine was measured in rings of the thoracic aorta following precontraction with norepinephrine (-6.0 log mol/l). The relaxation was significantly impaired in aortas from rabbits fed the 2% cholesterol diet compared to aortas from animals fed the standard diet. The impairment of relaxation was apparent as early as 4 weeks after the start of the 2% cholesterol diet and remained impaired over the next 6 weeks. No improvement in endothelium-dependent relaxation was seen in rabbits on the reversal diet for 14 and 32 weeks. Thus, endothelium-dependent relaxation is attenuated in animals fed a 2% cholesterol diet, and the loss of relaxation persists for at least 32 weeks after the animals are returned to a standard diet.\r"

In this study, we have defined the lymph-flow changes that occur in cannulated mesenteric lymphatics following a 25% blood loss in anesthetized sheep and investigated the effects of hemorrhage on the intrinsic contractile activity (lymph pumping) of these vessels in vivo using a new model system. The removal of 25% of the calculated blood volume resulted in increases in lymph flow over a 6-hour period, with peak changes to 3.5 times the prebleed levels. Systemic arterial pressures dropped to roughly 50% of control values immediately following the bleed and returned to control in 3 hours. To directly assess the effects of hemorrhage on lymphatic pumping, a segment of intestinal lymphatic was isolated from all lymph input and supplied with fluid from a reservoir. While there was no net pressure driving fluid through the duct, a transmural distending pressure was applied to the vessel, which stimulated resting lymphatic contractions and fluid pumping. A 25% blood loss resulted in increased activity of the lymph pump; up to 6 times more fluid was propelled through this \"isolated\" vessel in vivo than in similar preparations in sheep that were not bled (p less than 0.01). Measurements of fluid pulse pressures in this preparation indicated increased pumping frequency and/or force after hemorrhage compared with prebleed levels. We conclude that lymphatic contractile activity is stimulated after a blood loss independent of changes in lymph formation and speculate that this mechanism may play an important role in the reexpansion of the vascular space.\r"

This study tested the ability of a lumped RC model with pressure-dependent parameters to predict diastolic capacitance-free flow during maximum vasodilation in anesthetized dogs. Model parameters were characterized by perturbing the circumflex coronary artery with a ramp pressure waveform that caused coronary artery pressure to decline at rates varying from 30-150 mm Hg/sec. Capacitance-free relations constructed from declining and rising ramp pressure-flow data corresponded with capacitance-free pressure-flow points constructed during constant-pressure coronary artery perfusion (which are model-independent). The model parameters derived from analysis of the ramp data indicate that conductance of the coronary bed varies directly with coronary pressure and is independent of the rate of coronary pressure decay. Values of coronary capacitance vary inversely with coronary artery pressure and with the magnitude of dPLC/dt. Thus, a simple, lumped diastolic model with pressure-dependent parameters can predict capacitance-free pressure-flow behavior from dynamic pressure-flow data and characterize model parameters over a wide range of coronary pressure.\r"

Since a close functional coupling exists between myofibrillar creatine kinase and myosin ATPase, a disruption of this coupling could adversely influence myocardial function and might provide a mechanism for the myocardial dysfunction observed. The purpose of the present study was to determine if an alteration in the activity of creatine kinase associated with the myofibril occurs in the postischemic period. Anesthetized open-chest dogs (n = 6) underwent coronary occlusion for 15 minutes, followed by reperfusion for 15 minutes. In reperfused myocardium, adenine nucleotide content was decreased (72 +/- 10% of nonischemic myocardium, p less than 0.05), documenting the presence of previous ischemia. The creatine phosphate content of reperfused myocardium returned to normal, indicating resumption of myocardial energy production. The creatine kinase activity of purified myofibrils isolated from reperfused myocardium was decreased by 17 +/- 7% compared to that of nonischemic myofibrils (p less than 0.03). In addition, the free adenosine diphosphate concentration in reperfused myocardium was calculated to be 96 microM and was less than the Km of adenosine diphosphate determined for myofibrillar creatine kinase (105 microM). The results suggest two putative mechanisms for disruption of energy use in postischemic myocardium: decreased creatine kinase activity associated with the myofibril, and limitation of substrate necessary for maximal creatine kinase activity.\r"

The present study describes the in vivo characterization of synthetic thromboxane A2 on the regional blood flow distribution of the canine heart. Local injections of synthetic thromboxane A2 into the coronary vasculature caused marked reductions in coronary blood flow, measured by both radiolabeled microsphere injection and an electromagnetic flow device. The threshold concentration required to bring about this effect varied greatly between dogs and ranged from 0.125 microgram/kg to 2.0 micrograms/kg. Similarly, the dose of thromboxane A2 required to aggregate dog platelets in vitro varied from 30 ng/ml to 1,000 ng/ml. Bolus injections of 2 micrograms/ml thromboxane A2 into the circumflex or left anterior coronary artery resulted in a simultaneous reduction in platelet count in coronary sinus blood of 83 +/- 5.2% (mean +/- SEM, n = 4, p = .0005). Both flow reduction and platelet effects were transient and localized. The time taken from onset to recovery of the response to control levels was 77 +/- 6.0 seconds (mean +/- SEM) for flow and 70-80 seconds for platelet count. Injections of thromboxane A2 caused a small but significant increase in heart rate with no change in systemic blood pressure. In conclusion, the in vivo actions of synthetic thromboxane A2 are consistent with the vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregatory effects seen in vitro, but dogs vary considerably in their sensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies on the pressor response of the newborn pulmonary circulation to hypoxia have used intact animals and have reported conflicting results. Some have found an increase in responsiveness with increasing age; others have found a decrease. To circumvent many problems inherent in studies of pulmonary vascular reactivity in intact animals, we have developed methods for studying isolated, blood-perfused lungs from newborn rabbits. These methods have been used to study the influence of postnatal age on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Two sets of experiments were performed. In the first, a stimulus response curve for hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction was constructed, using lungs from 19 rabbit pups that were 3-8 days old. At a constant blood flow, pulmonary artery pressure increased progressively as alveolar oxygen tension decreased so that the maximum increase from baseline (29.4 +/- 4.7%) occurred at PIO2 = 0. The pressor response to hypoxia was highly reproducible, and the entire system remained stable for over 2-3 hours. In the second set of experiments, we compared the pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia obtained using lungs from an additional 21 pups that were 3-8 days old with that obtained using lungs from 23 pups that were 10-14 days old. In response to the same hypoxic stimulus, pulmonary artery pressure increased more in lungs from older rabbit pups (56 +/- 4%) than in lungs from younger rabbit pups (34 +/- 7%) (p less than 0.001). We conclude that isolated perfused lungs from newborn rabbits exhibit a reproducible pressor response to alveolar hypoxia and that this response increases as a function of postnatal age.\r"

To ascertain the incidence of strictly defined systemic emboli, we followed 85 patients with echocardiographically documented left ventricular thrombi. At the time of the entry echocardiogram, most patients (n = 57) had remote myocardial infarction, while 19 had recent (less than 1 month) infarction, and nine had idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Because of the difficulty in classifying events as embolic in patients with advanced atherosclerosis, a matched control group of 91 patients without thrombi was also studied. The thrombus and control groups were similar with regard to recent myocardial infarction, remote infarction, anterior infarction, ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, echocardiographic referral for source of emboli, and warfarin therapy. During a mean follow-up of 22 months after echocardiography, embolic events occurred in 13% (11 of 85) of patients with thrombi compared with 2% (two of 91) control patients (p less than .01). The actuarial probability of being embolus free at 2 years after echocardiography was 86% in patients with thrombi compared with 97% in control patients (p less than .01). All embolic events occurred greater than 1 month after myocardial infarction (range 1 to 96 months). The only clinical or echocardiographic features predictive of embolization were protrusion and mobility of thrombus (both p less than .02). We conclude that the incidence of embolic events is definitely increased in patients with left ventricular thrombi compared with control subjects during long-term follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined the role of right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy in defining the underlying process in 54 patients with evidence of constrictive/restrictive physiology, including 38 patients with profound symptoms of heart failure in whom diagnostic/therapeutic thoracotomy was contemplated (group I) and 16 patients with milder symptoms (group II). All patients in group I had NYHA class III or IV heart failure with depressed cardiac index (mean 2.5 liters/min/m2), right atrial hypertension (mean 15 mm Hg), and normal left ventricular ejection fraction (mean 59%). Endomyocardial biopsy identified a specific source of restrictive cardiomyopathy in 15 of 38 patients (39%) (11 amyloid, four myocarditis). Of the 23 remaining patients with either normal biopsy findings or nonspecific abnormalities on biopsy, 18 had intraoperative or autopsy evaluation of their pericardium, and constriction was found in 14 (77%). A specific form of restrictive cardiomyopathy was also identified in four of the 16 patients with milder symptoms (group II). We conclude that endomyocardial biopsy is useful in patients with severe constrictive/restrictive physiology. It identifies a large subset of patients with specific forms of restrictive cardiomyopathy in whom thoracotomy should be avoided. It supports the need for thoracotomy and the likelihood of finding pericardial constriction in patients without specific pathologic findings.\r"

  ".W": "The cardiovascular effects of intravenous verapamil and 3 months of oral administration of a slow-release form of verapamil (verapamil-SR) were studied in 10 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Intravenous verapamil reduced arterial pressure by 15% (p less than .01) through a fall in total peripheral resistance of 29% (p less than .01); provoked a reflexive rise in heart rate (by 19%, p less than .02), cardiac output (by 74%, p less than .01), and plasma catecholamines; and shifted intravascular volume toward the cardiopulmonary circulation indicating peripheral venoconstriction. Quite in contrast to the immediate effects of the intravenous drug, oral therapy with verapamil-SR for 2 to 3 months lowered arterial pressure effectively (by 15%, p less than .01) by inducing vasodilation of 15% (p less than .02), but without causing reflex tachycardia, activation of the sympathetic-adrenergic or renin-angiotensin systems, or volume expansion. Oral therapy with verapamil-SR preserved systemic and renal blood flow and slightly reduced cardiac mass (by 6%, p less than .05) and renal vascular resistance (by 25%, p less than .05). Whereas intravenous verapamil tended to depress myocardial contractility, oral verapamil-SR did not at all affect myocardial contractility or left ventricular function. These cardiovascular effects make verapamil-SR an excellent agent for long-term antihypertensive therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Catheter electrical ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) was attempted in 33 patients who had recurrent unimorphic VT refractory to 3.7 +/- 1.2 (mean +/- SD) antiarrhythmic drugs. Their mean age was 56 +/- 14 years. Twenty-two patients had coronary artery disease, six had other types of heart disease, and five had no structural heart disease. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.34 +/- 0.17. Thirty patients had only one documented morphologic type of spontaneous VT, whereas three patients had more than one. One to four shocks of 100 to 300 J each were delivered to the endocardial exit site of VT, as identified by endocardial activation mapping and pace-mapping. In each patient endocardial activation at the exit site of VT preceded the onset of the QRS complex (mean activation time -50 +/- 30 msec). Pace-mapping was possible in 26 patients, and in all but two patients the QRS complexes during VT and during pacing at the exit site of VT were very similar in at least 10 of 12 electrocardiographic leads. In 29 patients, shocks were delivered between an endocardial electrode (cathode) and a patch electrode on the chest wall (anode). Seven patients (including three who first received shocks using an external anode) whose VT originated in the septum received transseptal shocks between two electrodes positioned on either side of the septum. The procedure was successful in 15 patients (45%), who had no recurrence of VT either on no antiarrhythmic therapy or on the same regimen that was ineffective before ablation, over a follow-up period of 15.5 +/- 10 months (range 5 to 35). The ablation attempt was unsuccessful in 18 patients (55%). There were no significant differences in clinical and electrophysiologic variables between patients with and without a successful outcome. Seven nonfatal complications occurred in six patients: sustained nonclinical VT immediately after the shock, ventricular fibrillation on days 5 and 6 after ablation, neurologic deficits (n = 2), atrioventricular block (n = 2), and brachial artery thrombosis. In conclusion, catheter electrical ablation of VT has modest efficacy and is relatively safe in a selected group of patients who have predominantly one configuration of unimorphic VT.\r"

During electrophysiologic study intravenous (1.5 mg/kg body weight) and oral (240 to 320 mg/day) sotalol caused significant increases of sinus cycle length, AV nodal conduction time, and refractory periods of atrial and ventricular myocardium and accessory pathway. AV reciprocating tachycardia, which was inducible and sustained in 15 patients at control, was still inducible after intravenous sotalol in 14 patients, including one in whom it was not inducible at control. However, tachycardia became nonsustained in 10 patients. In seven patients who underwent repeat drug testing while on oral sotalol, results were the same as after intravenous sotalol. Sixteen patients were followed-up for 36 months (median value). Fifteen of them were clinically free of symptoms or experienced marked improvement, despite recurrences of tachycardia in two. In a third patient sotalol had to be withdrawn because of recurrent supraventricular tachycardia. Orthostatic hypotension occurred in five patients and required withdrawal of sotalol in one. To predict the long-term clinical outcome of patients, exercise testing and Holter monitoring were of little or no value. Programmed electrical stimulation predicted clinical outcome in 63% after intravenous and in 86% after oral sotalol. This study shows that long-term treatment with sotalol is highly effective in patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and regular supraventricular tachycardia.\r"

The result was assessed by phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance of isolated perfused hearts and high-pressure liquid chromatography of freeze-clamped tissues. Hemodynamic data and myocardial oxygen consumption were also monitored. Alcoholic hamsters had significantly higher inorganic phosphate and lower ATP levels, while maintaining normal intracellular pH, phosphocreatine, and creatine. Although coronary flow and oxygen consumption were maintained at normal levels, hamsters ingesting 50% ethanol had significantly lower left ventricular developed pressure and dP/dt. Treatment with verapamil during long-term ethanol consumption prevented the development of these metabolic and functional abnormalities. It is hypothesized that alcohol produces membrane abnormalities leading to adverse ion flux, and that these are largely prevented by concurrent administration of verapamil.\r"

Although antiarrhythmic drugs depress the sodium current in a frequency-dependent fashion in vitro, their effects on conduction in the intact ventricle have been less well studied. We therefore evaluated the frequency- and orientation-dependent actions of mexiletine, quinidine, and their combination on epicardial conduction in 24 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. These interventions were chosen because the time constant of recovery from sodium-channel blockade by mexiletine in vitro is shorter than that from blockade by quinidine, and because we have previously shown that the combination of these drugs is often clinically effective when single-agent therapy fails. An electrode array that permitted measurement of conduction times in multiple orientations over short segments of epicardium without contamination by rapid Purkinje fiber propagation or by latency or virtual cathode effects at the stimulus site was developed for these studies. In all animals, the atrioventricular node was destroyed by injection of formalin to permit measurements over a wide range of cycle lengths (250 to 1500 msec). In the absence of drugs, conduction in any direction was frequency independent. In the presence of mexiletine, however, frequency-dependent increases in conduction times were found at cycle lengths of 600 msec or less; these changes were significantly greater in orientations for which baseline conduction was rapid. Quinidine, on the other hand, increased conduction times at all tested cycle lengths without significant orientation-dependent effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated for 20, 30, 60, and 120 min and then reperfused for 8 hr (groups 1 to 4, respectively). Five hearts were not reperfused (group 5). The areas of CBN and CN were traced at a magnification of X 100 under an inverted microscope and quantified with use of an image analyzer. There was no change in hemodynamics with either occlusion or reperfusion. Regional myocardial blood flow, measured by the generated hydrogen gas clearance method, decreased to almost zero after occlusion but recovered during reperfusion. Percent of risk area infarcted in groups 1 to 4 was 0 +/- 0%, 11 +/- 7%, 80 +/- 9%, and 96 +/- 2%, respectively, and the percent of risk area infarcted in group 4 was the same as that in hearts subjected to permanent occlusion (95 +/- 3%). The percent area of CBN was 100 +/- 0% in group 2, 68 +/- 11% in group 3, 2 +/- 1% in group 4, and 2 +/- 2% in group 5. In group 3, the inner third of the ischemic left ventricular wall showed CN and the middle and outer third CBN. These findings show that in pig hearts without collateral circulation, the transmural infarct, two-thirds of which is occupied by CBN, is evident even when reperfusion is achieved after 1 hr occlusion. Therefore, protection against CBN might reduce infarct size after reperfusion.\r"

All but group 5 received lidocaine (1 mg/min over 8 hr). A critical stenosis was produced and left in place at reperfusion only in group 2. In groups 1 and 2, 111In-labeled autologous neutrophils were injected at the time of coronary occlusion. Group 4 animals were rendered leukopenic 2 hr before the coronary ligature and throughout the experiment by injection of an antineutrophil rabbit serum. Quantification of the radioactivity by digitized scintigraphy of the heart slices revealed an 80% (p less than .05) increase in neutrophil accumulation in the infarct region after reperfusion (group 2) as compared with permanent occlusion (group 1). Gamma counting of myocardial tissue samples showed that the neutrophil accumulation ratio in the subendocardial central zone of the infarct was increased five times (p less than .05) by reperfusion, whereas no difference was evident in the subepicardium. Infarct size and myocardial area at risk were not statistically different among the five groups. However LAD flow in the leukopenic group (group 4) was significantly higher (p less than .05) 30 min after reperfusion (40.0 +/- 5 ml/min) when compared with the preocclusion value (21.7 +/- 4 ml/min). In contrast, in a parallel experiment without leukopenia (group 3), LAD flow after reperfusion did not differ from the preocclusion value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The incidence of recruitable collaterals and their relation to the distal pressure in the occluded artery (coronary wedge pressure) during a 30 sec or longer balloon occlusion was assessed in 57 coronary arteries of 49 patients undergoing PTCA for a proximal coronary stenosis or occlusion. Collateral to 75% of the arteries were present. Spontaneously visible collaterals were four times as frequent as recruitable collaterals. Coronary wedge pressure was significantly higher in arteries with spontaneously visible and recruitable collaterals (41 +/- 12 and 36 +/- 12 mm Hg, respectively) than in arteries without collaterals (18 +/- 4 mm Hg). A coronary wedge pressure of 30 mm Hg or higher was found exclusively in the presence of collaterals. Electrocardiographic changes during balloon occlusion were found more frequently with arteries without collaterals than with arteries with spontaneously visible or recruitable collaterals. Chest pain was more frequent in patients without collaterals or with recruitable collaterals than in those with spontaneously visible collaterals. Major in-hospital events occurred in three patients with collaterals, with a salutary influence of the collaterals in two. The coronary wedge pressure allows prediction of recruitable collaterals. Their clinical impact remains to be investigated in long-term studies on large patient populations.\r"

All patients demonstrated a 1:1 AV relationship during SVT. The study protocol consisted of atrial then ventricular pacing at the SVT cycle length. UCPs were manifested in eight of 28 (29%) patients by either antegrade AV Wenckebach (six patients) or a paced atrium-His (AH) interval exceeding the AH in SVT (two patients, differences 5 and 9 msec). LCPs were manifested in 21 of 28 (75%) patients by either retrograde Wenckebach periodicity (two patients) or a paced HA interval exceeding the HA in SVT (19 patients, mean difference 25 +/- 20 msec). By these criteria, eight patients (29%) had evidence for both UCPs and LCPs. UCPs were more likely than LCPs to be manifested by Wenckebach criteria (p less than .05). Thus the AV nodal reentrant SVT circuit appears to be intranodal and is frequently surrounded by AV nodal tissue (UCP and LCP), antegrade and retrograde conduction properties of these common pathways are discordant in some cases, and conduction properties of UCP tissue differ from those of LCP tissue. These findings may have relevance in that the UCP or LCP may limit the ability of premature extrastimuli to penetrate the circuit to initiate or terminate AV nodal SVT.\r"

  ".U": "87188151\r", 
  ".W": "In clinical cardiac tamponade, open-catheter intrapericardial pressure (IPP) may be used to estimate left ventricular transmural filling pressure (TMFP). However, it has been suggested recently that right atrial pressure (RAP) is superior to IPP in assessing true extracardiac pressure during pericardial drainage. In 10 patients with subacute cardiac tamponade, pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP), RAP, and IPP were measured along with indexes of systolic function. To test the relative merits of IPP and RAP in assessing true pericardial pressure, three TMFP estimates were analyzed: TMFP1 = (PWP - IPP); TMFP2 = (PWP - 1/3 RAP - 2/3 IPP); and TMFP3 = (PWP - RAP). An accurate TMFP presumably should increase during pericardiocentesis and correlate with left ventricular stroke work. In addition, to test the role of preload variation in pulsus paradoxus, respiratory variation in TMFP was analyzed. In the initial tamponade state, RAP and IPP were essentially equal, so all three TMFP estimates gave equivalent results. For instance, TMFP1 averaged 4 +/- 2 mm Hg but fell to 0.2 +/- 1.3 mm Hg during inspiration (p less than .001 vs expiration) and showed beat-by-beat correlation with pulse arterial pressure. After intermediate pericardiocentesis (280 +/- 160 ml), the IPP of 6 +/- 3 mm Hg fell significantly below the RAP of 10 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than .001), but with a 570 +/- 320 ml residual effusion suggesting continued IPP measurement accuracy. By complete pericardiocentesis (810 +/- 430 ml) there was a significant increase in TMFP1 to 8 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than .05 vs tamponade) but not in the TMFP3 of 1 +/- 3 mm Hg. Encompassing tamponade and pericardiocentesis data, left ventricular stroke work index showed positive correlation with TMFP1 (r = .59) and TMFP2 (r = .52) but not with TMFP3. Thus cardiac tamponade often may be diagnosed with a TMFP averaging well above zero, and diastolic equalization of PWP, RAP, and IPP may be a predominantly inspiratory finding (\"inspiratory tracking\"). This supports the role of preload variation in the genesis of pulsus paradoxus. On the other hand, true pericardial pressure may fall substantially below RAP in the course of pericardial drainage. This may be reconciled with the concept that normal pericardial pressure nearly equals RAP by hypothesizing an increased pericardial capacity in subacute tamponade so that pericardiocentesis produces a state analogous to removal of normal pericardial constraint.\r"

Frame-by-frame analysis of stress (sigma) and volume (V) was performed for two differently loaded beats in 26 patients who underwent simultaneous cineangiography and micromanometry: nine normal subjects, eight with isolated aortic regurgitation (AR), and nine with aortic stenosis (AS). Maximum myocardial stiffness (maxEav) was defined as the slope of the end-systolic (es) stress-strain relationship. End-systole was defined as the frame where stiffness was maximal, and strain was defined as epsilon = loge (Dm/Dom), where Dm is left ventricular midwall diameter and Dom is the theoretical Dm at zero stress. Expressed in terms of cavity volume, epsilon = gamma X loge (V/Vo), where gamma is the geometric factor relating Dm to V during systole. Vo was obtained by extrapolating to sigma es = 0 the function, sigma es = maxEav X gamma X loge (Ves/Vo), which was fit to the end-systolic data. Vo always had a value greater than zero. MaxEav was preserved in the AR group (1575 +/- 565) and increased in the AS group (1877 +/- 544; p = .02) compared with normal (1320 +/- 268), suggesting maintenance of contractile force per unit of myocardium in these two lesions. However, theoretical \"unloaded\" shortening fraction (SFo) was depressed in the AS group (0.30 +/- 0.06; p = .01) compared with normal (0.37 +/- 0.04), preserved in the AR group (0.34 +/- 0.07; p = .24), and inversely related to maxEav (r = -.66, p = .01), suggesting a disparity between shortening potential and force potential.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Congenital aortic stenosis in children is characterized by low left ventricular systolic wall stress allowing for supernormal ejection performance. In contrast, adults with acquired aortic stenosis have normal or excessive systolic wall stress resulting in either normal or subnormal ejection performance. In this study young children with congenital aortic stenosis, older children and adults with congenital aortic stenosis, and adults with acquired aortic stenosis were evaluated to test the hypothesis that the childhood pattern of low wall stress would convert to the adult pattern with advancing age. Left ventricular end systolic wall stress was lower in both congenital aortic stenosis groups when compared with that in age-matched normal subjects or adults with acquired aortic stenosis. Ejection fraction was higher in both groups of patients with congenital aortic stenosis than in age-matched controls. There was no tendency in the 16 patients with congenital aortic stenosis, some of whom were followed to the age of 33, for the congenital pattern of wall stress and ventricular performance to convert to the adult pattern. These results suggest that there is a fundamental difference in the hypertrophic response to a pressure overload present at birth compared with the response to one acquired later in life.\r"

  ".W": "On the basis of animal studies, we postulated that the size of the perfusion field (risk area) of an occluded coronary artery would be an important determinant of outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction. To test this hypothesis, we measured size of the risk area in 27 patients with acute myocardial infarction by the intracoronary injection of 99mTc-macroaggregated albumin and gated nuclear imaging. After injection of the albumin spheres (5.3 +/- 1.4 hr after the onset of chest pain) streptokinase was administered and in 16 of 27 patients (59%) effective thrombolysis was achieved. Since none of the patients had evidence of a prior acute myocardial infarction, the 3 day nuclear left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was considered an index of infarct size. Response to thrombolysis was analyzed according to success or failure of reperfusion and the size of the risk area (small risk area less than 25%, large risk area greater than 25% of left ventricular surface area). Standard clinical indexes correlated poorly with size of the risk area: electrocardiographic variables (r = .37), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (r = .23), cardiac index (r = .55), and the LVEF obtained from a right anterior oblique contrast ventriculogram (r = .31). The coronary vessel responsible for the acute myocardial infarction significantly influenced size of the risk area (left anterior descending, 38 +/- 5% [mean +/- SD] vs circumflex or right coronary artery, 17 +/- 4%). However, knowledge of the site of coronary occlusion within a vessel was not helpful in predicting the size of the area at risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Postmortem examination performed in three of the four patients showed extensive infarction of the right and left ventricles.

During long-term follow-up (1 to 4 years) resting radionuclide ventriculography demonstrated a significant improvement in right ventricular ejection fraction (30 +/- 7% to 43 +/- 8%; p less than .001) and right ventricular wall motion index (2.2 +/- 0.4 to 1.5 +/- 0.5; p less than .001) in 18 patients who survived longer than 1 year.

The direction and magnitude of change of the right ventricular ejection fraction correlated significantly with the left ventricular ejection fraction (r = .82, p less than .02).

These trials have been of short duration and primarily designed to answer questions about dosages, mechanisms, and toxicity, and therefore they have not been particularly useful in addressing the issue of survival. Despite this drawback, these small clinical trials have been important in providing data about drugs that might be used in large-scale controlled clinical trials designed to test the survival hypothesis--that specific therapy may prolong life in patients with congestive heart failure. Nitrates, hydralazine, and the converting-enzyme inhibitors have emerged as the vasodilators that are most promising in our quest to prolong survival in patients with chronic heart failure. Milrinone has been perhaps the most extensively studied inotropic-vasodilator drug, but there are no data so far to suggest that it may prolong survival. The principal questions that need to be addressed are: Do vasodilators that improve symptoms also improve survival? Which vasodilator drug regimen is most effective in prolonging survival? Should inotropic agents be considered for survival trials? What dose of vasodilator should be used? When in the natural course of the disease should therapy be initiated? Answers are now available to some of these questions, but large-scale clinical trials will be necessary to clarify all of the answers.\r"

The age-adjusted relative risk (RR) of cardiovascular disease deaths in users compared with nonusers was 0.34 (95% confidence limits 0.12 to 0.81). After multivariable adjustment for potential confounding factors (age, blood pressure, and smoking), the estimated RR for estrogen use was 0.37 (95% confidence limits 0.16 to 0.88). Analyses were done to explore whether these results could be due to selection bias for estrogen use. However, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease at baseline was slightly higher in estrogen users (12%) than in nonusers (10%); furthermore, the exclusion of all women with prevalent cardiovascular disease at baseline did not alter the apparent protective effect of estrogen use on cardiovascular disease mortality (RR = 0.42, 95% confidence limits 0.13 to 1.10). Additional analyses examining the complex association between estrogen use, lipoprotein levels, and cardiovascular disease mortality suggest that the protective effect of estrogen is substantially mediated through increased high-density lipoprotein levels.\r"

The rate of myocardial infarction was higher (p less than .01) in patients with a fixed stenosis of 90% or greater than in patients with a fixed stenosis of less than 90% or normal coronary arteries. Myocardial infarctions occurred predominantly during hospital stays or at a time when the frequency of vasospastic angina increased. There were five sudden deaths (2%). Only one patient suffering sudden death had a fixed stenosis of 75% or greater. Serious arrhythmias were noted in 49 patients (14%). The risk of arrhythmias did not depend on the presence of a fixed stenosis of 75% or greater. These results suggest that cardiac events are rather infrequent in Japanese patients with vasospastic angina who are receiving treatment with calcium blockers and that the presence of a severe fixed stenosis markedly increases the risk of myocardial infarction but not the risk of arrhythmias.\r"

Thirty-two of 295 patients in whom a diagnosis of VSD was made by two-dimensional echocardiography and who were studied from June 1983 to April 1985 presented with a subaortic shelf. Every patient (p less than .00001) had a malalignment type of defect; the defect was produced by anterior deviation of the outlet septum (without compromise of the right ventricular outflow tract) in 28 and by posterior deviation of the infundibular septum in four. The prevalence of a subaortic shelf in the malalignment VSD group was 82% (32/39). Among the 28 patients with a subaortic ridge and anterior deviation of the outlet septum only three had aortic coarctation, but all four patients with subaortic stenosis and posterior infundibular malalignment had obstructive lesions of the aortic arch--coarctation in three and interruption of the aortic arch in one (p less than .001). We conclude that a malalignment type of VSD may be a consistent feature in patients with VSD and associated discrete subaortic stenosis. We also noted a high prevalence of subaortic ridge in the presence of a malalignment VSD and therefore speculate that there may be a common morphogenesis for malalignment VSD, subaortic shelf, and obstructive lesions of the aortic arch.\r"

In all patients, abnormal Doppler signals indicating left-to-right (L-R) or right-to-left shunt flow or both could be obtained at the site of the ductus arteriosus. These Doppler flow patterns determined within the ductus coincided with the direction of ductal flow seen on the contrast two-dimensional echocardiogram. No Doppler signals of shunt flow were demonstrated in any of 42 control subjects. The peak, mean, and diastolic velocities of the L-R shunt flow within the ductus were measured from the ductal flow velocity profiles. With the Doppler-derived measurements of the mean and diastolic velocities, patients with normal pulmonary arterial pressure and those with evidence of pulmonary hypertension could be correctly identified. In addition, the mean velocity of the diastolic antegrade flow portion obtained from the proximal left pulmonary artery, which was related to ductal L-R shunting, was measured in 16 patients with isolated PDA. This Doppler flow determinant showed a good linear correlation with the L-R shunt ratio determined by Fick's method (r = .88, p less than .01). Our technique permits the noninvasive evaluation of shunt flow dynamics in patients with PDA.\r"

The tissue form of MM creatine kinase (MM3) is known to undergo posttranslational conversion to modified forms MM2 and MM1 after release into the plasma following acute infarction. Since this conversion is rapid, sustained elevation of plasma MM3 may be a marker of the prolonged creatine kinase release characteristic of nonreperfused infarction. Therefore, we investigated the rate of decline of plasma MM3 in a consecutive series of patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy of acute myocardial infarction, all of whom underwent acute angiography to assess treatment success, as well as in 30 conventionally treated patients. Among 55 patients with angiographically documented successful reperfusion (group IA), the rate of decline of MM3 was 4.18 +/- 1.25%/hr (mean +/- SD); in contrast, the rate of decline was 2.37 +/- 1.11%/hr in 39 patients with angiographically documented unsuccessful reperfusion (group IB) and 1.77 +/- 1.46%/hr among the 30 patients receiving conventional treatment (group II) (p less than .001 for groups IB and II vs group IA). A cutoff value of 3.1%/hr minimized the overlap between the groups; 48/55 (87%) patients with successful reperfusion had a rate of decline of MM3 of 3.1%/hr or more, while 29 of 39 (74%) patients in whom thrombolysis was unsuccessful and 27 of 30 (90%) patients receiving conventional treatment had a rate of decline less than 3.1%/hr (p less than .001 for groups IB and II vs group IA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The formation of factor XIIIa-catalyzed fibrin polymers during clotting of plasma and purified fibrinogen in vivo was followed by a sodium dodecyl sulfate agarose gel technique, and an increase in both amount and size of gamma-chain cross-linked polymers was demonstrated before visible clot formation. Plasma from patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction showed increases in the plasma concentration of fibrin polymer and in the proportion of total fibrinogen present as polymer, as determined by a quantitative adaptation of the electrophoretic technique. The plasma concentration in patients with subendocardial or transmural myocardial infarction showed significant (p less than .005) increases to 4.0 +/- 1.0% and 3.6 +/- .8%, respectively, as compared with the concentration in normal plasma (0.8 +/- 0.1%). There was no difference in plasma concentration in samples from patients with transmural compared with those with subendocardial myocardial infarction. This study provides the first demonstration of factor XIIIa cross-linked fibrin polymers in thrombotic disease and indicates the presence of increased activity of both thrombin and factor XIIIa in patients with acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Sustained VT was induced by one to three ventricular extrastimuli in 28 patients (45%). Therapy was guided by the results of electrophysiologic testing in 44 patients: 19 patients without inducible sustained VT received no antiarrhythmic therapy, and 25 patients with inducible sustained or symptomatic nonsustained VT received therapy guided by the results of electrophysiologic studies. The results of electrophysiologic studies were ignored by physicians for a second group of 18 patients: four had inducible sustained VT but received no antiarrhythmic therapy, and 14 had inducible sustained or nonsustained VT and received antiarrhythmic therapy not guided by results of electrophysiologic testing. After a mean follow-up period of 28 months, 11 patients had died suddenly. Seven of the 11 patients who died suddenly had inducible sustained VT. Three of 44 patients in the group receiving therapy guided by electrophysiologic studies died suddenly versus eight of 18 in the group receiving therapy not guided by electrophysiologic studies (p = .001). Only one of 19 patients without inducible sustained VT who were not treated experienced sudden death. Two of four patients with inducible sustained VT who did not receive antiarrhythmic therapy died suddenly. Multivariate analysis of the relationship of induced arrhythmias, left ventricular ejection fraction, site of myocardial infarction, history of syncope, or type of antiarrhythmic therapy to outcome revealed a greater than twofold increased risk for sudden cardiac death in patients whose therapy was not guided by results of electrophysiologic study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The incidence and possible causes of paradoxical hypertension were evaluated in eight children who underwent balloon dilatation and seven children who underwent surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta. Both procedures resulted in a significant reduction in the coarctation gradient. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased in the surgical group after repair, whereas systolic pressures decreased and diastolic pressures remained unchanged after balloon angioplasty. In the surgical group, but not in the balloon angioplasty group, plasma catecholamines and plasma renin activity rose during the first 2 days after relief of the coarctation. The data presented in this report support the hypothesis that the sympathetic nervous system and the renin angiotensin system are important mediators of the paradoxical hypertension that occurs after surgical repair of coarctation. Furthermore, balloon angioplasty of coarctation of the aorta does not stimulate either system and thus paradoxical hypertension is not a complication of this procedure.\r"

Mean (+/- SEM) left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.20 +/- 0.03. Simultaneous left ventricular pressure and radionuclide angiographic volume were obtained at baseline, during infusion of nitroprusside, and after intravenous administration of enoximone. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and volume (LVEDV) decreased with both agents (p less than .01 vs control); LVEDP was lower for nitroprusside than for enoximone (p less than .01) despite a similar LVEDV. Nitroprusside decreased the time constant of exponential left ventricular pressure decay, TL (measured by the logarithmic method), from 84 +/- 10 to 65 +/- 8 msec (p less than .01) but had no significant effect on TD (measured by the derivative method), maximum negative dP/dt, or the peak rate of early diastolic filling. Enoximone shortened TL from 86 +/- 12 to 61 +/- 9 msec (p less than .01) and increased maximum negative dP/dt from 897 +/- 101 to 1135 +/- 134 mm Hg/sec (p less than .01) but did not affect TD or the peak filling rate. The left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relation was shifted downward in only three of 11 patients on nitroprusside and three of 11 patients on enoximone, and these shifts were attenuated by adjusting for simultaneous changes in right atrial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Infusion of 0.1 microgram/kg/min isoproterenol or 10 micrograms/kg/min dobutamine markedly increased heart rate and systemic and pulmonary blood flows, while stroke volume and the left-to-right shunt flow did not change. Since pulmonary blood flow increased and the left-to-right shunt flow did not change, the left-to-right shunt fraction decreased with the infusions of isoproterenol and dobutamine. The hemodynamic changes during the infusion of isoproterenol and dobutamine occurred immediately after the start of infusion and stabilized within a few minutes. The pattern of hemodynamic changes was not influenced by the presence of an aortopulmonary left-to-right shunt or by age. Infusion of 10 micrograms/kg/min dopamine caused only small hemodynamic changes. This study shows that heart rate and systemic blood flow in the lamb are closely related. Furthermore, it demonstrates that despite an increased systemic blood flow, left-to-right shunt flow does not change after infusion of isoproterenol and dobutamine. Any decision as to which positive inotropic agent might be preferred at an early age should await experimental work concerning the effect of these agents on the myocardial oxygen demand and on the distribution of the systemic blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "Previously, we have shown that pericardial constraint cannot be measured by true (hydrostatic) pressure except when an excess of pericardial fluid is present and that a device such as a balloon (which reflects radial contact stress as well as hydrostatic pressure) must be used. Since radial contact stress is the major component of the constraint exerted by the pericardium when little pericardial liquid is present, it follows that the pressure measured by the balloon might be different over different parts of the heart. In an attempt to test this hypothesis, in 11 anesthetized dogs we placed pericardial balloons over the right and left ventricular free walls, instrumented the animals to measure ventricular dimensions (sonomicrometry) and pressure, mounted pneumatic constrictors on the aortic and pulmonary artery, reapproximated the pericardium, and closed the chest under suction. We studied the transient effects of constrictions of the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery and of angiotensin infusion before and after intravenous saline infusion. Aortic constriction and, to a lesser degree, angiotensin increased pericardial pressure over the left ventricle more than over the right ventricle. Pulmonary artery occlusion increased pericardial pressure over the right ventricle but significantly decreased pericardial pressure over the left ventricle. We conclude that there are significant local differences in pericardial pressure (recorded by balloon) over the lateral ventricular surfaces during acute changes in afterload. These observations may be explained in part by decreased venous return to the contralateral ventricle, the tendency of the heart to resist lateral displacement, and the limited mobility of the pericardium.\r"

  ".U": "87188193\r", 
  ".W": "Reactive oxygen species such as the superoxide anion (.O2-) have recently been implicated as important agents involved in causing cell death in the setting of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. When superoxide anion is involved in ischemic injury the administration of superoxide dismutase (SOD) may limit infarct size by reducing the level of superoxide anions in the myocardium. The study described herein was done to determine whether SOD could limit myocardial infarct size when infarcts were produced in dogs by a 40 min occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery followed by 4 days of reperfusion. The animals in the SOD treatment group received a 1 hr intra-atrial infusion of SOD, at a rate of 250 U/kg/min starting 15 min after occlusion and ending 35 min after reperfusion; control dogs received a saline infusion over the same time frame. Infarct size was determined histologically and expressed as a percentage of the anatomic area at risk (AAR). Infarct size was similar in the two groups, averaging 26.2 +/- 2.5% in the control group (n = 10) and 21.1 +/- 4.8% in the SOD group (n = 11) (p = .40). Hemodynamic variables were not statistically different in the two groups during the occlusion. The transmural mean collateral blood flow at 10 min into the 40 min occlusion was 0.13 +/- 0.02 ml/min/g in the controls and 0.17 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g in the SOD group (p = NS); moreover, SOD did not alter collateral blood flow. In control dogs, infarct size was inversely related to collateral blood flow; analysis of covariance showed that SOD did not shift this relationship. Thus, SOD did not limit infarct size in this study. The results of the current study are consistent with our previous study in which allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, did not limit infarct size in this same experimental preparation. The results suggest that superoxide anions that are accessible to the infused SOD are not a major cause of myocyte death caused by 40 min of severe ischemia followed by reperfusion.\r"

  ".U": "87188194\r", 
  ".W": "Because the left ventricular \"area at risk\" is the most important determinant of ultimate infarct size, it would be useful to know the size of the area at risk during acute myocardial infarction to make therapeutic decisions. We therefore performed a series of experiments in four groups of dogs. In group I dogs (n = 15) we attempted to determine whether current methods of assessing left ventricular function during acute myocardial infarction reflect the true size of the area at risk. At each of two to five sequential stages, a more proximal coronary occlusion was performed to produce a larger area at risk until cardiovascular collapse occurred. At each stage, the area at risk (measured by myocardial contrast echocardiography), hemodynamic variables, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured. Hemodynamic variables became abnormal when the area at risk was large (25% to 40% of the left ventricle), whereas LVEF became abnormal when the area at risk was of moderate size (18%). When cardiac output and LVEF were normalized to baseline values, a close inverse relationship was noted between these variables and area at risk. In contrast, there was a poor relationship between normalized mean arterial pressure and area at risk (r = .42). In group II dogs (n = 9) the area at risk was measured serially over 6 hr after coronary occlusion. The size of the area at risk remained unchanged regardless of the transmural extent of the ultimate infarct. The circumferential endocardial extent of the area at risk closely predicted the circumferential endocardial extent of the infarct at 6 hr in eight of nine dogs that developed an infarct. Group III dogs (n = 7) underwent the same protocol as group II dogs, but the duration of occlusion was 3 hr. The circumferential endocardial extent of the area at risk closely predicted the circumferential endocardial extent of the infarct. Group IV dogs (n = 5) underwent subtotal coronary occlusion. Although regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in this group, no area at risk could be defined. We conclude that although a close inverse relationship is noted between normalized cardiac output and area at risk, the absolute values for cardiac output and other hemodynamic variables become abnormal only when the area at risk is large (25% to 40%); measurement of LVEF may provide a better assessment of the size of the area at risk than hemodynamic variables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In a randomized sequence, inflations were performed for 3 min in the left circumflex coronary artery of 12 dogs with the standard catheter followed by the autoperfusion catheter or vice versa. During inflation with the standard catheter, the ST segment of standard limb lead II increased from -0.02 +/- 0.03 mV to 0.39 +/- 0.08 mV (p less than .001), whereas during inflation with the autoperfusion catheter the ST segment did not change (-0.03 +/- 0.03 vs -0.01 +/- 0.04 mV; p = NS). Regional myocardial blood flow measured by the radioactive microsphere technique in the posterior subepicardium and subendocardium was 0.12 +/- 0.03 and 0.08 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g, respectively, with the standard catheter as compared with 0.57 +/- 0.08 and 0.61 +/- 0.14 ml/min/g with the autoperfusion catheter (both p less than .01 compared with the standard catheter). Thus, unlike the standard catheter, the autoperfusion catheter allows for inflations up to 3 min in duration without producing deleterious changes in the ST segment or severe reductions in regional myocardial blood flow.\r"

Nineteen vessels in 13 rabbits underwent either laser thermal or balloon angioplasty in random order. Laser thermal angioplasty was performed in a total of nine vessels with either a 1.5 or 2.0 mm laser-heated metallic-capped fiber by delivery of 6 or 8 W, respectively, of argon laser energy for 5 sec duration during continuous advancement through the stenosis. Balloon angioplasty was performed in a total of 10 stenotic lesions with a 2.5 mm balloon catheter. The immediate enlargement of the angiographic luminal diameters was similar for both procedures: from 1.0 +/- 0.2 to 1.9 +/- 0.2 mm for laser thermal angioplasty vs 1.0 +/- 0.1 to 2.0 +/- 0.2 mm for balloon angioplasty. However, 4 weeks later the vessels treated with laser thermal angioplasty had less restenosis, defined as a 20% or greater reduction in luminal diameter (two of nine vessels [22%] vs 10 of 10 vessels [100%]; p less than .001), and a significantly larger mean luminal diameter (1.6 +/- 0.5 vs 1.0 +/- 0.4 mm) than those treated with conventional balloon angioplasty (p less than .02). Histologic examination 4 weeks after the procedure revealed less fibrocellular proliferation after laser thermal angioplasty, whereas those vessels treated with balloon angioplasty demonstrated evidence of prior fracture and dissection of the vessel wall with more of a fibrocellular proliferative response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of our study was to assess whether or not the phenomenon of load-dependent relaxation is present in the intact heart and to describe the left ventricular response to abrupt load increments (volume steps) throughout the cardiac cycle. Using a microcomputer-controlled servo-pump attached to the apex of an intact canine heart, we studied the effects of 6 ml steps on left ventricular pressure transients during relaxation. Each volume step was carried out in a single beat with 20 stabilization beats separating the intervention beats; thus, at a heart rate of 120 beats/min, a sequence of 10 intervention beats could be carried out in less than 2 min. By performing the experiments on a single-beat basis (control vs intervention beat), we were able to minimize reflex and other physiologic feedback mechanisms that might alter the results. Studies were performed in five anesthetized dogs. In ejecting beats, an early step (immediately after aortic valve opening) caused an increase (3%) in the duration of systole (the time from the onset of pressure rise to the instant at which left ventricular pressure had declined to one-half its maximal value); in contrast, a late step (just before aortic value closure) caused a decrease (7%) in the duration of systole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of changes in afterload, heart rate, intravascular volume, autonomic tone, and inotropic state on the ESPVR in conscious dogs. In 30 dogs, left ventricular and pleural pressures were measured with micromanometers, and left ventricular volume was assessed with global ultrasonic crystals. The ESPVR was obtained during vena caval occlusions in each dog during pharmacologic afterload interventions at control and after autonomic blockade. Analysis of variance techniques were used to compare the slopes (Emax) and intercepts (Vd) of ESPVR regression lines in a given study. All estimates of the ESPVR in conscious dogs involved large extrapolations to obtain estimates of Vd. Repeat determinations of Emax at control in the unblocked state were significantly different in six of eight dogs (p less than .05). After autonomic blockade, these differences were significant in only one of eight dogs. Changes in heart rate and volume loading had minimal effects on the ESPVR. In the absence of autonomic blockade, increases in inotropic state with either calcium or dobutamine tended to cause parallel shifts in the ESPVR. After autonomic blockade, Emax increased with augmentation of inotropic state, while Vd was unchanged. ESPVRs obtained at different afterloads showed statistically significant differences in Emax and in Vd in 12 of 14 dogs. However, no statistically significant relationship of Emax to afterload was observed. Thus, the ESPVR is probably valid in conscious dogs, but measurement with an intact cardiovascular system is hampered by statistically significant variability in Emax and Vd with changes in afterload. Baseline variability is magnified by the autonomic nervous system, probably mediated through sympathetic reflexes.\r"

  ".W": "To examine left ventricular function in mitral regurgitation (MR), we compared the ejection phase indexes of left ventricular contractility with maximal systolic elastance (Emax) in an experimental preparation of MR. In eight anesthetized open-chest dogs, pressure-volume loops were derived during afterload manipulation with methoxamine and nitroprusside from simultaneous left ventricular pressure and dimensional (sonomicrometry techniques) data before and after creation of MR. From these data maximal systolic elastance (Emax), the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR), and the end-systolic stress-volume relationship (ESSVR) were determined by linear regression analysis. After creation of MR, end-diastolic volume increased significantly (40 +/- 13 to 53 +/- 18 ml, p less than .001); likewise end-systolic volume increased (28 +/- 11 to 33 +/- 15 ml, p less than .05). Ejection fraction increased after MR (35 +/- 6% to 44 +/- 8%, p less than .005), as did the mean velocity of fiber shortening (0.62 +/- 0.20 to 1.02 +/- 0.39 sec-1, p less than .02). In contrast, Emax declined significantly (4.63 +/- 2.5 to 3.54 +/- 1.94 mm Hg/ml, p less than .05); ESPVR and ESSVR showed similar directional changes. An inverse relationship was found between systolic elastance and end-diastolic volume in both control and MR states. When Emax, ESPVR, and ESSVR were normalized to end-diastolic volume, they were unchanged after MR. These results suggest that either there was a decline in left ventricular contractile state after MR, or that contractility was unchanged (if elastance is normalized for increased contractility, but occurred as a consequence of increased preload with no significant change in afterload.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively evaluated 241 consecutive patients with creatine kinase (MB fraction)-confirmed acute myocardial infarction with predischarge quantitative thallium-201 scintigraphy, coronary angiography, radionuclide ventriculography, and 24 hr Holter monitoring. Based on serial electrocardiograms, 154 patients had Q wave (QMI) and 87 had non-Q wave (NQMI) infarction. Despite less myocardial necrosis and better left ventricular function, the NQMI group had the same long-term survival as the QMI group. During 27 months of follow-up, patients with NQMI experienced more reinfarctions (p = .009), had a higher rate of unstable angina pectoris requiring rehospitalization (p = .034), and had a greater likelihood of subsequent bypass surgery or angioplasty (p = .018). Based on our thallium scintigraphic data, the greater clinical instability after NQMI appeared to be related to the presence of a larger residual mass of viable but jeopardized myocardium within the perfusion zone of the infarct-related vessel. Our results also indicate that the pathogenesis of NQMI may involve early spontaneous reperfusion and that patients with NQMI can experience sudden death despite well-preserved left ventricular function.\r"

  ".W": "Hypoxia and ischemia produce depression of myocardial contractile function and alterations in calcium homeostasis. Although both functional abnormalities and alterations in calcium handling are reversible under some conditions, reoxygenation or reperfusion can also lead to paradoxical augmentation of injury. Under many conditions of ischemia and reperfusion, however, a causal relation between altered calcium handling and cellular injury has been difficult to establish. Calcium entry through specific calcium channels during and after hypoxic insult can account for only a fraction of the observed pathologic transsarcolemmal calcium flux; sodium-calcium exchange also appears to contribute to calcium influx but to a limited degree. During reoxygenation calcium also appears to enter through nonspecific sarcolemmal permeability changes. The hypothesis that mitochondria are calcium loaded by hypoxia and reoxygenation and that the calcium loading produces mitochondrial dysfunction has not been substantiated convincingly. Brief hypoxia can produce mitochondrial dysfunction without mitochondrial calcium overload, whereas calcium overload per se does not initially produce irreversible cellular injury. Under conditions of prolonged ischemic insult, with or without reperfusion, it is likely that disturbed calcium homeostasis does play a role in ultimate cellular injury. However, available data fall short of establishing intracellular calcium overload as a necessary or sufficient condition to produce irreversible myocardial cell injury.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined whether combination therapy with allopurinol plus verapamil would enhance limitation of myocardial infarct size compared with either allopurinol or verapamil alone in closed-chest dogs subjected to 24 hr of permanent coronary occlusion. Four groups were studied: control, dogs receiving allopurinol (400 mg po 24 and 2 hr before coronary occlusion and 10 mg/kg iv 6 hr after occlusion), dogs receiving verapamil (200 micrograms/kg iv bolus, then continuous administration of 5 micrograms/kg/min), and dogs receiving allopurinol plus verapamil as indicated above. The anatomic risk zone and regional myocardial blood flow were measured with radioactive microspheres administered intraventricularly 1 min after coronary occlusion. Necrotic tissue was visualized by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining and the risk zone by autoradiography of the microspheres. Infarct size, expressed as a percentage of the risk zone, was 75.9 +/- 13.7% (mean +/- SD) in the control group, 44.1 +/- 13.3% in the allopurinol group (p less than .05 vs control), 40.6 +/- 11.1% in the verapamil group (p less than .05 vs control), and 37.9 +/- 13.6% in the allopurinol plus verapamil group (p less than .05 vs control; p = NS vs drug-treated groups). In controls, there was a close correlation (r = -.83) between infarct size and subepicardial collateral blood flow. As a result the expected infarct size in the treatment group that would have occurred without drug-treatment could be reliably predicted based on the correlation between infarct size and subepicardial collateral blood flow. The ratio of the actual and predicted infarct size provides a \"salvage index\".(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The two-year survival rate was 78.4% for patients with a urea-creatinine ratio under 25.5 (lowest tertile) and 42.1% for patients with a urea-creatinine ratio over 31.3 (highest tertile). The correlation of the urea-creatinine ratio and survival was investigated by forming exponential models involving potential confounding factors. The relationship between the urea-creatinine ratio and survival did not disappear after adjusted by age, sex, blood pressure, body mass index and primary renal disease. The goodness of the fit of the exponential model for survival was significantly poorer if the urea-creatinine ratio, diastolic blood pressure and patients' age were deleted. Thus these factors had a marked and independent effect on survival. The relative risk of death was 1.8 for patients with a urea-creatinine ratio of 30 and 3.4 for patients with a urea-creatinine ratio of 40 when the risks of death were compared with the situation in which the urea-creatinine ratio was 20. The urea-creatinine ratio seems to play a role in predicting the survival of hemodialysis patients. It may thus be one of the very few survival affecting factors which can be influenced by active procedures.\r"

We now observed a new type in a 15-year-old boy who had a complete absence of tubular glucose reabsorption. His father had a daily glucosuria of 1.1 g/1.73 m2 and his mother of 2.7 g/1.73 m2. Two siblings excreted 0.4 g/1.73 m2 and 0.3 g/1.73 m2 glucose and one sister had no glucosuria. The proband excreted daily 136 to 160 g/1.73 m2 glucose accompanied by normal blood glucose levels between 75-105 mg/dl. The glomerular filtration rate (inulin clearance) was 148-153 ml/min/1.73 m2 and the endogenous glucose clearance was 112-160 ml/min/1.73 m2 when blood glucose levels were 72-82 mg/dl. Thus, glucose clearance was nearly identical to inulin-clearance. After intravenous glucose loading with a blood glucose concentration of 261-342 mg/dl, glucose clearance remained in the same range and tubular glucose reabsorption was virtually absent. There were no disturbances in tubular reabsorption of other substrates. This new type of primary renal glucosuria was not recognized thus far, and we propose to call it type O glucosuria. The family tree revealed consanguinity and most probably the proband is homozygous and both his parents are heterozygous for type O renal glucosuria.\r"

The incidence was highest in the urban areas and lowest in the rural areas during both periods. This was most marked for cervical fractures and for women. The increase in incidence was the same in the rural and urban populations. A possible reason for the lower incidence of hip fractures in rural communities is that a more physically active life-style may protect against osteoporosis and fracture. Account should be taken of the lower incidence in rural areas when calculating the national hospital resources needed to care for hip fracture patients.\r"

Radiolucent lines greater than or equal to 1 mm were noted around 26.5% of femoral components. These were asymptomatic, unless associated with the presence of infection, subsidence greater than 5 mm, or symptoms of acetabular loosening. True femoral subsidence was pain free and nonprogressive in seven patients (6%) if less than or equal to 5 mm. Femoral loosening was roentgenographically observed as component migration or subsidence greater than 5 mm. By these criteria, three femoral components (2.6%) were loose, although none have been revised.\r"

Other prominent features included particles of acrylic cement, polyethylene debris, and fragments of necrotic bone. Mechanical failure was characterized by cement fractures, and microfracture of bone. The presence of cement debris and bone detritus in the membranes, and smooth appearance of the removed cement mantles substantiated the presence of mechanical failure. The process of loosening was characterized by the recruitment of histiocytes into the interface and the subsequent resorption of bone around the prosthesis. This may be a manifestation of the rate of cement wear and tear, particle size, and the immunologic predispositions of the host. These observations on interfaces of loosened prostheses are reexamined and reinterpreted in the light of radiologic observations on interface radiolucent zones and well-functioning prostheses.\r"

Seven of these nerve palsies occurred among 614 consecutive patients treated at one institution during the period 1983-1985. This corresponded to an overall incidence of 1.1%.

Follow-up neurologic evaluations showed a greater neurologic improvement in the 20 patients who were treated with anterior spinal SD as compared to the 39 patients who received posterior or lateral SD (88% vs. 64%). The return of normal bowel and bladder control also occurred more frequently in the anteriorly SD group than the posteriorly treated SD group (69% vs. 33%). The inferior results in the posteriorly treated SD group appeared to correlate with a high incidence of bony stenosis as measured on postoperative computed axial tomography.\r"

This investigation assessed the efficacy of combining freeze-dried cortical allografts in three to six weeks azathioprine-immunosuppressed dogs. Forty-eight of 94 adult mongrel dogs were initiated for this study, and 46 of 94 were previously published and recompiled. The dogs were divided into five groups and followed for six months: Group I consisted of bilateral fresh autografts as an external control; Group II assessed the effect of freeze-drying on autogenous bone; Group III compared fresh autografts with fresh allografts; Group IV assessed the effect of freeze-drying on allografts; and Group V assessed the combined effect of placing freeze-dried allografts in immunosuppressed hosts. Biweekly roentgenograms were made to evaluate the time to union and the incidence of graft fatigue failure. Mechanical graft strength was assessed by rapid torsional loading to failure at the time of sacrifice. Biologic repair was assessed with the use of tetracycline and microradiographic techniques. The incorporation and repair of a fresh cortical autograft is better than that of a freeze-dried autograft because of fractures, nonunion, or delayed union of graft-host junctions; freeze-dried autografts have increased peripheral and internal resorption, yet an increased peripheral bony callus maintains normal graft strength; freeze-dried and fresh allografts are similar in roentgenographic characteristics, mechanical strength, and in the mechanism of graft incorporation; the use of three or six weeks azathioprine therapy did not improve the fate of freeze-dried allografts.\r"

The bone grown adjacent to the implant was predominantly of recipient type in all of the specimens (p less than 0.01). Most of the chondrocytes gradually lost stainability to Feulgen-Schiff stain as they matured, and only a few cells were stained in the calcified zone, indicating the deterioration of nuclear DNA. Thus, the majority of the growth plate chondrocytes are considered to die and be replaced by osteoblasts of a different origin.\r"

A study of the underlying biochemical events would contribute to a better understanding of the control of longitudinal growth rate in epiphyseal growth plates and of the molecular pathology of exaggerated physiologic bowleg or knock-knee deformities. Blount stainless staples were applied to the medial side of the proximal tibia epiphyseal growth plate of domestic pigs. The resulting biochemical changes were investigated by incubation of the isolated growth plate cartilage under organ culture conditions. On the fourth to the eighth day after stapling, a significant decrease of [14C]glucose uptake and lactate formation and a significantly lower specific radioactivity of the isolated glycosaminoglycans were observed in relation to the controls. During the second to 12th week, the incorporation of [3H]thymidine and the specific radioactivity of the glycosaminoglycans following incubation with [14C]glucose showed statistically significant decreases. The glycosaminoglycan content of the cartilage was not altered, but the chondroitin sulfate/keratan sulfate ratio was lower in the stapled than in the nonstapled areas. In this period, glucose uptake and lactate production were found to be normalized.\r"

Canine femurs were pressurized with air to 250-300 mm Hg or with low-viscosity cement to 300-900 mm Hg. Pressurization with low-viscosity cement from distal to proximal with a plugged femur revealed no change in pO2, pCO2, pulmonary artery pressure, or end-tidal CO2. Air pressurization resulted in significant increases in pCO2, pulmonary artery pressure, and end-tidal CO2, and a decrease in pO2. Pressurization of the medullary canal with xenon-labeled air was used to document pulmonary embolism. In a clinical setting, two different femoral cementing techniques during total hip arthroplasty were studied to determine their effect on hemodynamic parameters associated with embolic phenomenon. Five patients had a plugged femoral canal filled from proximal to distal with a vent tube, followed by finger-packing. Three of the patients demonstrated a significant drop in pO2 and blood pressure and a rise in pCO2 and end-tidal CO2. Five other patients had their plugged femoral canals filled from distal to proximal, three with regular cement and two with low-viscosity cement, with no significant cardiopulmonary changes. The adverse cardiopulmonary effects reported during hip arthroplasty appear to be avoided by eliminating air during the cementing procedure, by filling a plugged canal from distal to proximal.\r"

Previous investigations have indicated that one important factor in the development of Mn rickets is phosphate depletion, because of the precipitation of insoluble manganese phosphate in the gut. In the present study, the morphologic and biochemical changes in rickets induced by phosphate (P) depletion per se as well as in florid and healing Mn rickets were investigated. Rachitic changes were induced in young rats by giving dietary Mn (2%) or by phosphate depletion (0.02% P) for 25 days. The rachitic changes of the proximal tibial growth plate were quantitated with the use of stereologic methods. In addition, the growth plates were dissected into one upper and one lower part and proteoglycans were separately extracted with 4 M guanidine hydrochloride and purified by ultracentrifugation. In rats given phosphate in more than equimolar amounts relative to Mn, the rachitic changes were abolished. When rats with florid Mn rickets were given standard rat food, containing 1% P, rapid healing ensued. Moreover, similar rachitic changes were obtained by phosphate depletion alone. Proteoglycans from the lowermost tissue portion of rachitic growth plates readily formed aggregates with hyaluronic acid and also contained larger chondroitin sulphate chains than controls. Upon healing, these changes tended to normalize. The data support the concept that phosphate depletion is crucial in the pathogenesis of Mn rickets. Also, it seems that the biochemical changes in different forms of rickets are of a similar kind, which further underlines the importance of proteoglycans in enchondral bone formation.\r"

The outcome of the fractures was related to different types of treatment centers (orthopedic and surgical) and primary treatments (conservative, internal fixation, and hemiarthroplasty [HAP]). The treatment results of the four most common types of internal fixation (von Bahr, Hessel/Nystrom, Thornton, and Rydell nails), the experience of the surgeons, and the operative delay were also compared. Of 2418 patients, the majority (93%) were treated with internal fixation. Thirty-three percent of patients sustained complications after conservative treatment, 37% after primary internal fixation, and 15% after primary HAP. Early redisplacement of the fracture was most common when the Thornton nail was used and when less experienced surgeons treated the fractures. Early complications such as redisplacement and nonunion occurred most often in surgical departments, but the total frequency of complications including segmental collapse was equal for different treatment centers. In surgical departments these fractures were operatively treated most often by less experienced surgeons and the Thornton nail was used more frequently than in orthopedic departments. An operative delay of up to one week did not result in more complications. Seventy percent of the complications after primary treatment were reoperated. Only 11% were not reoperated, either because of the presence of only minor symptoms, or because of the patient's poor general condition, which made reoperation too risky. The results of the present study stress the importance of stable fixation of this fracture and of the experience of the surgeon for optimal treatment results.\r"

The total annual number of hospital days was reduced by about one-third during this period in spite of the fact that the annual number of femoral neck fractures doubled. Thus, the mean hospitalization time decreased from 44 to 16 days. The proportion of patients admitted from their own homes decreased from 80% to 52% during the 17-year period, and for these, the return rate home at discharge from the hospital increased from 44% to 75%. According to several reports from Scandinavia, the number of hip fractures will double in the next two decades. Ways of further reducing the hospitalization time, new techniques, and, if possible, methods of preventing hip fractures must be sought.\r"

The average follow-up period was 3.8 years with a range of one to ten years. Methods used included analysis of clinical data, roentgenograms, final pain ratings, walking ratings, and activity levels using the UCLA rating system. Pain relief and overall functional results were better than that of most series of acute femoral neck fractures treated with hemiarthroplasty and similar to that of total hip arthroplasty series. The complication rate was slightly less than both authors' elective total hip series, and considerably less than most hemiarthroplasty series. Complications included a superficial wound infection, a urinary tract infection, and a perforated colon diverticulum. Four patients died within one year from causes unrelated to the hip arthroplasty. There were no deep infections, dislocations, or reoperations. Total hip arthroplasty in selective cases of acute femoral neck fractures can give more consistent pain relief and better functional results than hemiarthroplasty, without an increase in complications.\r"

Based upon the results, the insertion of a Leinbach prosthesis is recommended for the elderly patient with a comminuted intertrochanteric fracture. Function is restored within a short period of time and allows unrestricted weight-bearing almost immediately. The hospital stay is shortened. The incidence of secondary operations, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, decubiti, and pneumonia is relatively low.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review was performed on 20 patients treated at the authors' hospital between 1961 and 1981 with noninfected nonunions following primary open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of intertrochanteric femoral fractures. All patients were available for follow-up examination. Each patient was interviewed at an average follow-up period of 6.6 (0.8-11.9) years. The group consisted of 15 women and five men with an average age at the time of fracture of 63 (36-86) years. Only one fracture was \"stable\" while 19 were \"unstable\" with loss of medial support. The initial fixation device was a sliding nail or screw in four patients, fixed nail plate in 11, Smith-Petersen in two, Deyerle pins in one, and was unrecorded in two. Of the 20 cases, it was possible to obtain the original postoperative roentgenograms in 12. Anatomic reduction had been achieved in four, medial displacement osteotomy had been used in two, varus positioning in one, and valgus positioning in five. Subsequent operative treatment for the nonunions consisted of three endoprostheses, six total hip arthroplasties, and 11 repeated attempts at ORIF. Of those treated with repeat ORIF, nine (82%) achieved radiographic union at an average time of six months. Of the remaining two who did not achieve union with the second ORIF, one achieved union following removal of internal fixation and bone grafting (five months) and one required a total hip arthroplasty. The postoperative functional results, as determined by a modified Harris hip score, were improved over the preoperative functional results for each treatment mode. Functional results were best in those patients who achieved union with a second surgical attempt.\r"

  ".W": "The approach to hip fractures in the developing world has been reviewed to give perspective to the problem on a larger scale. Hip fracture treatment in the developing world is a paradigm for treatment of other orthopedic problems as well as for medical care in general. The most successful approach has been to use the resources as sparingly as possible so as to provide care for the greatest number of people. Reliance on simpler, more basic techniques of nonoperative treatment reduces the complication rate and seems to provide a safer, more cost-effective approach, but the nonunion rate may be 30%-70%. The situation in which technical development exceeds resources is not unique to the developing world, although it is perhaps more apparent there because of a lower resource level. The \"developed\" world faces the same dilemma, the only real difference perhaps being a higher minimum. Probably no society today can provide the medical care it is technically capable of producing for all of its members. When viewed from a world-wide scale, the task of providing high-technology medical care seems daunting indeed. Development of more sophisticated, expensive technology may not be the appropriate direction; a more fundamental or preventive approach might in the long run be the most effective.\r"

Nonoperative management still remains a desirable option for truly nonambulatory, demented, aged patients with proximal femoral fracture. Triage should be done in the chronic care institution, but only by professionals who know the individual.\r"

The infants were born between 1976 and 1979, (mean birthweight, 1.2 kg; mean gestational age, 30 weeks). They included three with spastic quadriplegia, 14 with spastic diplegia, and five with hydrocephalus. Eight children were not walking. Seven families rated their child's neurologic problem as severe, while 15 rated the problem as mild. Neurologically abnormal children tended to display more screaming and crying than the normal children. Cost of ongoing medical care was a problem for families of nine neurologically abnormal as compared with two families of normal children. The abnormal children required a total of 61 postneonatal rehospitalizations versus 11 in the normal group. Families of neurologically abnormal children reported on significant major changes in their personal lives for the care of their child. Both groups of parents reported heightened appreciation of their child. Plans for future children were affected in both. Parents identified an urgent need for better medical information, education of pediatricians regarding preterm development and neurologic sequelae, and better contact and support among parents themselves.\r"

The most frequent ophthalmologic diagnoses were lesions of the optic nerve, optic pathway, and visual centers of the brain (cortical blindness). A majority of the infants had multiple handicaps: 17 percent had hearing loss, 48 percent had cerebral palsy, 46 percent had seizures, and 78 percent had severe developmental delay. The high incidence of multiple handicaps and significant medical problems indicates the necessity for interface between physicians and educators who serve the visually impaired infant.\r"

Normative outpatient data for the CDRS have not, however, been established. In this study, 25 apparently well-adjusted children from a pediatric primary care unit were evaluated by the CDRS. Their scores (ranging from 16 to 18) differed significantly from the normal values noted by the founders of the scale, based on the study of inpatients. On the other hand, a study of six of our clinically depressed children indicated scores of 22 to 49.

In contrast, only 24 percent of responding parents continued to be concerned about developmental problems. In more than half of the cases in which parents were no longer concerned, especially about behavior, teachers indicated that there continued to be problems. Age and sex of children were not related to outcome. The higher the socioeconomic status of parents, the more likely the parents were to report persistent developmental problems. Children with persistent problems tended to have difficult temperament characteristics. This study suggests that it is difficult to predict which problems will persist and that there are varying viewpoints as to the nature and existence of these problems.\r"

Ninety-four percent of children medicated for hyperactivity had three or more otitis infections, and 69 percent had greater than 10 infections. In comparison, 50 percent of non-hyperactive school-failure patients had three or more infections and 20 percent had greater than 10 infections.

They also thought that drug use would exacerbate the behavior problem more for the ADD child than for the epileptic child. It is suggested that by being aware of and acknowledging the existence of these attitudes, clinicians can better deal with concerns that parents may have regarding drug treatment for their children, possibly increasing the chances for a successful outcome.\r"

Despite such seemingly apparent signs of possible drug use by these 35 adolescents, a mean time of 12 months elapsed before parents suspected their children of marijuana abuse. In many cases mental health professionals consulted by a number of the children when they were using drugs were likewise unaware of the marijuana abuse.\r"

Baseline systemic vascular resistance and the response to nicardipine for HTN (1968 +/- 657 to 905 +/- 256 dynes X sec X cm-5) and CHF (2002 +/- 988 to 1089 +/- 216 +/- 99 dynes X sec X cm-5) were virtually identical (P less than 0.01). In both groups there was a significant increase of cardiac index in response to afterload reduction: HTN, 2.70 +/- 0.46 to 4.47 +/- 1.01; CHF, 1.90 +/- 0.33 to 2.88 +/- 0.80 L/min/m2 (P less than 0.01), so that a negative inotropic effect was not evident. In HTN the increase in cardiac index was primarily the result of reflex increase of heart rate (67 +/- 16 to 95 +/- 25 bpm [P less than 0.05]), associated with norepinephrine increase from 402 +/- 243 to 744 +/- 364 pg/ml (P less than 0.001). In CHF the cardiac index increase was caused by a stroke volume index increase (23 +/- 4 to 33 +/- 9 ml/min; P less than 0.01), with no significant change in heart rate or norepinephrine. Thus nicardipine, by means of calcium channel antagonism, induced reversal of vasoconstriction. Differences in the cardiac response identify the importance of characterizing the pathophysiologic status of cardiac impairment to more accurately interpret pharmacologic interventions.\r"

Ascorbic acid or a placebo was given to 20 healthy male subjects for 2 weeks before ethanol consumption. The dose of ethanol was 0.95 gm/kg body weight and was consumed during a 2 1/2-hour period. Thirty minutes after ethanol consumption, motor coordination and intellectual function were assessed by Goldberg's \"Finger-Finger\" and \"Serial Sevens\" tests. In addition, color discrimination was measured with the use of the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Color Test. Hourly blood samples were taken for 10 hours after ethanol consumption to measure serum triglyceride levels, blood lactate/pyruvate ratios, and serum enzymes. Blood ethanol clearance was also determined. Ethanol consumption elevated serum triglyceride levels and blood lactate/pyruvate ratios and impaired performance of the behavioral tests but did not alter serum enzyme levels. Ascorbic acid pretreatment resulted in significant enhancement in blood ethanol clearance and an increase in serum triglyceride levels after ethanol consumption in half of the subjects. Ascorbic acid pretreatment also resulted in improved motor coordination and color discrimination after ethanol consumption in half of the subjects. Ascorbic acid pretreatment did not influence elevated blood lactate/pyruvate ratios or impaired intellectual function.\r"

Ibuprofen and flurbiprofen concentrations of about 3 and 0.2 micrograms/ml, respectively, inhibited aggregation during the 5-minute testing period.

  ".W": "Theophylline metabolism was accelerated in 11 of 13 normal male volunteers who received theophylline for 1 week in usual therapeutic doses (3 mg/kg orally t.i.d.). Mean theophylline clearance increased 24% and mean salivary elimination half-life (t1/2) decreased 16%, whereas the mean apparent volume of distribution of theophylline was unchanged at 0.7 L/kg. Large variations occurred in the extent of autoinduction, ranging from no change in two subjects to doubling of theophylline clearance in two others. Subjects who accelerated their theophylline metabolism exhibited a high inverse correlation between the extent of their induction and their two control values for theophylline clearance (r = -0.88 and -0.91; P less than 0.05). A single oral dose of antipyrine (18 mg/kg) simultaneously coadministered with a single oral dose of theophylline (5 mg/kg) retarded the metabolism of both theophylline and antipyrine. No significant change occurred in the apparent volume of distribution of either drug. Coadministration with antipyrine reduced mean theophylline clearance 18% and increased salivary t1/2 39%. Theophylline decreased mean antipyrine clearance 21% and increased its mean salivary t1/2 28%. Theophylline metabolism, therefore, is sensitive to not only autoinduction when theophylline is given long term at usual therapeutic doses but also inhibition when theophylline is coadministered with certain drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Cibenzoline is a new antiarrhythmic agent with predominant Vaughan-Williams type 1 properties. The safety, tolerance, and adverse effects of incremental single intravenous doses of this agent were investigated. A total of 28 patients received incremental doses of 0.25 mg/kg (four patients), 0.5 mg/kg (five patients), 0.75 mg/kg (seven patients), 1.0 mg/kg (six patients), or 1.2 mg/kg (six patients) cibenzoline. Another six patients received 2.0 mg/kg disopyramide. Left ventricular function by radionuclide ventriculography and plasma cibenzoline levels were measured at frequent intervals. In the patients who received 1.0 mg/kg and 1.2 mg/kg cibenzoline or patients who received 2.0 mg/kg disopyramide, right and left ventricular filling pressures and cardiac output were measured with a Swan-Ganz catheter. At low-dose cibenzoline (0.25 to 0.75 mg/kg) there was a modest drop in ejection fraction (60% +/- 7% to 53% +/- 7%). With the higher doses of cibenzoline (1.0 or 1.2 mg/kg) there was a more profound fall in ejection fraction (69% +/- 8% to 49% +/- 8%) that persisted for approximately 2 hours. This was associated with a rise in end diastolic volume index (74 +/- 24 to 85 +/- 27 ml/m2) and end systolic volume index (29 +/- 15 to 43 +/- 18 ml/m2) and a fall in cardiac index (2.65 +/- 0.62 to 2.14 +/- 0.24 L/min/m2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine the kinetics of ribavirin, 17 symptom-free homosexual men with lymphadenopathy were studied. Single doses of ribavirin, 600, 1200, or 2400 mg, were given orally or intravenously. The plasma ribavirin concentration-time profiles were well fitted by a three-compartment open model. Ribavirin followed linear kinetics over the dose range studied. The mean 1-hour postinfusion concentrations after intravenous ribavirin, 600, 1200, and 2400 mg, were 8.0, 19.7, and 37.1 mumol/L, respectively. The mean +/- SD plasma beta-phase half-life, terminal-phase (gamma) half-life, and volume of distribution at steady state were 2.0 +/- 1.1 hours, 35.5 +/- 14.0 hours, and 647 +/- 258 L, respectively. The mean ribavirin renal clearance and total body clearance were 99 +/- 30 and 283 +/- 37 ml/min, respectively. After an oral dose of 600, 1200, and 2400 mg, the mean peak plasma ribavirin concentrations (which occurred 1.5 hours after administration) were 5.1, 9.9, and 12.6 mumol/L, respectively. The mean absorption half-life and bioavailability of ribavirin were 0.5 hour and 45%. Ribavirin had no plasma protein binding and the drug accumulated within red blood cells. In conclusion, ribavirin is incompletely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, its renal excretion accounts for approximately one third of the drug's elimination, and drug accumulation (greater than threefold) will result with repetitive dosing at the 6- to 8-hour dosing interval currently used.\r"

The 155 patient participants received single intramuscular doses of either ketorolac, 10, 30, or 90 mg, or morphine, 6 or 12 mg, administered in a double-blind, randomized fashion. Pain scores (verbal and visual analog) were recorded at baseline and assessed at 30 minutes and then hourly to 6 hours. Pain relief was rated at the same times. Ketorolac, 90 and 30 mg, was rated significantly better than morphine, 6 mg, at each assessment interval after 1 hour. Ketorolac, 90 and 30 mg, was rated similarly to morphine, 12 mg, for the first 3 hours and better than morphine, 12 mg, 4 hours after injection. There were no serious side effects reported. The only side effect reported in more than 3% of patients was 8% somnolence with morphine. This study shows ketorolac to be a safe and effective analgesic for relief of postoperative pain.\r"

Age and gender effects were studied in 32 subjects, divided into young (aged 21 to 29 years) and elderly (aged 60 to 81 years) groups. Compared with young subjects, the elderly had significantly higher peak serum bromazepam concentrations (132 vs. 82 ng/ml), smaller volume of distribution (0.88 vs. 1.44 L/kg), lower oral clearance (0.41 vs. 0.76 ml/min/kg), and increased serum free fraction (34.8% vs. 28.8% unbound). However, gender had no significant influence on bromazepam kinetics. In 11 young female users of oral contraceptive steroids, compared with seven age- and weight-matched control women not using oral contraceptives, no differences in bromazepam kinetics were observed. Coadministration of cimetidine (1.2 gm daily) significantly reduced bromazepam clearance (0.41 vs. 0.82 ml/min/kg) and prolonged elimination half-life (29 vs. 23 hours). Propranolol (160 mg daily) significantly prolonged bromazepam half-life (28 vs. 23 hours), but the reduction in clearance associated with propranolol (0.65 vs. 0.82 ml/min/kg) did not reach significance. Bromazepam has the pharmacokinetic characteristics of benzodiazepines with half-life values between 20 and 30 hours. Consistent with its biotransformation pathway by hepatic microsomal oxidation, bromazepam clearance is significantly impaired in elderly individuals, by coadministration of cimetidine and possibly propranolol.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetic interaction between pentopril (250 mg) and furosemide (40 mg) was studied in 12 normal healthy volunteers after oral administration of each drug alone and in combination. No significant changes in any pharmacokinetic parameters of pentopril or its active metabolite (CGS 13934) were observed on coadministration of furosemide. In contrast, pentopril induced significant changes in disposition of furosemide. Pentopril decreased renal clearance (CLR) of furosemide by 54% and the fraction excreted unchanged in urine also decreased by 55%. However, such decrease in CLR of furosemide was compensated by a simultaneous increase in glucuronidation (by 200%), resulting in a slight increase in systemic clearance (decreased AUC). Systemic bioavailability of furosemide appears to be unchanged in the presence of pentopril (0.46 vs. 0.41). No effect of pentopril on plasma protein binding of furosemide was detected. In spite of the decreased CLR and urinary excretion rate of furosemide, the urinary output (1749 vs. 1774 ml/6 hr) and Na+ excretion (757 vs. 816 mEq/6 hr) remained almost unchanged. These findings suggest that total furosemide (unchanged and glucuronide) might contribute to diuresis and natriuresis rather than the unchanged furosemide alone. Because of unchanged pharmacodynamic effect, such pharmacokinetic interaction may not require any dosage adjustment for furosemide on pentopril coadministration.\r"

  ".W": "The current interest in physical conditioning has resulted, to a large degree, from the desire of many individuals to improve their ability to sustain physical activity without fatigue. To safely participate in a conditioning program, an individual should first learn his initial fitness level. The step test is simple and accurate and is found in many laboratories and physicians' offices. The physical exercise should last long enough to adjust the individual's circulation and respiration to that of the level of exercise, usually three to four minutes. In addition, the work rate should be sufficiently stressful to result in a steady-state heart rate greater than 120 and less than 170 beats per minute. For most untrained adolescents and adults, this intensity of effort can be achieved using a single-stage step test of 16 in and a stepping frequency of 20 to 25 steps per minute. The single-stage step test can be used to assess more fit individuals simply by increasing stepping frequency (raising the height above 16 in is not recommended because of premature leg fatigue in heavy individuals and those of short stature). Multistage step tests are based on the same requirements as those of the single-stage test except that the multistage test provides a gradual increase in work rate and a termination level that often exceeds the exertional level experienced in a single-stage test. The multistage test can be used not only for providing reliable measurements of cardiovascular fitness but also, with the appropriate equipment, for the diagnosis of cardiovascular abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
