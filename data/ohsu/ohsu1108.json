Haplotyping suggests that the mutation in all five breeds has a common origin. Assuming that this is the causal mutation for MH, the development of a noninvasive diagnostic test will provide the basis for elimination of the MH gene or its controlled inclusion in swine breeding programs.\r"

It comprised 28 factors organized into eight categories: job, psychosocial, injury, diagnostic, demographic, medical history, health behaviors, and anthropometric characteristics and was administered as a 15-minute written questionnaire. The model was tested prospectively on 250 patients (age range, 18-65 years) attending two secondary-care low-back clinics. Disability, as predicted by the model, was compared with 1) actual disability assessed 3 and 6 months later; 2) predictions of disability made by the attending physicians; and 3) predictions obtained from an empirically derived model. These results showed that 1) the expert-generated risk model had a predictive accuracy of 89% and did better in predicting disability than the physicians across all samples and 2) the empirically weighted model did best of all (91% predictive accuracy), suggesting that the expert model used appropriate factors but that the weights assigned to these factors by the panel of experts could be improved.\r"

On the basis of a standardized clinical examination, a physician diagnosed sciatica in 5.1% and LBP in 11.6% of the subjects. Those with a previous traumatic back injury had a 2.5-fold risk of having sciatica or LBP. The fractions of sciatica and LBP attributable to such back injuries were estimated to be 16.5% and 13.7%, respectively. Sum indices of both physical and mental stress at work were found to be directly proportional to the prevalence of sciatica and LBP. Smokers had an increased risk of LBP, and body height was related positively to the prevalence of sciatica. These associations, however, were inconsistent between sex and age subgroups. In the presence of osteoarthritis in the knee, hip, or hand, LBP was prevalent (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1-6.9), but sciatica was not (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.7). Diabetics were found to have a significantly decreased prevalence of LBP (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8). Many factors, independent of each other, determine the occurrence of chronic low-back syndromes. The determinants of sciatica and LBP are different to some extent.\r"

Twenty-seven studies had major methodologic flaws including biased test interpretations, faulty cohort assembly, poor clinical descriptions, and small sample size. The only study of reasonably high quality found no discriminant value for liquid-crystal thermography. The role of thermography remains unclear. Rigorous clinical research is required to establish its diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility. Thermography cannot be recommended currently for routine clinical use in evaluating low-back pain.\r"

Discs with a low signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI were characterized by shortening of relaxation times, dehydration, and decreases in total proteoglycan content and chondroitin-keratan sulfate ratios in the nucleus pulposus. This corresponded well with previously published studies. In histologic structure, no obvious differences between MRI findings were found. In conclusion, a low signal intensity in a lumbar disc on T2-weighted MRI probably reflects a true biochemical disc degeneration, but its relation to structural degenerative changes is uncertain. Therefore, MRI seems to be a sensitive and a specific imaging modality for detecting pathologic biochemical disc changes in the spine of a young adult.\r"

Five cadaver spines (18 discs) and 25 patient studies (122 discs) all imaged at 1.5 Tesla were studied. Two signs of early degenerative disc disease were found: infolding and the central dot. Infolding of the central fibers of the outer annulus coalesced into a central dot of low signal intensity that was seen on both the ex vivo and in vivo images. Infolding was seen 29 of 122 times, and the central dot was observed 15 to 122 times on the in vivo images. A later form of degenerative disc disease was identified as a separation of the nucleus pulposus from the hyaline cartilage end-plate. This separation was seen as a linear area of either low or high signal intensity on the ex vivo images but only as a band of high signal intensity on the in vivo spin-echo 2,500-msec/80-msec images. Only 7 of 122 in vivo discs showed this separation. Internal herniation of nucleus pulposus into the outer annulus was seen only on the ex vivo images. Early degenerative disc disease may exist before there is loss of disc height or signal intensity on the long time-to-repetition (TR)/time-to-echo (TE) magnetic resonance images.\r"

  ".W": "Partial discectomy was done in vitro on 15 human lumbar discs from donors 20-40 years of age. The change of disc height, radial disc bulge, and intradiscal pressure was measured in relation to the mass of central disc tissue excised. Disc height decreases and radial disc bulge increases approximately in proportion with the mass of the tissue excised. At the same time, intradiscal pressure decreases. On average, removal of 1 g of disc tissue results in a height decrease of 0.8 mm and a radial bulge increase of 0.2 mm. Removal of 3 g of central disc tissue lowers the intradiscal pressure to approximately 40% of its initial value. A mechanical model is presented which explains the observed relation between the volume of material removed and the subsequent change of height, bulge, and pressure. The experimental results and the model provide insight into the rationale of disc pressurization. A high intradiscal pressure is a prerequisite for the mechanical function of the disc under physiologic conditions.\r"

The equivalent mineral density of human vertebral bodies was correlated highly with the pullout force of Kluger screws (r2 = 0.61, P less than 0.02). A moderate to high correlation existed between density and vertical force (r2 = 0.42 for Kluger screws, r2 = 0.55 for Steffee screws, P less than 0.02). In calf vertebral bodies of higher density (146 +/- 14 mg/cc), the forces were significantly higher than in the human vertebral bodies (P less than 0.05). Human lumbosacral spines were instrumented with three different fixators: Steffee plates, AO fixateur interne, and Kluger fixateur interne. Of five specimens with a mean density of 88 +/- 11 mg/cc, one screw loosened. More than one screw loosened in six specimens with a mean density of 63 +/- 12 mg/cc, and no screw loosened in four specimens with a mean density of 114 +/- 38 mg/cc. Measurement of equivalent mineral density correlates with the fixation strength of the intrapedicular screws in vitro and should be considered in patients with signs of osteopenia before using pedicular screws for spinal fusions. It is also concluded that calf spines are a good model for testing implants because they tend to focus failure processes in the implant rather than in the implant-bone interface.\r"

In this study, positive fiber immunoreactivity was taken as an indication that those fibers were of sensory, and not sympathetic, origin. Immunoreactivity was found in the outer annulus fibrosus of all intervertebral discs studied. The CGRP-like immunoreactivity was also found in structures that resembled nerve endings.

Before abnormal spinal morphometry can be determined, it is first necessary to establish normal values for the specific patient population being evaluated. Several studies have attempted to establish norms for plain film measurements of the cervical spine in children and adults, but few have applied consistent methods for generating precise measurements. The first part of this study established normal values for cervical spinal morphometry and segmental spinal motion in the elite athlete. The second part of this study determined the most accurate screening method for detecting cervical spinal stenosis. Three sagittal diameters of the cervical spinal canal were compared to determine which represented the smallest midline diameter on static and dynamic radiographs. The Torg ratio was also evaluated as a method to detect significant cervical spinal stenosis and was shown to have a high sensitivity but poor positive predictive value. The study clarified why the ratio yields a large number of false positive cases. From the results of this study, an algorithm has been developed for the evaluation of stenosis of the cervical spine in athletes.\r"

After an initial anterior and posterior destabilizing lesion was created at the L5-L6 vertebral levels in 63 adult beagles, various spinal reconstructive surgical procedures were performed--with or without bilateral posterolateral bone grafting, with or without bilateral oophorectomies, and with or without spinal instrumentation (Harrington distraction, Luque rectangular, Cotrel-Dubousset pedicular, or Steffee pedicular implants). Observation 6 months after surgery revealed a significantly improved probability of achieving a spinal fusion if spinal instrumentation had been used (X2 = 5.84, P = .016). Nondestructive mechanical testing after removal of all metal instrumentation in torsion, axial compression, and flexion revealed that the fusions performed in conjunction with spinal instrumentation were more rigid (P less than .05). Quantitative histomorphometry showed that the volumetric density of bone was significantly lower (ie, device-related osteoporosis occurred) for fused versus unfused spines. In addition, a linear correlation occurred between decreasing volumetric density of bone and increasing rigidity of the spinal implant (r = .778); ie, device-related osteoporosis occurred secondary to Harrington, Cotrel-Dubousset, and Steffee pedicular instrumentation. Oophorectomized dogs became more osteoporotic than their surgically matched controls (posterolateral bone grafting alone, Cotrel-Dubousset pedicular instrumentation, and Steffee pedicular instrumentation); device-related osteoporosis added to the degree of hormonally induced osteoporosis (t = 5.0, P less than .0001). This is the first study to date documenting the occurrence of stress shielding in the spine secondary to spinal instrumentation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of the present study was 1) to investigate the relationship between commonly used measurements of depression and pain perception; and 2) to examine the utility of differentiating between somatic signs and cognitive/affective symptoms of depression in patients with chronic low-back pain. The Beck Depression Inventory and the Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression were divided into cognitive/affective and somatic subscales. These measures, as well as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, were administered to 111 patients with chronic low-back pain. Analyses revealed significant correlations between depression scores and self-reported pain intensity. The cognitive/affective subscale of the Beck Depression Inventory resulted in the only nonsignificant correlation with pain intensity. These findings suggest that commonly used measurements of depression are confounded with pain symptomatology and that the cognitive/affective category of the Beck Depression Inventory may prove to be a more accurate measurement of depression in patients with chronic low-back pain.\r"

The study included 164 consecutive patients who underwent evaluation with discography and magnetic resonance imaging for lumbar disc disease from August 1987 to September 1989. Chronic low-back pain, with or without radicular symptoms, was the presenting complaint in each case. Each patient had previously failed conservative treatment. The average age was 36 (range, 19-66 years). Magnetic resonance images were performed before discography in each case. Discography was performed with patients minimally sedated and under local anesthesia. A lateral approach was used. Magnetic resonance imaging and discography correlated in 90 cases (55%) and differed in 74 (45%). Considering disc levels, discography and magnetic resonance imaging correlated in 371 discs (80%). There were 172 normal discs and 199 abnormal discs. Of the abnormal discs, 151 (76%) reproduced symptoms. In 60 discs (13%), magnetic resonance images showed abnormal findings and the discogram normal findings. Discs levels classified as abnormal on magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that 108 discs (37%) were asymptomatic. Magnetic resonance imaging showed normal findings and the discogram abnormal findings in 34 discs (7%), of which 21 (5%) recreated exact symptoms and 13 (2%) caused no pain. Magnetic resonance imaging is a static test and discography the only available dynamic test for disc evaluation. Awake discography is a diagnostic study that can determine which abnormal discs are symptomatic via the pain response.\r"

Five-level noncontiguous laminectomies were performed on six adult canines. The most caudal (Site 1) was left uncovered and served as the control. Exposed dura at each of the remaining four levels was covered with one of the following: Site 2, free autogenous laminar bone graft; Site 3, polymethylmethacrylate; Site 4, Teflon-Proplast composite; Site 5, collagen gel. The dogs used in the study were killed 16 weeks after surgery. Three specimens were examined by plain roentgenography and computerized tomography, two specimens were examined histologically, and the remaining four specimens were graded according to scar volume and scar adherence, as detected during gross dissection of the postlaminectomy scar. No repair technique interfered with roentgenography evaluation. The least scar and fewest adhesions were present under the free bone graft repair site. The Teflon-Proplast composite and polymethylmethacrylate both limited the amount and adherence of scar. Collagen gel and control sites were indistinguishable in this study. It is concluded that lamina repair with a solid material covering exposed dura significantly reduces the formation of postlaminectomy membrane and scar.\r"

In the fracture group, more than one half of the bone immediately above the flare of the inferior articular process at the level of the laminectomy, measured in a medial to lateral direction, had been resected. No one in the control group had more than one quarter of this bone removed (P = .0001). Lumbar facet fractures may be one cause of late postlaminectomy pain.

The pain experienced by patients with osteoarthritis of large joints has been associated with intraosseous abnormalities of elevated pressure, venous dilatations, and abnormalities of pH, pCO2, and pO2. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates an abnormal signal in the vertebral bodies of some patients with degenerative disc disease. The intraosseous pressure as well as the intraosseous pH, pO2, and pCO2 in a group of patients undergoing anterior spine surgery was studied, and the results were correlated to the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging appearance. Vertebral bodies with an abnormal magnetic resonance imaging signal had pressures 55% higher than vertebral bodies with a homogeneous signal; they also had significantly decreased pH and increased pCO2. Bodies with Type I changes had pressures 73% higher than those with a normal signal. No differences in pO2 were identified. These findings suggest that abnormalities of intraosseous pressure or blood gas concentrations may be related to mechanisms of pain production in some patients with back pain. These abnormalities can be identified by magnetic resonance imaging. Further investigation is needed to determine if therapeutic manipulation of these variables can be effective in relieving axial spinal pain.\r"

A number of methods are known by which a lifter can reduce the load on the spine during lifting. This study explores an additional method: rotation of the load before it is actually lifted off the ground. The hypothesis tested is that when a lifter lifts a box, he or she rotates it before it leaves the floor. By the use of an optoelectronic system to study weight box rotation, it was established that rotation occurs in every lift before the actual lift occurs. Rotation time increased with increasing load, indicating that the rotation technique is more important when load reduction is most critical.\r"

In addition, synthetic disc prostheses with the same specifications of geometry and material properties were manufactured. The developed model was found to be reliable and accurate when finite-element analysis results were compared with experimental synthetic disc data. The model also matched the mechanical behavior of the natural disc.

Spinal fusion is a method for the treatment of chronic, disabling low-back pain that does not respond to nonoperative treatments. Spinal fusion, however, has various adverse effects, and the results of spinal fusion are often unpredictable. The goal of this research project was to develop disc prostheses that have mechanical properties very similar to those of natural, normal discs. Two types of disc prosthesis, one with fiber-reinforced polyurethane and the other with multicomponent, non-fiber-reinforced polymers (C-Flex), have been designed and manufactured. The fiber-reinforced disc was made of polyurethane end-plates with A100 hardness, a homogenous nucleus with A40, and 12 layers of multidirectional (0, +45 degrees), fiber-reinforced anulus with A40 polyurethane. The design and modeling of the multicomponent polymers (non-fiber-reinforced) was made of C-Flex endplates with A90 hardness, a nucleus with A35 occupying 35% of the volume, and an anulus with 70A. Mechanical testing of these disc prostheses demonstrated similar mechanical properties to those of natural, normal discs.\r"

The preoperative radiologic assessment (plain roentgenographs, polytomography, bending films, and computed tomographic scans) were correlated with surgical findings. This study indicated a significant percentage of inaccuracy of all radiologic modalities used. Noncorrelations were present in 36% of plain roentgenographs, 41% of polytomograms, 38% of bending films, and 43% of computed tomographic scans. Radiologic inaccuracy was manifest on both the positive and negative sides. Computed tomographic scanning presented the lowest percentage of inaccuracy (22%) and bending films the highest percentage (27%).

  ".W": "Various systems of supplementing bone grafts with internal fixation in the lumbosacral spine have been used in an effort to improve fusion rates. This study reports biomechanical data of cyclic loading cadaveric spines instrumented with translaminar facet screws as well as early clinical results on this technique. Static loading tests comparing uninstrumented and instrumented spinal motion units show that a ninefold increase in flexion load is necessary for constant displacement after facet screw fixation. Repetitive loading tests show only a small decrease in stiffness of instrumented segments even after 5,000 cycles. To date, 35 patients have undergone fusion by this technique as performed by one surgeon. After excluding Workers' Compensation cases and cases with less than 2 years follow-up, there were 18 cases available for review. Twelve of these 18 cases were two-level fusions. Ten patients underwent concomitant discectomy or nerve root decompression. There were no cases of iatrogenic neurologic injury or pseudoarthrosis. It is concluded that translaminar facet screws have a sound biomechanical basis and are a valuable addition to lumbar fusion procedures.\r"

The vertebrae were grouped by adjacent levels and matched for bone mineral density (g/cm2), which was measured by dual-photon absorptiometry. Triangulation of Steffee screws and CD pedicle screws was accomplished by transverse plates specifically designed to increase fixation within the same vertebra before the longitudinal Steffee plate or CD rod was applied. A transverse plate with adjustable length was also tested to accommodate variable interpedicular distances. Comparative pullout load-to-failures were as follows: laminar hook, 809 SE 99.4 N; single CD pedicular screws, 863 SE 108 N; single Steffee pedicular screw, 1245 SE 75.3 N; adjustable transverse plate, 1341 SE 114; triangulated Steffee pedicle screws with a transverse plate, 1701 SE 151 N; and triangulated CD pedicle screws with a transverse plate, 2096 SE 115 N. Three triangulated constructs with pedicle screws and a transverse plate (CD, Steffee, and Kirschner) provided significantly greater fixation than conventional pedicular or laminar hook based instrumentation systems (P less than 0.05). Improved treatment of spinal deformities in the elderly and osteoporotic population is dependent on improving the fixation at the metal-bone interface of spinal implants Particularly in osteoporotic vertebrae, the strength of fixation of two triangulated pedicle screws is better than either laminar hooks or single pedicle screws. The strength of fixation of triangulated pedicle screws connected by a transverse plate is superior to a single pedicle screw because it is dependent on the mass of bone between the screws rather than simply the amount of bone within the screw thread.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The cage-like implant has ridges or teeth to resist pullout or retropulsion, struts to support weight bearing, and a hollow center for packing of autologous bone graft. Because carbon is radiolucent, bony healing can be imaged by standard radiographic techniques. The device has been mechanically tested in cadaver spines and compared with posterior lumbar interbody fusion performed with donor bone. The carbon device required a pullout force of 353 N compared with 126 N for donor bone. In compression testing, posterior lumbar interbody fusion performed with the carbon device bore a load of 5,288 N before failure of the vertebral bone. Posterior lumbar interbody fusion performed with donor bone failed at 4,628 N, and unmodified motion segments failed at 6,043 N. The carbon fiber implant separates the mechanical and biologic functions of posterior lumbar interbody fusion.\r"

After the position of the L5 root, sacral roots, and iliac vessels, was considered, safe posterior sacral screw implantation could be assured through placement above the level of the first sacral foramen directed medially toward the promontory, parallel to the superior sacral end-plate. Complications of indiscriminate screw placement included L5-root damage, iliac vein penetration, and intractable perineal pain due to sacral root injury. Preoperative computed tomography with the scanner gantry tilted to parallel the superior sacral end-plate defined the great vessels, neural foramens, inclination of the superior sacral end-plate, and prominence of the posterior ileum. Surgical accuracy was evaluated after surgery with computed tomography.\r"

Recommended locations and techniques for screw placement vary, particularly when bicortical purchase of the sacrum is performed. The purpose of this study was to describe the critical anatomy and potential injuries to neurovascular and visceral structures anterior to the sacrum. Lack of awareness can lead to life-threatening complications. The study included 22 fresh human cadavers with no prior spinal surgery. Specimens were placed in a prone position, and the lumbosacral spine was exposed. Two 6.5-mm screws were inserted using one of two techniques, respectively: Starting just inferior to the S1 facet one screw was angled 25 degrees caudally and 30 degrees laterally; in the second technique, lateral inclination was increased to 45 degrees. In addition, all specimens had screws placed in the S2 pedicles. An anterior dissection was performed to allow evaluation of the neurovascular and visceral structures at risk for injury by, or adjacent to, the screw tips. All significant neurovascular structures in the area of concern were constant in position. The internal iliac vein and the lumbosacral nerve trunk were most at risk for injury by the 30 and 45 degrees laterally directed screws. The sigmoid colon, though close to the S2 screw, was protected by its mesentery. Screws placed in the S1 pedicle were least likely to injure the neurovascular bundle. A lateral and a midline safe zone were identified.\r"

However, in patients with a \"far-out syndrome\" requiring decompression or in cases where unilateral posterior element resection is necessary for any reason, it may be both necessary and indicated. This unilateral destabilization effectively removes one leg of the tripod, rendering that intervertebral joint potentially unstable. The charts and radiographs of 13 patients (seven men, six women) with an average age of 60 years (range, 25 to 76) who underwent unilateral fusion were retrospectively reviewed. Follow-up time ranged from 12 1/2 to 2 years with a median follow-up of 8 years. Eleven of the fusions were at one level, and two were at two levels. Seven patients had a far-out syndrome secondary to degenerative scoliosis; four were secondary to spondylolisthesis. Two patients had an osteoid osteoma involving a pedicle. A paraspinal approach was used in the majority of patients. Autologous bone graft was used in all patients. Unilateral pedicle screw fixation was used in the last patient in the series. The fusion rate was 85% (11/13). Three patients were smokers, two of whom developed pseudarthrosis. Disc space height did not appear to affect fusion rate. There was no progression of slip noted in any of the patients. One complication was noted in this group: a moderate postoperative infection, which cleared spontaneously.\r"

These were applied in five different positions: between the anterior vertebral bodies, posterior vertebral bodies, pedicles, transverse processes, and lamina. Rotational displacement was limited the most by transfixation between the vertebral bodies (position one or two). Disrupting the anulus fibrosus significantly increased rotation in all positions except those in the vertebral body. These findings may imply that spinal fixation devices that engage the vertebral bodies may offer inherent advantages over purely posterior devices in stabilizing a vertebral motion segment. In addition, an interbody arthrodesis may prevent intervertebral motion better than a posterior or posterolateral fusion.\r"

All the inotropes should be administered for a predetermined effect. If this response is not realized, the inotrope should be discontinued. The indiscriminate use of these powerful but dangerous drugs should be discouraged. However, in periods of decreasing oxygen delivery and consumption, these agents improve tissue oxygenation and prevent the development of isolated or multiple organ dysfunction.\r"

Thoracic electrical bioimpedance is an appealing alternative because of its simplicity, noninvasiveness, and ability to track physiologic trends, but there have been a number of warnings against relying on it exclusively, at least until it is further developed. Doppler ultrasound appears to be a valid method in skilled hands, but its accuracy in quantitating cardiac output, especially in the critically ill, remains questionable. Mixed venous oximetry and transcutaneous oxygen monitoring are promising but are still being evaluated.\r"

  ".U": "91320297\r", 
  ".W": "Antibiotics have dramatically changed the care of the critically ill patient over the last 60 years. Patients with complex physiological conditions present with infectious processes requiring the effective use of antimicrobial drugs. In many situations, the inability to eradicate the infectious process is complicated by the progressive development of resistance among the causative organisms. Systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is warranted only for the prevention of wound infections. Regimens in these cases should use large doses of nontoxic antibiotics covering the spectrum of organisms likely to contaminate the wound. The duration of wound prophylaxis should be short, essentially covering only the period of active wound closure; this is usually less than 24 hours. Prevention of most other infections in the ICU depends on the recognition and correction of the various disturbances of host defenses. Topical antibiotic therapy may reduce the level of colonization for a few specific types of infection. Initial empiric antibiotic therapy should be started for clear indications. The antibiotics chosen should be those most likely to be effective against the probable organisms, those which have the lowest toxicity, and those with the smallest likelihood of inducing multiresistance. They must be adjusted promptly based on the microbiologic sensitivities observed. The realization that the physiology of critical illness may alter the normal relations between drug dosages and the tissue antibiotic levels obtained mandates a different approach to the treatment of these patients. The drug volumes of distribution are generally markedly expanded in these patients. Furthermore, these patients require high tissue antibiotic concentrations to improve the chances for successful therapy. Thus, the antibiotics selected must be capable of providing these levels without significant toxicity to the host. Therapy should be continued based on the clinical response observed. Premature cessation of effective therapy often results in relapse.\r"

The cases were identified on the basis of ultrastructural evidence for basophil/mast cell differentiation of the blasts with little or no differentiation into other lineages. Ultrastructural analysis revealed immature basophil granules in blasts in all eight cases and theta granules in blasts in four cases. In three cases, ultrastructural evidence of mast cell differentiation also was present, with rare cells showing evidence for both basophil and mast cell differentiation. No clinical features distinguished this group of patients from others with acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetically, the cases were heterogeneous. Three had a Philadelphia chromosome; none had a t(6;9). The authors conclude that ultrastructural analysis usually must be used to diagnose acute basophilic leukemia, that acute basophilic leukemia is associated frequently with the Philadelphia chromosome, and that the ultrastructural findings provide evidence for a common origin of basophils and mast cells.\r"

  ".W": "Ten cases of pediatric fulminant hemophagocytic syndrome, encountered between 1986 and 1989, are described. They occurred in the summer, and the patients presented with fever, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, coagulopathy, and abnormal liver function. Bone marrow studies revealed infiltration by atypical T-lymphoid cells, rare B immunoblasts, and mature histiocytes with hemophagocytosis. Initially, histiocytic medullary reticulosis was suspected in six cases. The clinical course was characterized by rapid deterioration, with a mean period of 16 days from onset of fever to death. The main causes of death were coagulopathy with multiple organ failure and opportunistic infection. In seven of eight cases studied by serologic assay and Southern blot hybridization, acute or active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was documented. It is suggested that an atypical or fulminant form of primary EBV infection distinct from classic infectious mononucleosis was prevalent in previously healthy children in Taiwan. Younger age involvement and seasonal clustering were characteristic of the disorder described.\r"

Sixteen cases were of B-cell type (IBLC-B) and 18 cases were of T-cell type (IBLC-T). There were no significant differences in the morphologic characteristics of the neoplastic cells in the two types, although IBLC-B was less likely to be polymorphic than IBLC-T. Interfollicular proliferation, a higher mitotic rate, infiltration by eosinophils, and an increase in capillary-sized blood vessels were also features of IBLC-T, whereas necrosis and fibrosis were more extensive in IBLC-B. Patients with IBLC-B were predominantly female, whereas those with IBLC-T were predominantly male. The mean age was 62 years for those with IBLC-B and 46 years for those with IBLC-T. Patients with IBLC-B usually had lower-stage disease, but there was no significant difference in survival rate between those with IBLC-B and those with IBLC-T. Although most cases of IBLC have been considered to be of peripheral T-cell origin, the authors conclude that IBLC-B is more common than previously considered and that clear-cell morphologic characteristics are not a reliable indicator of T-cell type.\r"

There were seven men and two women, with a mean age of 64 years (range, 9-89 years) and median age of 56 years. Three tumors were limited to the nasal cavity, and the other six had multiple sites of involvement, including the nasal cavity (five), antrum (six), ethmoid (two), orbit (two), and hard palate (one). Histologically, one was a lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL), one was small cleaved-cell lymphoma (SCCL), three were mixed-cell lymphomas (MCLs), and four were large cell lymphomas (LCLs). Four cases were T-cell lymphomas (one SCCL, three MCLs), four were B-cell neoplasms (four LCLs), and one was of uncertain lineage (LBL). Angioinvasion, coagulative necrosis, and epitheliotropism were seen in the T-cell lymphomas. Extranasal dissemination was seen in four cases: one LBL that involved the lymph nodes, skin, and testes 15 months after diagnosis; one B-LCL that involved the skin 9 months after diagnosis; and one B-LCL and one T-MCL that involved the gastric mucosa and lung simultaneously with nasal presentation. This study shows a higher predominance of B-cell lymphomas in the sinonasal region than previously reported in Oriental populations. However, the T:B ratio of these lymphomas is still greater than that observed for primary lymph node-based neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "Of 14 patients who underwent allogeneic or syngeneic bone marrow transplantation, 6 had a transient appearance of small blastoid cells in the bone marrow after transplantation. Most of these patients (11) had leukemia, although 3 had severe aplastic anemia. The cells were 8-18 micron in diameter and had scant cytoplasm and dense nuclei with smooth, homogeneous chromatin. They often had distinct nuclear clefts. These cells constituted 4.0-21.3% of the total number of bone marrow cells. They were not reactive with peroxidase, alpha-naphtyl butylate esterase, naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase, or periodic acid-Schiff stains. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the small blastoid cells expressed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, Ia-like, CD19, and CD10 antigens and cytoplasmic mu heavy chains, indicating a precursor B-cell phenotype. CD20 antigen was not expressed on these cells. The data suggest that cytoplasmic mu may be expressed earlier than CD20 antigen in the differentiation of B-cell lineage. The morphologic, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic characteristics did not distinguish these nonneoplastic cells distinctly from leukemic lymphoblastic cells. The increase of small blastoid cells was a transient and self-limited phenomenon, in contrast to that of neoplastic blasts. These cells should be recognized as a common component of the bone marrow of marrow transplant recipients. The significance and role of these cells in immune recovery and hematopoiesis remain uncertain.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphoepithelioma of the nasopharynx is an undifferentiated carcinoma with prominent lymphoid infiltration. Histologically similar tumors have been documented in the skin, lung, thymus, salivary gland, tonsil, and uterine cervix. The authors report three cases of gastric carcinoma that were histologically and immunohistochemically similar to lymphoepithelioma. The patients were elderly white persons (61, 76, and 77 years of age); two of them had previous partial gastric resections for benign ulcer disease. The tumors were located on the lesser gastric curvature (two cases) and at a previous anastomotic site (one case) and measured 3, 4, and 7 cm in largest dimension. Grossly, each neoplasm was a raised plaque-like lesion with a central ulcer. Microscopically, all three tumors were similar, with poorly differentiated polygonal tumor cells scattered throughout a dense lymphocytic background. In a few areas, tumor cells formed ill-defined cords. In two cases, the neoplasms invaded the gastric muscle layer but had a well-delineated (pushing) margin. The tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for AE3-defined keratin, confirming their epithelial nature. The lymphocytes were a mixture of UCHL-1-positive T cells and L-26-positive B cells. Portions of the Epstein-Barr virus genome were present in all cases, as detected by the polymerase chain reaction. The morphologic features of these cases are similar to those of lymphoepithelioma in other anatomic sites, and these tumors represent a unique subtype of gastric carcinoma.\r"

Thin strips are cut from the tissue in the \"storage cassettes\" and combined by dripping liquid paraffin onto them while they are rolled between the thumbs and forefingers, somewhat like making a cigarette. This results in a tissue \"log.\" Transverse sections of the \"log\" are embedded in paraffin blocks and used as MTSBs. Practical uses of MTSBs are discussed, and their role in quality assurance is stressed.\r"

To evaluate whether the same method may be useful diagnostically in distinguishing gynecomastia from breast cancer in men, a retrospective avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase assay study was performed on 50 cases of gynecomastia and 30 cases of breast carcinoma in men, using a panel of five MoAbs known to recognize different BTAAs. The results of this study demonstrated that MoAbs B1.1, HMFG2, and MBr1 displayed a strong reactivity with gynecomastia and carcinoma, but MoAbs B72.3 and B6.2 separated benign and malignant lesions in a high percentage of cases. When used in combination, the latter two reagents reacted with 96% of the carcinomas that were analyzed but labeled only 67% of gynecomastia cases. Thus, the conjoint use of these two reagents may enhance the use of FNA biopsy as a valuable tool in the presurgical diagnosis of breast nodules in men.\r"

  ".W": "The ability to establish a prognosis for patients with early breast cancer is an important clinical issue. Recent studies have shown that antibodies to haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr) may be useful in stratifying early patients with breast cancer according to their relative risks of recurrence. Nearly 30% of early breast cancers express proteins bearing Hpr epitopes. Hpr-positive breast cancers are more likely to recur after primary resection and are associated with shorter disease-free intervals. This immunohistochemical study examines temporal changes in Hpr expression during the course of disease in 48 patients with fatal breast carcinoma. Thirty-seven primary tumors (77%) were Hpr positive. Ten of the 11 initially negative tumors (91%) were Hpr positive at the time of recurrence. In contrast, only 10 of the 37 initially positive tumors (27%) were Hpr negative with relapse. Of 18 axillary nodes that were examined, 16 (89%) were Hpr positive; all four lymph nodal metastases in patients with initially negative primary tumors were Hpr positive. The authors conclude that the acquisition of Hpr expression parallels increased malignant potential and that Hpr expression, once acquired, tends to remain a permanent characteristic of any given mammary tumor.\r"

Positive membrane staining, which correlates with gene amplification, was found in 15 of 19 cases (79%) of mammary Paget's disease, 4 of 13 cases (31%) of vulvar Paget's disease, none of 8 cases of scrotal Paget's disease, and none of 5 cases of perianal Paget's disease. Of the 19 patients with mammary Paget's disease, specimens of underlying breast tissue were available from 14; all contained a concurrent ductal adenocarcinoma. Concordance of c-erbB-2 antigen staining between the underlying breast carcinoma and the pagetoid component was observed in 12 cases. Of the 13 patients with vulvar Paget's disease, 2 had superficial stromal invasion, and 3 had underlying, deeply invasive adenocarcinomas. One superficially invasive case was positive for c-erbB-2 expression. One additional case of vulvar Paget's disease had an associated primary pagetoid endocervical adenocarcinoma that spread into the endometrium; both the endocervical and vulvar components stained positively for the c-erbB-2 antigen. The results of this study indicate that the c-erbB-2 oncoprotein may play a role in the pathogenesis of extramammary Paget's disease. These results also suggest that the c-erbB-2 oncoprotein may function in vivo to promote intraepithelial spread of adenocarcinoma cells.\r"

GD2 was expressed in all of 28 neuroblastomas and was most abundant in stroma-poor tumors. In differentiating stroma-rich neuroblastomas, neuroblastic clusters, neurofibrils, and most ganglion-like cells were positive, whereas Schwann's-cell stroma did not express GD2. In ganglioneuromas, only a few ganglion-like cells showed GD2, whereas all other structures were negative. Scattered foci of ganglioside GD2 also were found in some non-neuronal tumors, such as rhabdomyosarcomas and osteosarcomas, but not in lymphomas, Askin tumors, or most Wilms' tumors. The monoclonal antibody 3A7 is a useful aid in the immunohistochemical diagnosis of neuroblastoma. In addition, the intense cell surface staining of neuroblastoma cells by this reagent makes it potentially useful for detecting residual neuroblastoma in bone marrow samples and lymph node biopsies.\r"

The lesion was partially removed by transurethral resection (TURP). The patient's symptoms recurred, so he required another TURP four months later; at latest follow-up (four years later), there waas no evidence of disease. Light microscopy revealed a myxoid lesion characterized by an atypical fibroblastic proliferation associated with a prominent inflammatory component and granulation tissue-type vasculature. The lesion nearly replaced the prostatic parenchyma and invaded the bladder wall. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy showed a predominance of fibroblasts with occasional myofibroblasts. DNA flow cytometric analysis showed that the tumor cells had a diploid DNA content. Given these findings and the indolent clinical course, the authors think that this lesion represents a benign, reactive process consistent with a pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor, a recently described rare lesion of the genitourinary tract.\r"

  ".U": "91320913\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred morbidly obese patients who had gastric bypass surgery were studied to determine how various demographic and medical variables affected complication rates, weight loss, and reduction in comorbidities associated with obesity. During the follow-up period (range: 12 to 59 months), 42 patients developed at least 1 complication. Twenty-three patients developed postoperative medical complications, 9 developed psychiatric complications, and 24 developed complications related to food ingestion. No significant relationships were observed between outcome and age, sex, age of obesity onset, or associated medical disorders. Striking differences in outcome were noted, however, when patients were contrasted according to their preoperative insurance status. Patients dependent on medical assistance, social security disability, or workman's compensation (publicly funded group) (n = 40) developed significantly more medical and psychiatric complications than did those (n = 60) who had private medical insurance (p less than 0.02). Despite the higher complication rate, both groups had the same average weight loss (44.9 +/- 15.3 kg for the publicly funded group versus 43.1 +/- 12.9 kg for those with private insurance) and similar reductions in percent excess weight (66.0 +/- 18.4% versus 75.7 +/- 23.0%) during the first postoperative year. All patients also had similar reductions in medication requirements for hypertension, diabetes, and degenerative joint disease. Additionally, 45% of the publicly funded insurance group who either received public welfare (n = 26) or disability benefits (n = 14) preoperatively were able to attain either full-time or part-time employment postoperatively which allowed them to decrease their level of support (58% and 21%, respectively). Forty-six percent of women in the private insurance group who were not working outside the home also began part-time or full-time employment postoperatively. All patients who were working preoperatively continued to work. These data suggest that although the risks associated with gastric bypass surgery are greater in patients dependent on public funding, these patients benefit significantly from the surgery.\r"

The second was whether the activity of this putative collagenase is greater in aneurysmal tissue. No collagenase could be extracted from the wall of the aorta under nondenaturing conditions. However, hydroxyproline was liberated from tissue samples allowed to autolyze at neutral pH under reaction conditions favoring the activity of collagenase. Such an activity was probably enzymic as it occurred in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion and was suppressed by chelators. In normal and stenotic tissue, activity was increased by adding aminophenylmercuric acetate, an activator of latent collagenase. Examination of the blanks revealed that the collagen of aneurysmal aorta was more soluble than normal. Furthermore, its digestion kinetics differed in a way that suggested that aneurysmal aorta possessed a labile component that was absent from normal tissue. Although the activity of the putative aortic collagenase was higher than normal in the aneurysmal tissue, our assays do not distinguish between changes in the amount or activity of the enzyme and alterations in the collagen.\r"

Patients who developed infection after elective laparotomy had a significantly lower mean percentage of monocytes expressing HLA-DR antigen and a lower mean fluorescent intensity than uninfected patients (p less than 0.05). Severely infected nonsurgical patients had significantly lower values than normal volunteers (p less than 0.01), and the mean fluorescent intensity of those who died from infection was significantly lower than that of those who survived (p less than 0.05). Patients on immunosuppressive regimens after renal transplantation had levels of HLA-DR expression similar to those of the volunteers. Monocyte HLA-DR expression was found to be a reliable marker of clinical infection and showed remarkable reproducibility within the normal uninfected study population.\r"

Noninvasive tests have differing sensitivity and specificity, are technically demanding, and may be subject to variability in interpretation. Light reflection rheography (LRR) is a noninvasive method utilizing light-emitting diodes and a sensor to measure light reflected from the skin surface. The intensity of reflected light establishes a graphic pattern that indirectly quantifies parameters of venous function by measuring changes in the microcirculation. Seventy-two patients who underwent contrast venography at our institution were also evaluated with LRR. Twenty-four patients were found to have DVT as demonstrated by venography. Of these, 23 also had DVT detected by LRR. No evidence of thrombus was seen in 45 patients studied by venography; in this group, 35 had normal venous emptying indicated by LRR. Using LRR, a sensitivity of 96% was achieved in the evaluation of clinically suspected DVT. This sensitivity is comparable with other noninvasive tests. In addition, LRR is easy to operate, portable, inexpensive, and not technically demanding. Further investigation is needed to confirm these data and further define the role of LRR in the evaluation of clinically suspected DVT.\r"

Light reflection rheography, which is a reflection of venous pressure changes in the extremity as recorded from the subdermal capillary plexus, was used to correctly diagnose axillary or subclavian venous thrombosis in 11 patients. A positive study was confirmed by phlebography in each instance. There were no instances of false-positive results. The methodology is simple, involving testing of the venous outflow from the upper extremity in response to exercise, application of venous congesting pressure, and measurement of the rate of venous outflow when the congesting pressure is released. Normal respiratory variations of an open venous system are also assessed by this noninvasive modality. The tracing obtained is easy to interpret and provides objective evidence of proximal venous occlusion. The test is not operator-dependent and the instrumentation is relatively inexpensive. We believe that light reflection rheography may be an exciting development in the noninvasive diagnosis of axillary or subclavian venous compromise and merits further trials.\r"

The treatment of these patients has proved problematic. In an attempt at determining the pathophysiology of this subgroup, we investigated the esophageal transit, using the radiolabeled solid bolus esophageal egg transit technique, in 58 such patients: 25 males, 33 females, mean age 39.5 years (range: 13 to 65 years). The egg transit was normal in 31 (53.4%) patients. In the remaining 27 (46.6%) patients, the condensed image analysis showed the following specific abnormal transit patterns: \"step\" delay pattern, demonstrating segmental hold-up in mid- or distal esophagus in 16 (59.3%); nonspecific delay in 6 (22.2%); oscillatory pattern in 3 (11.1%); and total nonclearance during the study period (4 minutes) in 2 (7.4%) patients. The patients with abnormal transit patterns had demographic parameters and symptom scores similar to those found in patients with normal transit. This study shows that almost 50% of patients with reflux symptoms and negative pH and endoscopy have abnormal esophageal transit, and almost two thirds of these patients display segmental transit delay in the lower half of the esophagus. The effect on symptomatology by prokinetic agents in the patient subgroup needs evaluation.\r"

  ".U": "91320919\r", 
  ".W": "The propensity for renal failure associated with obstructive jaundice and liver disease may be related to enhanced vasoconstriction of the renal vascular bed with resultant decreases in renal blood flow. Renal sympathetic nervous activity may be a mediator of this effect. The increased renal production of prostaglandins which has been observed in previous models of bile duct ligation may serve to counterbalance the effects of such vasoconstricting influences. This study was undertaken to assess the effect of bile duct ligation on renal function and prostaglandin production in the rat. Furthermore, this study was designed to determine if renal sympathetic nerve activity contributes to the development of renal failure after bile duct ligation. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent either sham operation (n = 8), bilateral renal denervation (n = 10), bile duct ligation alone (n = 11), or bile duct ligation and bilateral renal denervation (n = 10). Renal function was assessed before and 4 days after operation. Bile duct ligation resulted in a 46% decrease in creatinine clearance (p less than 0.01), a 33% decrease in urinary sodium excretion (p less than 0.01), a twofold increase in urine flow (p less than 0.01), and twofold increases in urinary excretion of PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and thromboxane B2 (p less than 0.01). Renal denervation did not prevent the decreases in creatinine clearance and sodium excretion seen after bile duct ligation and had no effect on the changes in urine flow and prostaglandin excretion. These findings demonstrate that bile duct ligation in the rat results in impaired renal function, accompanied by increases in renal prostaglandin production. In addition, this study indicates that the perturbations in renal function and renal prostaglandin production induced by bile duct ligation are not mediated by renal sympathetic nerve activity.\r"

We performed this study to determine whether loop colostomies are totally diverting. Twenty-three patients presenting for closure of loop colostomies were given barium by mouth. Serial abdominal films were obtained at intervals over 24 hours. Scout films were obtained after bowel preparation to see if flushing the colon could cause passage of barium into distal bowel. We could not demonstrate passage of barium into the distal limb of the colon in any patient studied. This was true even in long-established loop colostomies. Bowel preparation did not cause passage of barium into the distal colon. Loop colostomies constructed over a rod and matured immediately totally divert the fecal stream. Most surgeons would agree that this type of colostomy is more easily and quickly created and closed. Since it fulfills the criteria for fecal diversion, the use of divided colostomies should be abandoned when a loop colostomy can be utilized.\r"

Twenty-one patients with unilateral iliac artery stenosis or occlusion and ipsilateral superficial femoral artery occlusion underwent crossover femoro-femoro-popliteal sequential bypass during a 9-year period. Seventeen operations were for limb salvage. Patency rates were determined separately for each segment of the bypass. Primary patency rates for the femoro-femoral segment were 89%, 83%, and 57% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Primary patency rates for the femoro-popliteal segments were 68%, 62%, and 40% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Limb salvage rates were 100%, 90%, and 77% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively.

While techniques have been developed to establish EC monolayers on these surfaces, a major question that remains is whether the cells that exist on the blood flow surface are the same cells placed on the surface at the time of transplantation. We have developed an intravital fluorescent staining technique that permits isolated, autologous, fat-derived microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) to be labeled and subsequently detected following their transplantation. In our study, rat abdominal aortas (AA) were injured with a 3F embolectomy catheter, and the injured surfaces were immediately treated with fluorescently labeled MVEC. Five days after transplantation, AA were evaluated by both scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy. Results of scanning electron microscopy showed the existence of nonthrombogenic regions in the areas of injury, and fluorescence microscopy of the identical areas established that these cells contained fluorescent dye. Our results indicate that the cells that line these injured areas of native vessels are the same cells that were originally transplanted. Our intravital fluorescence technique provides a method to trace the origin and disposition of transplanted cells on the vascular surfaces.\r"

A high incidence of nerve (38%), soft tissue (66%), and remote injury (47%) was noted. A comprehensive and integrated approach to vascular, orthopedic, and plastic reconstruction was utilized. Of the 32 patients studied, 1 (3.1%) died as a result of remote injury and sepsis. Amputation was required in 9 patients (28%), while 13 (56%) of the patients with limb salvage showed persistent functional or neurologic deficits. Infection was the most significant factor associated with amputation (p less than 0.0005) and was not avoided by the perioperative use of antibiotics. Delayed amputation resulted in a significant extension of total hospitalization (p less than 0.005). The authors favor an aggressive approach to limb salvage with IIIC injury but recommend early amputation in the presence of significant nerve disruption. An attentive use of tissue debridement, intravenous antibiotics, and early wound coverage is needed to limit infection.\r"

A piezoelectric transducer that functions as a passive, omnidirectional receiver is attached to the mid-balloon region of an angioplasty catheter. Integration to a standard duplex imaging system allows visualization of this receiver in all planes, with the location of the receiver represented by a flashing bright arrow superimposed on the ultrasound B-mode image. This catheter was tested successfully in 10 dogs with bilateral femoral arteriovenous fistulas. With the use of duplex guidance, eight arterial and three venous stenoses were dilated and two stents were placed. Catheter placements and therapeutic outcomes predicted by ultrasound correlated with arteriographic findings. Ultrasound guidance has several advantages. It eliminates the risks associated with radiographic imaging. It also reduces patient costs and discomfort. Furthermore, procedures can be monitored continuously in real time with the collection of anatomic and physiologic data.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with aortic disease and end-stage renal failure who require both aortic reconstruction and renal transplantation (simultaneously or staged) pose a formidable clinical challenge. Traditionally, the performance of either one of these procedures has been viewed as a relative contraindication to the performance of the other. From 1978 to 1989, eight patients were referred to us with the combination of aortic disease and end-stage renal failure. Seven had aneurysmal disease and one had aorto-iliac occlusive disease. Five patients presented with their diseases sequentially and had two sequential operations, with a mean interval of 4 years between procedures. Three patients presented with their diseases simultaneously and underwent simultaneous aortic reconstruction and living related renal transplantation. All patients were followed up for a mean interval of 4.5 years. By life-table analysis, the 5-year renal graft survival was 100%, the primary aortic graft patency was 82%, and the secondary aortic graft patency was 100%. The only death in this series occurred 11 years after aortic reconstruction and 4 months after a renal transplantation and was due to overwhelming cytomegalovirus sepsis. There were no significant differences between the simultaneous and staged groups in terms of operative mortality, postoperative complications, transplant function, or aortic graft patency. From this experience, we conclude that: (1) patients who present simultaneously with aortic disease and end-stage renal failure can safely undergo simultaneous aortic reconstruction and renal transplantation; (2) patients who present with these two diseases sequentially can undergo a second reconstructive procedure with very low operative morbidity and mortality rates; (3) when these two procedures have been performed sequentially, the second procedure has not significantly altered the 30-day or 5-year results of the first procedure; and (4) the 30-day and 5-year results of each procedure have been excellent regardless of the temporal sequence in which they were performed.\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1, 1980, and June 30, 1989, 9 patients (6 males and 3 females) developed ischemic injury to the spinal cord or lumbosacral plexus following 3,320 operations on the abdominal aorta (0.3%). The incidence of this complication was 0.1% (2 of 1,901) after elective and 1.4% (3 of 210) after emergency abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and 0.3% (4 of 1,209) after repair for occlusive disease. Three of the latter had prior clinical evidence of distal embolization. Eight grafts were bifurcated (aorto-iliac:four, aorto-femoral: three, aorto-ilio-femoral:one). One patient underwent extra-anatomic revascularization. Only two patients had supraceliac aortic cross-clamping and one patient underwent exclusion of both internal iliac arteries. Four patients had hypotension. Early mortality was 22% (two of nine). Severe perioperative complications, mostly due to associated visceral and somatic ischemia and sepsis, were present in seven of the nine patients. The extent and type of the neurologic injury correlated with long-term outcome. Patients with ischemic injury of the lumbosacral roots or plexus had better recovery. Attention to the pelvic circulation and the collateral blood supply is important. Use of gentle technique to prevent embolization, avoidance of hypotension and prolonged supraceliac cross-clamping, revascularization of at least one internal iliac artery, and the use of heparin may decrease but not eliminate paraplegia. Once this unexpected complication occurs, careful neurologic evaluation should be done to localize the lesion and aid prognosis.\r"

Obviously some patients had more than one regional complication. Five patients died from complications of HA/PFA ischemia. Survivors included two patients who required a hemipelvectomy, one patient who required an axillary-to-hypogastric artery bypass graft for stump salvage, and one patient who survived despite lumbosacral paralysis and complete cystectomy. The 56% mortality and 100% morbidity emphasize the critical significance of combined hypogastric/profunda femoral artery circulatory compromise. Efforts should be made to preserve or re-establish the HA and/or PFA circulation whenever possible. A hemipelvectomy may be required to allow the wounds to finally heal. Furthermore, the certainty of an above-the-knee amputation healing is not present in these patients; therefore, a hemodynamic assessment of the healing potential of an above-the-knee amputation is required.\r"

Fourteen (27%, 14 of 51) patients had a prior infrarenal aneurysm resection (PRA); their data are analyzed separately. The average age of patients who had undergone PRA was 67 years (range: 56 to 86 years). The mean aneurysm diameter was 8.6 cm (range: 5 to 12 cm), and the mean time interval between initial aneurysm surgery and subsequent resection of the thoracoabdominal aneurysm was 8.5 years (range: 2 to 17 years). Three patients in the PRA group were operated on emergently, two because of clinical evidence of rupture; the other patients underwent elective repair. Early mortality (30 days) in the PRA group was significantly related to age (72 years or older versus younger than 72 years: 75% versus 10%, p = 0.04), proximal extent of aneurysm (above diaphragm versus below diaphragm: 50% versus 0%, p = 0.05), ruptured aneurysm (ruptured versus nonruptured: 100% versus 16%, p = 0.06), and a cardiac history of myocardial infarction (57% versus 0%, p = 0.03), congestive heart failure (66% versus 0%, p = 0.01), or arrhythmia (80% versus 0%, p = 0.005). Similar results were seen with the entire group of patients with thoracoabdominal aneurysms except that the proximal extent of the aneurysm was not related to mortality. These results demonstrate that thoracoabdominal aneurysm resection after prior infrarenal aneurysmectomy is not associated with increased mortality or morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "Reports of high mortality and amputation rates following total excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection have prompted the use of alternate approaches including local antibiotics, partial resection, in situ revascularization, and graft excision without revascularization. Experience with aortic graft infection was reviewed to establish current morbidity and mortality rates and evaluate our bias in favor of total excision and extra-anatomic bypass. Aortic graft infection was identified in 32 patients, 8 with aortoenteric fistulas. The mean interval between graft placement and infection was 34 months. History of groin exposure (75%) or multiple prior vascular surgery (50%) was common. Clinical signs included fever and/or leukocytosis (23 patients), false aneurysm (9 patients), graft thrombosis (6 patients), groin infection (11 patients), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (6 patients). Microbiologic data, available in 26 patients, demonstrated gram-positive organisms in 15 patients and gram-negative in 9. Multiple organisms were seen in 11 patients. Patients were treated by partial removal with (8 patients) or without (4 patients) revascularization or total removal with (18 patients) or without (2 patients) revascularization. Revascularization was by an extra-anatomic route, either simultaneous or staged. Overall morbidity/mortality was less in the revascularized groups (p = 0.01), while late complications were seen only after partial removal (p less than 0.01). The best results were found after total excision with revascularization. No patient in this group experienced late infection or amputation during a mean follow-up of 34 months (range: 1 to 168 months). Complications after total excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection are lower than generally appreciated. This approach should remain the standard to which other approaches are compared.\r"

We found that MRI provides a rapid and reliable means of \"viewing\" the diabetic foot. Unsuspected or poorly localized abscess cavities can be pinpointed for thorough drainage with minimal exploration. An abscess can be differentiated from cellulitis or osteomyelitis. Moreover, persistent fever following drainage of a foot abscess can be reliably evaluated via MRI, obviating the need for empiric surgical reexploration. This exciting noninvasive imaging technique leads to the most accurate surgical drainage of foot abscesses and, at the same time, can prevent unnecessary surgical exploration of the tenuous diabetic foot.\r"

The indications for surgery were tissue necrosis or ulceration in 18 (43%) patients and rest pain in 17 (40%) patients. The 5-year primary graft patency and limb salvage rates for AUF bypass were 74% and 84%, respectively. The perioperative mortality rate was 5%. There were no significant differences in the primary graft patency or limb salvage rates in patients who underwent AUF bypass with or without FP/D bypass. Only 3 of 41 (7%) AUF bypass patients required subsequent femorofemoral bypass. We conclude that: (1) AUF bypass is a safe and effective surgical option in patients with unilateral limb-threatening ischemia and aortic or bilateral iliac occlusive disease; (2) the routine performance of an aortobifemoral or axillobifemoral bypass in patients with unilateral limb-threatening ischemia may be unnecessary; and (3) AUF bypass facilitates the combined inflow and infrainguinal operations that are frequently required for limb salvage in these patients.\r"

The prophylactic regimen for DVT in this study was 5,000 U of subcutaneous heparin every 12 hours. This was used in 50 patients at the discretion of the attending physician, while the remaining 50 patients received no DVT prophylaxis. Fourteen of 50 patients (28%) who were receiving heparin developed DVT, while only 1 patient (2%) of the 50 who did not receive heparin developed DVT. The use of heparin did not provide any significant protection in the susceptible trauma patient. It is believed that those patients with minimal lower extremity injuries, lower injury severity scores, and a shorter period of immobilization do not require any form of DVT prophylaxis. However, those patients at increased risk for DVT are better served with either increased doses of heparin or alternative forms of DVT prophylaxis.\r"

To examine our experience, the charts of patients with penetrating injuries of the extremities were retrospectively reviewed. Data from 82 consecutive patients with 98 wounds over the 5-year period from January 1984 to December 1988 were reviewed. Sixty-five arteriograms were obtained to investigate 98 wounds: 8 to localize a clinically apparent wound and 57 because of proximity of the wound or the trajectory of the injuring agent to a major neurovascular bundle. Of the 57 arteriograms obtained because of proximity, 11 identified a vascular injury (19%). Six of these wounds required vascular repair; five patients were treated expectantly. Six of the eight arteriograms obtained for clinical indications were positive (75%), while two were negative (25%). There were no amputations in the study, and all vascular reconstructions were considered successful by clinical and vascular laboratory criteria. One patient died of thoracic injuries; otherwise, all patients were discharged in good condition. Long-term follow-up was not available. In summary, 19% of arteriograms done because of proximity criteria alone identified a clinically occult vascular injury. While only 11% of all proximity arteriograms revealed injuries requiring surgical repair, this rate of significant injury warrants aggressive use of proximity arteriography in a patient population that is prone to poor follow-up.\r"

This report describes the technique of stab evulsion phlebectomy performed in an outpatient setting. Under loco-regional anesthesia, and after high ligation, existing tributary and trunk varicosities are evulsed with specially designed hooks. The multiple stab incisions, 1.5- to 3-mm long, are closed with adhesive strips. Fifty-six patients, with 69 involved limbs, have been operated on during the past 9 months. Postoperative pain and complications were minimal. Convalescence was eliminated and all patients immediately resumed normal daily activities. Cosmesis was excellent. This technique is based on hemodynamically accurate principles. It effectively removes all varicosities, eliminates the proximal source of reflux, and disconnects potentially outflowing perforators, yet leaves in situ undamaged trunk veins, which may be used as potential vein grafts.\r"

The diagnosis was based on the following criteria: (1) development of thrombocytopenia of less than 100,000/mm3 during administration of heparin therapy, (2) normalization of the platelet count after an interruption in heparin therapy, (3) exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia, (4) a positive heparin-induced platelet aggregation test, (5) detection of white clots on pathologic examination, and (6) the presence of thrombotic complications. Of 2,500 patients who received heparin therapy, 12 (0.48%) developed white clot syndrome. Various indications, routes of administration, and types of heparin were implicated. The mean platelet nadir was 26,900/mm3, and the mean time to onset of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was 5 days. Thrombotic complications included arterial occlusions of the legs in 11 patients, deep vein thrombosis of the legs in 9 patients (4 had pulmonary embolism), and combined arterial and venous thrombosis in 8 patients. Treatment strategies included discontinuation of heparin in all patients and intravenous infusion of dextran, followed by arterial thrombectomy in four patients, urokinase therapy in two patients for arterial complications, and insertion of Greenfield filters in six patients. All patients were given warfarin. The mortality rate was 25% and the morbidity rate was 50%. An initial platelet count should be obtained on all patients prior to receiving heparin, followed by repeat platelet counts every 2 to 3 days. Once thrombocytopenia or thrombosis is diagnosed, heparin should be discontinued and other methods of therapy considered.\r"

We retrospectively reviewed all carotid duplex scans (4,000) performed at our institution between 1985 through 1989 and found for analysis 91 scans in 78 patients who underwent a screening duplex scan because of the presence of peripheral vascular disease. Patients with carotid bruits, abnormal carotid pulses, and focal or nonspecific neurologic symptoms were excluded. Thirty-three percent of these patients had carotid stenosis of 16% to 50%, 14% had carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 50%, and 5% had stenosis greater than or equal to 75%. Individual risk factors for atherosclerosis, including elderly age, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and a recent or past history of cardiac or vascular surgery, did not predict the detection of high-grade carotid stenosis. However, all 11 of the patients with carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 50% were 68 years of age and older, and this age range, in combination with the various risk factors, increased the incidence of significant carotid artery stenosis (greater than or equal to 50%) to as high as 45%. We conclude that routine screening carotid duplex scan is indicated in elderly patients (age greater than or equal to 68 years) with peripheral vascular disease, even in the absence of any signs or symptoms of carotid artery disease, when other atherosclerotic risk factors are present.\r"

The status of the contralateral carotid artery has also been thought to influence the need for placing a shunt. The relationship of EEG monitoring, stump pressure, and the contralateral carotid artery has not been completely delineated. We retrospectively reviewed these three variables in 113 patients undergoing 124 carotid endarterectomies. The contralateral artery was classified as occluded, stenotic (greater than 50% decrease in diameter), or nonstenotic. There was a 48% incidence of EEG changes with contralateral occlusion, 18% with stenosis, and 21% with nonstenotic arteries (p = 0.014). There was a 73% incidence of EEG changes when the stump pressure was less than 25 mm Hg, 32% when the stump pressure was 25 to 50 mm Hg, and 2% when the stump pressure was greater than 50 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). There was no significant difference in the mean stump pressure for patients with occlusion (43.8 mm Hg), stenosis (44.7 mm Hg), or nonstenotic contralateral arteries (51.3 mm Hg). All patients with contralateral occlusion and a stump pressure less than 25 mm Hg had EEG changes. No patient with a stump pressure greater than 50 mm Hg and a patent contralateral artery had EEG changes. Although the incidence of EEG changes in the majority of patients was not accurately predicted by the stump pressure and the status of the contralateral carotid artery, stump pressure less than or equal to 50 mm Hg was sensitive, identifying 97% of patients with EEG changes.\r"

During the 5-year period from 1985 through 1989, 159 carotid reconstructions were done. There were four major strokes (3%), one eventually resulting in death, with the second death in this series from a myocardial infarction (mortality 1%). The combined mortality/major stroke morbidity incidence was 3%. Three transient ischemic attacks (2%) postoperatively cleared promptly without residua. During the latter 1980s, an increasing number of vascular surgeons were doing less carotid surgery. Monitoring institutional quality assurance and individual surgeon performance within the community hospital is becoming a reality. Our experience with institutional guidelines for the evaluation and conduct of carotid surgery, together with an assessment of results and ongoing individual surgeon performance, is presented. Maintaining acceptable morbidity and mortality statistics can be enhanced by having a plan for assessment, management, and concurrent review.\r"

The average daily cost for a spontaneously breathing patient was 399 pounds (95% confidence intervals 388 pounds-460 pounds) while that for a ventilated patient was 726 pounds (656 pounds-795 pounds). The mean total cost per patient was 1980 pounds, but the cost per survivor increased by 16% (347 pounds) because of four deaths on the intensive care unit. High total costs are associated with increased severity of illness and higher marginal (treatment) costs are associated with increased semi-fixed (staff) costs. The cost of intensive therapy was three to five times that for general ward care.\r"

Percentages of CD2 and CD4 lymphocytes increased significantly, but numbers of cells in T lymphocyte subpopulations (total, helper and cytotoxic/suppressor lymphocytes) were not significantly altered. B lymphocytes were most strongly affected: they decreased during working periods and did not recover after holidays. Natural killer (NK) cells, on the other hand, decreased significantly during exposure, but fully recovered during holidays. After stimulation with mitogens, phytohaemaglutin, concanavalin A, and pokeweed, lymphocytes from exposed personnel incorporated significantly more 3H-thymidine than those from control subjects, but stimulation indices did not differ. The natural killer-cell activity, serum Ig concentrations and phagocytosis by granulocytes were not altered.\r"

A new, sensitive, method was used to measure the latency of analgesia. The onset of analgesia was defined by the time taken for the pain intensity score to reach a specified percentage of the baseline value. Twenty-five percent of patients achieving a 50% reduction in baseline pain intensity score appears to be the most appropriate parameter to assess the speed of onset of analgesia of ketorolac and morphine in the postoperative setting. Paired comparison demonstrated that ketorolac had a significantly faster onset of analgesia (p = 0.03) when compared to placebo, whilst comparison of morphine to placebo analgesic latency (p = 0.06) just failed to reach significance. There was no significant difference between the analgesic onset time of ketorolac and morphine (p = 0.73). Intramuscular ketorolac and intramuscular morphine have comparable analgesic onset times in the postoperative pain context. However, the sensitive method of measuring onset of analgesia described, highlights the slow onset of analgesia when analgesics of known efficacy are given by the intramuscular route in the postoperative period. More attention should be given to the speed of onset of analgesia in future assessments of analgesics.\r"

The effect of the application of cricoid pressure on the technique was also investigated. Intubation via the laryngeal mask was attempted in 100 routine patients: of the first 50 (group 1, no cricoid pressure), 45 (90%) were successfully intubated. Maintenance of cricoid pressure throughout the manoeuvre (group 2) reduced the success rate significantly to 56% (p less than 0.05). Despite the possibility that cricoid pressure may have to be interrupted momentarily, the ease with which the technique can be learnt, and the immediate availability of the necessary apparatus suggest that it should be considered for inclusion in failed intubation drill.\r"

Large differences between peak airway and alveolar pressures developed when frequency was increased or inspiratory time decreased; the differences were greatest with the smaller tubes. Shortening expiratory time by increasing the frequency or altering the inspiratory:expiratory ratio resulted in increased end-expiratory pressure because of incomplete emptying of the lung.\r"

We present an in vitro study of nine commercially available bacterial filters to determine whether or not the aspiration test could be reliably performed through them. Eight of the nine filters (except the Perifix, Braun) were found to be unreliable if air and liquid were both present in the system (air lock). The role of the aspiration test and the use of micropore filters in epidural analgesia are discussed, as are the implications and possible solutions in practice of this cause of failure of the test.\r"

The catheter was inserted through either a Tuohy or Quincke-tip needle and isobaric amethocaine used for the initial injection. In five patients identification of the subarachnoid space was not straightforward, but clear difficulty with catheter insertion was encountered in only one. The range of blocks seen was wider than expected, but it was adequate for surgery 15 minutes after injection in 16 of the 20 patients. In another three the injection of a small dose of hyperbaric bupivacaine produced the necessary extension of block. Two patients (10%) required a general anaesthetic, one because of grossly inadequate spread of solution, the other because the catheter kinked and prevented injection of a second dose after the start of surgery.\r"

The use of 18-gauge catheters, after injection of 10 ml of 0.9% saline, resulted in a significant (p less than 0.01) reduction in the incidence of extradural vein cannulation.

Patients were randomly allocated to one of the following groups: Group A--dipyridamole 75 mg three times daily and aspirin 330 mg once daily: Group B--physical exercise; Group C--physical exercise and dipyridamole 75 mg three time daily and aspirin 330 mg once daily. After six months' treatment the pain-free walking time (PFWT) and the maximum walking time (MWT) improved significantly (p less than 0.05) in all three groups. In group A the PFWT lengthened by 35% (from 101.00 +/- 34.56 to 137.32 +/- 40.50 s) and the MWT by 38% (from 150.34 +/- 55.60 to 207.26 +/- 60.67 s); in group B the PFWT lengthened by 90% (from 90.65 +/- 40.54 to 171.45 +/- 55.60 s) and the MWT by 86% (from 145.39 +/- 60.50 to 270.63 +/- 63.61 s). When physical exercise was associated with drugs as in group C, the PFWT lengthened by 120% (from 89.51 +/- 43.89 to 196.72 +/- 51.73 s) and the MWT by 105% (from 160.43 +/- 59.84 to 329.05 +/- 63.96 s). No significant variations were observed at any stage of the study in the ankle/arm pressure ratio at rest and after standard treadmill exercise, in the plethysmographic rest and peak flows, or in the transcutaneous oxygen pressure in basal conditions and in its half recovery time after an induced ischemia. The results confirm the benefits of regular exercise in stage II PAOD patients but suggest they may be enhanced by antiplatelet therapy.\r"

There were 25 women and 25 men. The mean age was sixty-six years (range thirty-two to eighty-one). The indications for pacing were complete heart block in 16 patients and sick sinus syndrome in the remainder. All pacemakers were of the single-chamber ventricular pacing type and had been implanted for a mean period of four years (range two to seven). In 27 patients the route of entry for the pacing electrode was through the cephalic vein and in the other 23 patients the subclavian veins were used. Of the 50 venograms, 1 showed partial and 1 showed total obstruction at the subclavian vein. Both patients (4%) were asymptomatic. All others (96%) were normal. The incidence of venous thrombosis was not related to the routes of entry of the pacing electrodes. All patients tolerated the procedure well and had no complications. It is concluded that the incidence of venous thrombosis after long-term transvenous pacing is extremely low in the Chinese (4%), and venograms are both safe and useful for identifying venous thrombosis related to transvenous pacing.\r"

In the other 3 cases, no arterial lesion was found (3 false positives). Among the 21 patients with normal findings from angiography, 10 had surgical exploration because of high clinical suspicion of vascular injury. Arterial injury was found in 2 cases (2 false negatives). In 8 patients, arteriography modified the surgical procedure. In the 11 remaining patients, clinical and echo Doppler follow-up results were normal, a negative predictive value of 90% (19/21). Sensitivity was 97%, specificity 86%, and accuracy 95%. These data show that arteriography in stable patients is a safe and accurate procedure. It permits avoidance of unnecessary surgical exploration in selected patients and helps modify the surgical procedure.\r"

  ".W": "A new apparatus for the treatment of edema of the extremities is described. The extremity is placed in a cylindrical vertical tank and isolated by a circumferential synthetic rubber membrane. The equipment is programmed to create a mold of the extremity using a slurry of plastic granules from a reservoir. Mercury is then pumped between the mold and the extremity, thereby exerting a pressure gradient on the extremity equal to the hydrostatic pressure of the mercury column. A computerized program forms the mold and runs several compression cycles for each treatment session. Twelve patients were treated (8 upper extremities, 4 lower extremities) on a weekly or semiweekly basis. Progress was followed with computed axial tomography scans, as well as measurements and photographs. Ten patients experienced significant immediate decrease in edema with each treatment. Wrapping or elastic support was required to prevent the return of edema between treatments. No pain, skin injury, or other complication of treatment was noted. The apparatus can safely provide short-term, immediate, significant improvement of extremity edema. Further studies will be necessary to determine long-term benefit.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to examine the effect of blood glucose level on survival and pathologic changes of the cortical neuronal cells during and after three-hour incomplete cerebral ischemia, which was induced by bilateral carotid artery ligation in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Blood glucose levels were varied by intraperitoneal infusion of 50% glucose (hyperglycemia) or insulin with hypertonic saline (hypoglycemia) or hypertonic saline (normoglycemia). None of the hyperglycemic or normoglycemic animals died during three-hour ischemia, whereas 45% of hypoglycemic animals died (p greater than 0.001). The survival rate for twenty-four hours after recirculation was in the following ascending order: hypoglycemia, normoglycemia, and hyperglycemia. Neither hypoglycemia nor hyperglycemia (38-392 mg/dL) in nonischemic animals developed any morphologic changes in the cerebral cortex. However, both the ischemic and recirculated brains showed various degrees of histologic changes such as shrinkage of the neuronal cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles, perineuronal edema, and swelling of neuropils. Such ischemic damage of the brain was more marked in hypoglycemic animals than in hyperglycemic or normoglycemic ones during ischemia, as well as one hour after recirculation. The results suggest that cerebral ischemia and its outcome become more deleterious in hypoglycemic than in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic states. On the other hand, hyperglycemia is not necessarily a disadvantage in acute cerebral ischemia with or without reperfusion in this model.\r"

  ".W": "Two-dimensional echocardiography has had a significant impact on and is considered the technique of choice for the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis. Over a thirty-six month period, 106 patients were evaluated by echocardiography for the possibility of endocarditis. The diagnosis of endocarditis was determined by strict clinical and laboratory criteria. All clinical histories, blood cultures, echocardiograms, and autopsy results were reviewed. Five echocardiograms were technically inadequate, resulting in a study population of 101 patients. The age of the patients ranged from forty-five days to eighty-eight years (mean fifty-seven years). The clinical manifestations of endocarditis included fever (83%), chills (60%), congestive heart failure (25%), and splenomegaly (18%). Twelve patients had preexisting valvular or congenital heart disease. Gram-positive cocci were the most common microorganisms. Complications included mitral regurgitation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, renal infarction, stroke, and a pulmonary embolus. The patients were divided into two groups: Group I consisted of 36 patients with definite vegetations by echocardiography, and Group II had 65 patients with no vegetations. In Group I, acute infective endocarditis was present in 35 patients, whereas only 4 patients had endocarditis in Group II. The sensitivity of two-dimensional echocardiography for detecting endocarditis was 90%. The specificity was 98%. The predictive accuracy for a positive test was 97%, and the predictive accuracy for a negative test was 94%. Thus, two-dimensional echocardiography appears to have a high sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value in the evaluation of patients with suspected endocarditis.\r"

Catheterization was accomplished with a 5 Fr catheter over a 0.035 inch guidewire under fluoroscopic control, and angiograms were obtained by injection of a diatrizoate solution. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed prior to cocaine administration and at minutes 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 5, and, in some cases, minutes 10 and 15 after cocaine administration. The 1 and 3 mg/kg doses of cocaine had no effect on the coronary arteries. The 5 mg/kg dose significantly dilated the coronary arteries. The 8 mg/kg dose produced significant dilation at 30 seconds after cocaine but nonsignificant dilation of the coronary arteries at all other times. The 10 mg/kg dose produced significant dilation at 30 seconds, nonsignificant dilation at 60 seconds followed by significant constriction at 90 seconds after cocaine, which led to immediate death in most animals. The coronary dilation and constriction produced by 10 mg/kg of cocaine could be prevented by either preadministration or postadministration of naloxone, but this did not prevent subsequent death.\r"

Laser-assisted angioplasty is an optional therapy that the authors investigated in 28 prosthetic grafts over a two-year period. Twenty-five symptomatic patients with 28 peripheral prosthetic arterial bypass grafts (25 polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] grafts and 1 each of knitted Dacron, Teflon, and umbilical vein) demonstrated graft occlusion (25) or high-grade stenoses (3). All patients underwent standard laser-assisted angioplasty using a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser source and hybrid probe. Twenty-one grafts (75%) were successfully recanalized with adequate restoration of flow through the conduit. All 7 failures were in occluded PTFE grafts that presented with either recalcitrant lesions (5) or perforations (2) at the distal anastomoses. There have been 3 long-term failures (14%) to date in the successfully treated group, all in PTFE grafts. Two patients suffered recurrent thrombosis and 1 developed an inexplicable graft infection five months after laser treatment. Laser-assisted angioplasty appears to be a clinically viable alternative treatment for prosthetic graft stenosis and recanalization of grafts occluded at their distal anastomosis.\r"

DESIGN: A prospective study of consecutively treated patients with primary breast cancer. SETTING: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York. PATIENTS: Two hundred and eighty-three premenopausal patients treated by mastectomy and axillary dissection. MAIN RESULTS: When the tumor was excised during the follicular phase, approximated by setting the putative day of ovulation on day 14 after the onset of last menses, a higher recurrence risk (43%) was observed compared with excision later in the menstrual cycle (29%, P = 0.02). The rate peaked among patients treated between days 7 and 14 and was lowest between days 20 and 30. Multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model to control for tumor size, nodal status, estrogen receptor status, adjuvant chemotherapy, and family history indicated that the hazard rate of breast cancer recurrence after excision during the follicular phase was 1.53 (95% Cl, 1.02 to 2.29). Stratification by nodal status indicated that the effect of phase was statistically significant only among patients with positive nodes (hazard ratio, 2.10; Cl, 1.19 to 3.70). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that the risk for recurrence may be affected by the hormonal milieu of the menstrual cycle; these findings must be confirmed, however, by a prospective study in which cycle phase at time of tumor excision is biochemically documented.\r"

DESIGN: Registry with prospective follow-up. SETTING: Thirty-two clinical centers in the United States participating in the Patient Registry for the Characterization of Primary Pulmonary Hypertension supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. PATIENTS: Patients (194) diagnosed at clinical centers between 1 July 1981 and 31 December 1985 and followed through 8 August 1988. MEASUREMENTS: At diagnosis, measurements of hemodynamic variables, pulmonary function, and gas exchange variables were taken in addition to information on demographic variables, medical history, and life-style. Patients were followed for survival at 6-month intervals. MAIN RESULTS: The estimated median survival of these patients was 2.8 years (95% Cl, 1.9 to 3.7 years). Estimated single-year survival rates were as follows: at 1 year, 68% (Cl, 61% to 75%); at 3 years, 48% (Cl, 41% to 55%); and at 5 years, 34% (Cl, 24% to 44%). Variables associated with poor survival included a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class of III or IV, presence of Raynaud phenomenon, elevated mean right atrial pressure, elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure, decreased cardiac index, and decreased diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Drug therapy at entry or discharge was not associated with survival duration. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was most closely associated with right ventricular hemodynamic function and can be characterized by means of an equation using three variables: mean pulmonary artery pressure, mean right atrial pressure, and cardiac index. Such an equation, once validated prospectively, could be used as an adjunct in planning treatment strategies and allocating medical resources.\r"

PATIENTS: A total of 158 patients with newly or previously diagnosed active ulcerative colitis. INTERVENTION: A pH-sensitive, polymer-coated oral preparation of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) was used at 1.6 and 2.4 g/d for 6 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy was measured by scores for stool frequency, rectal bleeding, patient's functional assessment, sigmoidoscopic findings, and physician's global assessment. Stringent criteria for disease activity were established prospectively. RESULTS: The analysis of protocol-compliant patients showed a significant improvement at 3 weeks in patients taking 2.4 g/d of mesalamine compared with patients taking placebo (32% versus 9%; P = 0.003). At 6 weeks, both the 1.6 g/d (43%) and 2.4 g/d (49%) doses were significantly superior to placebo (23%) (P = 0.03 and P = 0.003, respectively). In addition, more patients worsened in the placebo group compared with the 2.4 g/d group (50% versus 19%; P = 0.003); however, there was no statistically significant difference in worsening between the 1.6 g/d mesalamine group and the placebo group. The oral mesalamine tablet was well tolerated, and no clinically significant changes were observed in hematologic, hepatic, or renal laboratory profiles. CONCLUSION: Colon-targeted oral mesalamine at 2.4 g/d is effective therapy for mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. It is well tolerated and should provide a viable therapeutic alternative to sulfasalazine.\r"

DESIGN: Blinded comparison of history and physical examination with results of nocturnal polysomnography. SETTING: Sleep clinic of a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A total of 410 patients referred for suspected sleep apnea syndrome. Most patients reported snoring. MEASUREMENTS: All patients were asked standard questions and given an examination relevant to the diagnosis of the sleep apnea syndrome, and all had full nocturnal polysomnography. Patients with more than ten episodes of apnea or hypopnea per hour of sleep were classified as having sleep apnea. Stepwise linear logistic regression was used to develop two predictive models of sleep apnea: one based on the presence of characteristic clinical features, age, sex, and body mass index; and one based on subjective clinical impression. RESULTS: The prevalence of sleep apnea in our patients was 46%. Only age, body mass index, male sex, and snoring were found to be predictors of sleep apnea. The logistic rule discriminated between patients with and without sleep apnea (receiver operating characteristic [ROC] area, 0.77 [95% Cl, 0.73 to 0.82]). For patients with a predicted probability of apnea of less than 20%, the clinical model had 94% sensitivity and 28% specificity. Subjective impression alone identified correctly only 52% of patients with sleep apnea and had a specificity of 70%. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a high predicted probability of the sleep apnea syndrome, subjective impression alone or any combination of clinical features cannot serve as a reliable screening test. However, in patients with a low predicted probability of sleep apnea, the model based on clinical data was sufficiently sensitive to permit about a 30% reduction in the number of unnecessary sleep studies.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, crossover clinical trial with subjects serving as their own controls. SETTING: The General Clinical Research Center of Indiana University Hospital, Indianapolis, Indiana. PATIENTS: Eight adult volunteers with severe stable CRI (mean creatinine clearance, 0.28 mL/s; range, 0.15 to 0.47 mL/s) were recruited from the outpatient nephrology clinics of Indiana University Medical Center. INTERVENTIONS: On admission, diuretic drugs were withdrawn and patients were equilibrated on an 80 mmol/d sodium, 60 mmol/d potassium metabolic diet. Patients were randomized to receive a 12-mg intravenous dose of bumetanide given either as two 6-mg bolus doses separated by 6 hours or as the same total dose administered as a 12-hour continuous infusion. When sodium balance was re-established, each patient was crossed over to the alternative study limb. All patients completed both phases of the study. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Comparable amounts of bumetanide appeared in the urine during the study period (infusion, 912 +/- 428 micrograms; bolus, 944 +/- 421 micrograms; difference, 32 micrograms; 95% CI, -16 micrograms to 80 micrograms, P = 0.16). The continuous infusion resulted in significantly greater net sodium excretion (infusion, 236 +/- 77 mmol; bolus, 188 +/- 50 mmol; difference, 48 mmol; CI, 16 mmol to 80 mmol, P = 0.01). No patient had episodes of drug-induced myalgias during the continuous infusion compared with 3 of 8 patients with bolus therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe CRI, a continuous intravenous infusion of bumetanide is more effective and less toxic than conventional intermittent bolus therapy. Continuous administration will probably be useful in patients with severe CRI who have not achieved an adequate natriuresis or who show evidence of drug toxicity with standard diuretic dosing regimens. A similar benefit may occur in selected diuretic-resistant patients with cardiac or hepatic disease, and studies in these patients seem warranted.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional study. SETTING: General internal medicine training program at a university-affiliated tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight residents who spent 3 months or more on an internal medicine teaching unit during the previous year and 41 faculty members who spent 2 months or more on one of these units. INTERVENTIONS: Postcall surveys and night-call diaries were used to analyze residents' activities, to derive a definition of scutwork, and to estimate its prevalence. Residents and faculty then completed a detailed questionnaire that included ratings of the educational value, \"scut content,\" and residents' responsibility for 20 specific tasks. MAIN RESULTS: Eighty-three percent of residents found scutwork and education to be mutually exclusive for the 20 tasks, although 20% indicated that scutwork was an appropriate task for residents. Residents' ratings of tasks as scut varied according to the context of the task. For example, obtaining routine consent from someone else's patient was considered scutwork by 98% of residents, whereas obtaining such consent from the residents's own patient was rated as scutwork by only 52% (P less than 0.01). Similarly, performing intravenous cannulation at the request of ward staff was rated as scut by 94% of residents, whereas performing cannulation at another resident's request was rated as scut by 56% (P less than 0.01). Night-time admission of a patient for an elective procedure was rated as scut by 75% of residents, whereas admission of such a patient after discussion with a faculty member was labeled scut by only 44% (P less than 0.01). Faculty ratings of such admissions did not show the same variation (24% for both). Faculty were more likely than residents to assess tasks as educational (50% compared with 26%, P less than 0.01) but were less likely to consider tasks as scutwork (47% compared with 62%, P = 0.12) or as work that should be done by nonresidents (35% compared with 46%, P greater than 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the characteristics of scutwork can be identified, that the perception of scut varies between faculty and residents, and that the context of a task often determines whether residents perceive it as scut.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To synthesize information on hemodynamic determinants of exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Relevant studies published from the mid-1960s to the present were identified by a manual search of the English-language literature and by bibliographic review of pertinent articles. STUDY SELECTION: Both controlled and observational studies that reported measures of either exercise time or oxygen uptake and hemodynamic variables in patients with heart failure were reviewed for quality and included when relevant to the discussion. DATA EXTRACTION: Key conclusions or data, or both, were extracted from each article and described. DATA SYNTHESIS: Exercise intolerance is a hallmark of chronic congestive heart failure. Studies have emphasized central factors and indices of systolic ventricular function, but poor relations have been consistently found between these measurements and exercise capacity. Recent data suggest that diastolic function (that is, ventricular filling and compliance) is an important factor affecting the ability to increase cardiac output and determining exercise capacity, but this issue needs further study. A clearer picture of histologic and biochemical abnormalities in skeletal muscle has recently emerged; patients with heart failure show greater glycolysis, reduced oxidative phosphorylation, and reduced oxidative enzyme activity. Vasodilatory abnormalities in heart failure were first described more than 20 years ago, and such abnormalities may underlie recently reported reductions in skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise. Relative hyperventilation is commonly observed during exercise in patients with heart failure and is related to ventilation-perfusion mismatching in the lung due to a higher-than-normal fraction of physiologic dead space. Neurohumoral abnormalities include reductions in beta-receptor density and sensitivity and contribute to reduced inotropic and chronotropic responses to exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Systolic function and exercise capacity are unrelated in patients with chronic heart failure, but many hemodynamic abnormalities (including those in the heart, lung, and skeletal muscle) overlap, which leads to exercise intolerance in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids on human muscle strength. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search for the period from January 1966 to April 1990, supplemented by manual searches of previous reviews, produced 30 studies in which subjects received more than one dose of the study steroid and in which changes in muscular strength were measured. STUDY SELECTION: Of the 30 studies, 14 were not included in the detailed data summary because they did not use a placebo control, did not randomize subjects to groups, or did not make objective strength measurements, or because percent change in strength data could not be abstracted. DATA EXTRACTION: Details of study design, reporting of results, and the adequacy and correctness of statistical methods were tabulated. Percent improvement in strength for the largest muscle group studied was computed, using the difference between results for the placebo and for the steroid-treated groups. DATA SYNTHESIS: Previously trained athletes show slightly greater improvements in strength in the anabolic-androgenic steroid-treated group than in the placebo group, with a median difference of 5% across the nine studies (range, 1.2% to 18.7%). A meta-analysis of the three studies with enough information to compute effect size showed a mean difference of 1.0 standard deviations (95% CI, 0.49 to 1.5). However, the poor overall quality of the studies in terms of design, sample size, and analysis; the lack of a dose-response effect across the narrow range of dosages tested; and the tendency for differences to be smaller in the larger studies throw these results into question. No evidence was found to support enhanced muscle strength with steroid use in eight studies in untrained normal volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: Anabolic steroids may slightly enhance muscle strength in previously trained athletes. No firm conclusion is possible concerning the efficacy of anabolic steroids in enhancing overall athletic performance. Results for the low steroid dosages studied in the published reports cannot be generalized to steroid-using athletes taking megadose regimens.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the quality of care for common ambulatory conditions is adversely affected when physicians are provided with incentives to limit the use of health services. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study over a 2-year period. SETTING: Four group practices that cared for both fee-for-service patients and prepaid patients within a network model health maintenance organization (HMO). PATIENTS: Equal numbers of prepaid (HMO) and fee-for-service patients were selected by randomly choosing medical records from each group practice: 246 patients with chronic uncomplicated hypertension and 250 women without chronic diseases who received preventive care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adequate hypertension control was defined as a mean blood pressure of less than 150/90. Adequate preventive care was defined as the provision of blood pressure screening, colon cancer screening, breast cancer screening, and cervical cancer screening within guidelines recommended by the 1989 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Resource use was measured by the annual number of visits and tests. MAIN RESULTS: The adjusted relative odds of HMO patients having controlled hypertension, compared with fee-for-service patients, were 1.82 (95% CI, 1.02 to 3.27). The relative risks of HMO patients receiving preventive care within established guidelines were 1.19 (CI, 0.93 to 1.51) for colon cancer screening, 1.78 (CI, 1.11 to 2.84) for annual breast examinations, 1.75 (CI, 1.08 to 2.84) for biannual mammography, and 1.35 (CI, 1.13 to 1.60) for Papanicolaou smears every 3 years. Prepaid patients had visit rates that were 18% to 22% higher than those of fee-for-service patients. CONCLUSIONS: In the type of network model HMO we studied, the quality and quantity of ambulatory care for HMO patients was equal to or better than that for fee-for-service patients. In this setting, the incentives for physicians to limit resource use may be offset by lack of disincentives for HMO patients to seek care.\r"

Contaminated levotryptophan preparations produced at a single manufacturing company between October 1988 and June 1989 have been implicated in all EMS cases. In this study, we analyzed retrospectively 49 patients with cutaneous fibrosis for a history of levotryptophan use. Levotryptophan ingestion prior to the onset of their disease was reported by 11 (65%) of 17 patients with eosinophilic fascilitis (EF), two (20%) of 10 patients with localized scleroderma, and none of 22 patients with systemic sclerosis. The onset of levotryptophan-associated cutaneous disease preceded the availability of contaminated levotryptophan preparations in seven (54%) of 13 patients. One patient with levotryptophan-associated generalized morphea also had lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and acanthosis nigricans, findings not previously reported in patients with EMS. In addition, we compared the clinical and laboratory features of levotryptophan-associated EF and idiopathic EF. Myalgias, muscle weakness, paresthesias, morpheaform plaques, cutaneous ulcers, and livedo reticularis were more common in patients with levotryptophan-associated EF. We conclude that levotryptophan-associated EF and localized scleroderma were present before the presumed date of contaminated levotryptophan availability. The clinical spectrum of cutaneous fibrosis associated with the ingestion of levotryptophan includes generalized morphea and EF, which are similar though not identical to their idiopathic counterparts.\r"

Ninety percent of the keratoacanthomas demonstrated a diffuse pattern within tumor lobules in which all but the most peripheral rim of cells were stained. A similar localization of transforming growth factor alpha was not identified in squamous cell carcinomas. In addition, 40% of the squamous cell carcinomas but none of the keratoacanthomas showed focal transforming growth factor alpha immunostaining. Our results suggest that transforming growth factor alpha expression may be a marker of epithelial differentiation and may help distinguish between these two tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclosporine, an immunosuppressive drug, is effective in the treatment of recalcitrant psoriasis. Previous work suggested that keratinocyte hyperproliferation and inflammation are linked in psoriasis and that immune mechanisms participate in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha may be an important regulatory factor of epidermal growth as overproduction of TGF-alpha is associated with epidermal hyperplasia in psoriatic plaques and epidermal growth factor receptors are overexpressed in psoriatic epithelium. In this study, the effects of cyclosporine on cultured human keratinocytes were examined. Cyclosporine specifically inhibited keratinocyte cell-cycle progression in the G1 phase without causing keratinocytes to terminally differentiate. Cyclosporine did not decrease the expression of TGF-alpha or epidermal growth factor receptors. These results suggest that the effects of cyclosporine on psoriatic skin are unrelated to direct effects on autocrine growth regulation of keratinocytes via TGF-alpha production or of epidermal growth factor receptor modulation.\r"

Localized scleroderma revealed a significant prevalence of anti-single-stranded DNA antibodies, mainly characterized by high levels and IgM and IgA isotypes. Comparison of antibody characteristics in different clinical forms of localized scleroderma showed some significant differences (levels and immunoglobulin isotypes). Comparison with systemic lupus erythematosus showed that frequency, high levels, and IgG isotype of anti-single-stranded DNA antibodies significantly prevailed in systemic lupus erythematosus, while the IgM isotype significantly prevailed in localized scleroderma.

Lesions with the histologic characteristics of condyloma were excluded from the study. Human papillomavirus DNA sequences were found in 24 (42%) of 57 seborrheic keratosis-like lesions from the genital region. No human papillomavirus DNA was detected in 27 control specimens that represented a variety of other processes occurring in this area. We conclude that human papillomavirus infection cannot be excluded in genital seborrheic keratoses.\r"

  ".W": "Both biochemical and auxological measurements can be used to assess growth. Quality control in routinely reported in laboratory studies, but the reproducibility of height measurements, and the height velocity data derived from them, is seldom considered. We have previously established our error and in this report we examine its implications for the screening of short children and subsequent monitoring of their growth. The 95% confidence interval for height for a 5 year old observed to be on the 3rd centile for height, spanned the 2nd-4th centile. However, the confidence interval for a 12 month height velocity appropriate to such a child spanned the 8th-52nd centiles, the lower limit pathological and the upper more than satisfactory. A single height velocity even over 12 months therefore lacks the precision to provide a reliable index of current growth in short children. Furthermore, serial height velocity calculations on a cohort of 78 short normal children showed no significant correlation from year to year, suggesting that velocity is also unable to predict future growth. Although the proportion of this cohort of short children lying beneath the 25th centile for velocity remained constant from year to year, the identity of the individuals comprising that proportion changed, a phenomenon which could be largely accounted for by the random error associated with height velocity. Our data suggest that, by the time a trend in abnormal velocity is reliably established, a deviation from the height centiles is clearly evident. Although velocity charts are attractive in concept, they seem to be no more discriminating than height charts in practice, and may be clinically deceptive unless interpreted with great care.\r"

At diagnosis the girls had a mean age of 8.8 years (range 3.0-13.0); mean bone age was 5.4 years. The mean age of the boys at diagnosis was 9.5 years (range 3.7-14.2); mean bone age was 6.3 years. The patients were treated with thyroxine 100 micrograms/m2/day and serum thyroxine concentrations were maintained in the normal range. During treatment the rate of skeletal maturation exceeded the change in chronological age. Initial mean height SD score for bone age before treatment in the girls was +0.59 and after 11 years of treatment fell to -0.55 Mean height SD score for bone age in the boys decreased from +1.6 to -0.87 during treatment. In the girls the onset of puberty was 1.2 years later than the normal population but the duration of puberty was reduced. Mean age (SD) of menarche was 13.8 (1.7) years. The pattern of growth in girls with treated hypothyroidism was abnormal as growth continued after menarche, at a time when normal girls have almost stopped growing. During the second year after menarche our patients still had a mean growth velocity of 4.1 cm/year. Our data suggest that juvenile primary hypothyroidism results in a permanent height deficit. In addition, there is a loss of the normal harmony between growth and sexual maturation in girls, despite adequate treatment, in that growth continues for much longer after menarche than in normal girls.\r"

The dose of oxandrolone used was a mean of 0.05 mg/kg (range 0.03-0.18) for a mean of 0.9 years (range 0.2-3.6). Height velocity increased from a mean (SD) before treatment of 4.0 (1.0) to 7.5 (1.2) cm/year with oxandrolone. Growth rate was sustained at 7.6 (2.2) cm/year in the period after treatment. Those boys who attained a testicular volume of 4 ml or greater at the end of the treatment period had the most pronounced sustained growth acceleration. Height for bone age SD score did not alter significantly from a mean of -1.0 before treatment to -1.2 after treatment. Oxandrolone is a safe and effective treatment for prepubertal boys with constitutional growth delay.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 3025 families with schoolchildren aged 6-8 years were offered pilot screening for familial hypercholesterolaemia by measurement of the concentrations of apolipoproteins A-1 and B in the children's capillary blood and by analysis of their family histories of early ischaemic heart disease. The concentrations of the apolipoproteins were determined by double rocket immunoelectrophoresis of an eluate of blood spotted on filter paper. Results were available from 2085 children. Because their B:A-1 ratio was above the 97.5 centile and their concentration of B was above the 99th centile, 54 children (2.6%) were selected to have their apolipoprotein concentrations reassessed. The 17 children (0.8%) whose values were persistently above the chosen cut off points, and all of their available first and second degree relatives, had fasting determinations of serum lipid concentrations carried out. Raised serum concentrations of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and an autosomal dominant pattern of hypercholesterolaemia were found in 12 children and 10 families, respectively, suggesting a higher incidence of familial hypercholesterolaemia than the reported 1:500. Further investigations among family members disclosed hypercholesterolaemia in 29 relatives. A family history of early ischaemic heart disease was elicited by questionnaire, and was positive in only five of the 12 schoolchildren with hypercholesterolaemia. We conclude that analysis of apolipoproteins from capillary blood spotted on filter paper is suitable for screening for familial hypercholesterolaemia, and that this method is more efficient than screening based on family history.\r"

Twenty one infants had a pH under 4 for more than 5% of the time (one definition of abnormal GOR) and nine had GOR exceeding age related normal values. Maximum expiratory flow at functional residual capacity was reduced in 37 infants, airways resistance was raised in 19 infants, and thoracic gas volume was abnormal in 11 infants. There was no association between indices of GOR and measures of lung function whether assessed by correlation or by chi 2 analysis for normal versus abnormal values. However, individual infants appeared to have respiratory symptoms produced by GOR. This suggests that host responsiveness to GOR may be of greater relevance than the amount of GOR.\r"

Notified cases were significantly less likely to have been vaccinated than other cases with similar symptoms. Therefore vaccine efficacy estimates based upon notified cases are likely to be biased.

Treatment varied over the study period. Seven children received a bone marrow allograft from a full match family donor and three a matched unrelated donor transplant after failed treatment with antilymphocyte globulin. The remainder were treated with antilymphocyte globulin (n = 11), antilymphocyte globulin and oxymetholone (n = 4), oxymetholone with or without prednisolone (n = 12), or supportive treatment alone (n = 1). With a minimum follow up of one year since treatment, the five year survival was 70% for bone marrow transplantation with a family donor, 30% for antilymphocyte globulin, and 25% for oxymetholone. All three children with a matched unrelated donor transplant died. The prognosis of acquired aplastic anaemia remains poor for most children and new approaches to treatment are urgently required.\r"

The patients with coeliac disease had been on a gluten free diet during the previous two years. After the gluten load lactulose and L-rhamnose urinary excretion changed significantly in patients, and a significant increase in the lactulose: L-rhamnose ratio was also observed. No significant changes were observed in the controls. In view of the modification of the three biopsies diagnostic protocol made by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, permeability tests associated with single gluten challenges may be an added contribution to the accuracy of the diagnosis in childhood.\r"

The volunteer subjects were given 5 g of sodium benzoate orally and the two patients with urea cycle disorders (carbamyl phosphate synthetase deficiency type I and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency) were already undergoing treatment with sodium benzoate and L-carnitine. The amount of benzoylcarnitine excretion depended on the dose of both sodium benzoate and L-carnitine in a reciprocal relation. Increased excretions of acetylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine were also noted after sodium benzoate administration. The alteration of the urinary aclycarnitine profile was consistent with the change of mitochondrial CoA profile predicted by in vitro studies of an animal model. It is suggested that urinary acylcarnitine analysis is important to assess the effect of benzoate administration on mitochondrial function in vivo. Supplementation with carnitine may be necessary to minimise the adverse effects of sodium benzoate treatment in hyperammonaemia.\r"

Lateral radiographs of the cervical spine were taken in flexed, extended, and neutral positions, and the percentage of abnormalities in each view was 14, 10, and 10%, respectively. Gait was the only significant clinical predictor. The relative risk of having an abnormal neck radiograph with an abnormal gait was 2.91 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1 to 8). The sensitivity was 50% and the specificity 81%. Nineteen children had repeat radiographs to assess the reliability of radiological diagnosis. Six had abnormalities; five of 19 (26%) had an abnormality on the first radiograph, and four of 19 (21%) had an abnormality on a second radiograph, but only three (15%) had an abnormality on both occasions in any view (95% CI 0 to 25). We conclude that radiographs of the cervical spine are unreliable at identifying atlantoaxial subluxation in children with Down's syndrome, and we failed to identify any reliable clinical predictor.\r"

Distance from skin to muscle fascia was measured by ultrasonography at standard injection sites on the outer arm, anterior and lateral thigh, abdomen, buttock, and calf. Distances were greater in girls (n = 15) than in boys (n = 17). Whereas in most boys the distances were less than the length of the needle (12.5 mm) at all sites except the buttock, in most girls, the distances were greater than 12.5 mm except over the calf. Over the fascial plane just lateral to the rectus muscle the distance from skin to peritoneum was less than 12.5 mm in 14 of the 17 boys and one of the 15 girls. Twenty five of the 32 children injected at an angle of 90 degrees, and 24 children raised a skinfold before injecting. By raising a skinfold over the anterior thigh, the distance from skin to muscle fascia was increased by 19% (range 0-38%). We conclude that most boys and some girls who use the perpendicular injection technique may often inject insulin into muscle, and perhaps on occasions into the peritoneal cavity.\r"

We have estimated the effects of treatment from overviews of the relevant controlled trials, and estimated costs from observations of care at one neonatal unit. Our results suggest that if either of these policies is adopted for all babies under 35 weeks' gestation at a drug cost of 150 pounds or less/baby, the overall costs of care would be reduced by between 1 and 10%. The cost per survivor would be reduced by up to 16% even if the drug cost were to be as high as pounds 550/baby. If the policies were to be adopted only for babies under 31 weeks' gestation, both policies would result in a reduction in cost of between 5 and 16%/survivor, although the increased survival resulting from the policies would lead to an increase in overall costs for babies of less then 31 weeks' gestation of between 7 and 32%.\r"

There was a sevenfold increase in the annual incidence of chronic lung disease over time. During the same period there were significant increases in the number of infants who survived, the incidence of septicaemia, and the use of parenteral lipid emulsions. Chronic lung disease was significantly associated with low birth weight, shorter gestation, duration of ventilation, vaginal delivery, sepsis, and the use of lipid. Respiratory and physiological measurements at 96 hours were significantly worse in infants who subsequently developed chronic lung disease. Initial logistic regression showed that gestation, arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2), and ventilation rate at 96 hours; and birth in 1988 or 1989, were independently associated with chronic lung disease, but when septicaemia and use of lipid during the first 21 days were included, only gestational age (odds ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.49 to 0.81 for each week) and use of lipid (odds ratio 8.1, 95% CI, 2.32 to 28.0) remained significantly associated with chronic lung disease. The observed increase in incidence of chronic lung disease in this population was associated with earlier use of parenteral lipids in infants of very low gestation rather than with changes in population, survival, or ventilator treatment of respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

Continuous visualisation of the airway was possible and recorded on to videotape together with simultaneous cardiorespiratory monitoring to detect apnoeic episodes in 12 infants studied. In seven infants obstruction was observed at laryngeal level with the arytenoid masses and aryepiglottic folds closing across the vocal cords. This was not only observed in obstructive apnoea but also during mixed apnoea in periods where no respiratory effort was detectable and again in apparently pure central apnoea. The findings confirm the larynx as an anatomical site of upper airway obstruction. They agree with other indirect methods of assessing airway patency that obstruction has an important role in the pathophysiology of apnoea of prematurity.\r"

Pulmonary artery pressure was assessed noninvasively by its inverse relationship with the ratio of pulmonary artery Doppler time to peak velocity and right ventricular ejection time. The pattern of rise in ratio after the acute phase of hyaline membrane disease divided into three types. In 25 infants the ratio returned to the normal range: in 12 (group 1) at the same time as the fractional inspired oxygen fell below 0.5 and in 13 (group 2) after a delay of at least 24 hours. In 12 infants (group 3) the ratio remained below the normal range during their hospital stay, suggesting pulmonary artery pressure remained high. Infants in group 3 were of significantly lower gestation and required oxygen treatment for significantly longer than infants in groups 1 and 2. Persistently raised pulmonary pressures in group 3 may reflect lung damage either directly affecting pulmonary vasculature or exerting a secondary effect on pulmonary vascular resistance through hypoxaemia.\r"

Of the 19 morphologically normal fetuses, three died in utero and there were four neonatal or infant deaths. The mortality rate was 48% for all pregnancies and 37% for those with morphologically normal fetuses. There was a highly significant increased risk for the development of necrotising enterocolitis in these morphologically normal fetuses with AREDF (53%) compared with controls (6%) who did have umbilical artery end diastolic flow velocities in fetal life. There were no significant differences between the matched pairs for parameters of neonatal outcome chosen to reflect neonatal morbidity. These findings demonstrate the close association between AREDF and necrotising enterocolitis that appears to be independent of other variables such as degree of growth retardation, prematurity, and perinatal asphyxia.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of left internal mammary artery (LIMA) dissection and distal division on phrenic nerve perfusion and function were examined in an adult swine model. Phrenic nerve perfusion was determined by left atrial injection of radioactively labeled microspheres. Phrenic nerve function was determined by measuring nerve and diaphragm potentials evoked by bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation. In the first group of animals (n = 9), the LIMA was dissected with ligation of all its branches. Left phrenic nerve perfusion and function decreased after LIMA dissection in every animal studied, whereas only minimal changes were observed on the right. Sixty minutes after LIMA dissection, left phrenic nerve mean perfusion decreased 71%. Left phrenic nerve and left diaphragm mean action potential amplitudes decreased 54% and 80%, respectively. In the second group of animals (n = 4), the LIMA dissection was performed without division of the pericardiacophrenic artery, a small proximal branch of the internal mammary artery that supplies the phrenic nerve. Sixty minutes after LIMA dissection, left phrenic nerve perfusion had decreased by 21% from control values, with a corresponding decrease in left phrenic nerve and diaphragm mean action potential amplitudes of 19% and 23%, respectively. These results indicate that LIMA dissection with division of all its branches in this model is associated with a significant impairment in left phrenic nerve perfusion and function and suggests a causal relationship. These results may also explain the apparent increased phrenic nerve cold sensitivity and increased incidence of phrenic nerve dysfunction associated with LIMA grafting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

From 1987 to July 1990, 39 patients underwent total cavopulmonary anastomoses (group 1) and 39 patients underwent modified Fontan procedures (group 2); patients receiving adjustable atrial septal defects were excluded. Diagnoses in group 1 included tricuspid atresia in 5 patients, single ventricle in 32, and pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum in 2. Diagnoses in group 2 included tricuspid atresia in 20, single ventricle in 17, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in 1, and pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum in 1. There were no significant differences in age, weight, cross-clamp time, duration of inotropic support, postoperative effusions, or hospital stay between the two groups. Early mortality in group 1 was 7.7% (3/39) and in group 2, 2.6% (1/39). There was no difference in the incidence of early dysrhythmias or early pacemaker placement. Late mortality was 2.8% in group 1 and 8% in group 2 with a mean follow-up of 18 and 25 months, respectively. Follow-up in group 1 revealed 33 patients in normal sinus rhythm and 1 patient with episodes of supraventricular tachycardia; no additional patients have required pacemakers. Follow-up in group 2 revealed 27 patients in normal sinus rhythm and supraventricular tachycardia in 4 patients; 5 additional patients have required pacemaker placement. There is no apparent difference in early outcome between the total cavopulmonary anastomosis and the conventional modified Fontan. However, there appears to be an increased incidence of late dysrhythmias and the need for pacemaker placement in the conventional modified Fontan group compared with the lateral tunnel group.\r"

  ".W": "Resection of pulmonary metastases from soft tissue sarcoma has been shown to be associated with a 3-year survival of 25% to 30%. The role of multiple resections for recurrent pulmonary metastases, however, has not been clearly defined. Since 1976, 43 patients have had two or more thoracic explorations for the purpose of resecting pulmonary metastases from adult soft tissue sarcoma at our institution. In 89 reexplorations, through either median sternotomy or lateral thoracotomy, the operative mortality was 0%, and 31 of the 43 patients (72%) could be rendered free of disease at the second thoracotomy. Median survival from the second thoracotomy for the patients with resectable disease was 25 months, whereas median survival of patients who had unresectable disease was 10 months. A disease-free interval between the first and second thoracotomies of greater than 18 months was associated with prolonged survival from the second thoracotomy. Owing to lack of other therapies with proven salvage efficacy and in the absence of randomized trials, repeated thoracotomies to render patients free of disease from pulmonary soft-tissue sarcoma metastases appear justified considering the potential survival benefit and low attendant risk.\r"

Between 1981 and 1989, 56 patients (35 men and 21 women with a mean age of 49 years) had 65 pulmonary resections for histologically proven metastatic melanoma after treatment of the primary tumor. In patients undergoing thoracotomy, 50% (28/56) had pulmonary metastases as the initial site of recurrence. Twenty-eight patients (50%) had local-regional recurrence before the development of lung metastases. Eight lobectomies, two segmentectomies, and 55 wedge excisions were done. Fifty-four patients (54/56, 96%) underwent complete resection, and there were no operative deaths. The postthoracotomy actuarial survival was 25% at 5 years (median interval, 18 months). Location of the primary tumor, histology, thickness, Clark level, local-regional lymph node metastases, or type of resection was not associated with improved survival. Patients without regional nodal metastases before thoracotomy had a median survival of 30 months compared with 16 months for all others (p = 0.04). Patients with lung as the site of first recurrence had a median survival of 30 months compared with 17 months for patients with initial local-regional recurrence (p = 0.038, log-rank test). Despite systemic spread, patients with isolated pulmonary metastases from melanoma may benefit from metastasectomy.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the long-term safety of an immunosuppressive regimen without corticosteroids, we retrospectively evaluated 42 long-term (greater than 1 year) survivors of orthotopic cardiac transplantation. We determined the incidence of (1) conversion of the immunosuppressive regimen from cyclosporine and azathioprine alone (group I) to cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone (group II), (2) late acute graft rejection (defined as occurring at greater than 1 postoperative year), and (3) major postoperative complications related to corticosteroids. Of the 42 patients who were started on cyclosporine and azathioprine, 48% remained in group I, and 52% converted to group II. Forty-five percent of group II patients were able to taper and discontinue prednisone in 15.6 +/- 2.2 months. Among the patients on long-term corticosteroid-free immunosuppression, the incidence of late rejection was 2.1% per endomyocardial biopsy. The incidence of late infectious episodes was not significantly different between the two groups of patients, although diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia were more prevalent in group II than in group I. These data suggest that cardiac transplant recipients who chronically remain on corticosteroid-free immunosuppression represent a select group of patients with an acceptably low risk of late graft rejection and associated reduction of potential risk factors of accelerated coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective analysis of the records of 60 patients who underwent pericardiectomy over a 10-year period (1980 to 1990) at The Johns Hopkins Hospital was performed. Indications for operation were effusive disease in 24 patients and constriction in 36 patients. Six patients (10%) with pericardial effusion had pain as the primary symptom necessitating intervention. The operative approach for pericardiectomy was median sternotomy in 52 patients (4 patients required cardiopulmonary bypass) and left anterior thoracotomy in 8 patients. Nine patients (5 with constriction and 4 with effusion) with a prior limited pericardial procedure required formal pericardiectomy. The operative mortality rate for pericardial effusion and constriction was 4.2% and 5.6%, respectively. Follow-up (median follow-up, 56.9 +/- 38.2 months) was obtained on 56 patients (93.3%). Actuarial survival at 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years for all patients was 82.1% +/- 5.1%, 71.7% +/- 6.7%, and 59.8% +/- 12.2%, respectively. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed using 20 clinical variables. A history of malignancy, previous pericardial procedure, and preoperative New York Heart Association class IV were found to be predictors of poor survival. All patients who underwent operation primarily for effusion with associated pain are alive and have improved functional capacity without steroid use. We conclude that pericardiectomy can be performed with low mortality and can result in good long-term survival and improved functional capacity. Patients who are seen primarily with pain refractory to steroid therapy can be relieved of symptoms with operation.\r"

Cardiac catheterization data before CABG were available in 110 patients (56 received only saphenous vein grafts, 54 received at least one IMA graft), allowing comparison of left ventricular function at CABG and CABR. Injury of the IMA graft occurred in 5 patients (1 death), but presence of an IMA graft was not an independent predictor of morbidity or mortality. Overall, the incidences of complications and deaths were higher in patients with saphenous vein grafts than in patients with IMA grafts, though not significantly so. Internal mammary artery grafts better preserved cardiac function: patients with IMA grafts had worse left ventricular function before CABG but better left ventricular function before CABR than patients with saphenous vein grafts. Left ventricular function deterioration from before CABG to before CABR was significantly less in patients with IMA grafts. We conclude that the risk of CABR is not increased by a previously constructed IMA graft and that left ventricular function is better preserved at CABR when an IMA graft was constructed at the initial operation.\r"

A novel, rapid, overall test (hemostatometry) consisting of a physiologically relevant test of platelet function (shear-induced hemostasis) and coagulation was performed using nonanticoagulated blood and compared with the routine coagulation screen. Two hundred five patients undergoing elective coronary revascularization were studied 3 to 4 days before operation. Forty-nine bled excessively for nonsurgical reasons; none were predicted by the routine coagulation tests. Using a stepwise discriminant analysis, hemostatometry correctly predicted 31 of 49 (63%). Thirty of 156 predicted as bleeders by hemostatometry did not bleed. Thus, preoperative hemostatometry predicted 77% of the true outcome. The false predictions suggest, however, that certain bleeding abnormalities probably acquired during cardiopulmonary bypass cannot be predicted. These findings do not justify the routine use of preoperative tests in assessing the bleeding risk in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

This study examined the hypothesis that surface abrasion and topical application of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) would enhance omental revascularization of trachea in a rabbit heterotopic autograft model. Tracheal segments were excised, primary tracheal anastomoses performed, and the segments placed in the peritoneal cavity wrapped in omentum. Animals were randomized to one of six groups according to tracheal segment treatment: control, surgical abrasion, Surgicel wrap with topical bFGF, Surgicel wrap with bFGF vehicle, Gelfoam wrap with bFGF, and topical bFGF alone. One week later, animals were heparinized, perfused with Aquablak dye, and killed. Tracheal segments were excised and sectioned for light microscopic quantitative assessment of viability and dye perfusion. There was no significant improvement in viability or perfusion between abraded tracheal segments or segments treated with bFGF/Gelfoam or bFGF alone when compared with control segments. Airways wrapped in Surgicel had significantly greater ischemic injury compared with the control group, regardless of bFGF application. Neither surgical abrasion nor topical bFGF increased omental revascularization of transplanted tracheal segments after 7 days.\r"

  ".W": "Previous reports of elderly patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting have not addressed the current era of aggressive percutaneous angioplasty and frequent urgent or emergent operation. To investigate this important subgroup of patients, we analyzed our recent coronary artery bypass grafting experience with patients 70 years of age or older. From January 1984 to January 1989, 121 consecutive patients in this age range underwent surgical revascularization at our institution. Overall in-hospital operative mortality (OM) was 7.4% (9/121), with 77.8% (7/9) of deaths due to cardiac causes. Serious postoperative morbidity occurred in 71.1% (86/121). Surgical priority was significantly correlated with operative mortality: for elective cases, the OM was 2.9% (2/68), but it was 8.6% (3/35) for urgent cases (p less than 0.05) and 22.2% (4/18) for emergency cases (p less than 0.05). Univariate analysis isolated the need for inotropic support, intraaortic balloon pump, reoperation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and emergency status as significant risk factors for OM (p less than 0.05). Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis identified the need for inotropic support, intravenous nitroglycerin, reoperative coronary artery bypass grafting, and hypertension as independently significant risk factors. A logistic risk equation developed from this population accurately modeled OM at the extremes of operative risk. Three (3.1%) of the 97 patients predicted to have less than 5% OM died, whereas all patients predicted by the model to have greater than 90% OM died. These results indicate that in spite of relatively high morbidity and mortality rates, elderly patients have a very acceptable operative risk in the current era of high-risk coronary artery bypass grafting. This is particularly true if elective revascularization is possible.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective evaluation of 412 consecutive patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement between January 1982 and December 1985 was performed in an attempt to identify the determinants of survival and valve failure. A variety of valves were inserted to permit a prospective evaluation of alternative valves including: Bjork-Shiley mechanical (n = 37), Ionescu-Shiley pericardial (n = 261), Hancock pericardial (n = 78), and Carpentier-Edwards porcine (n = 36). Thirteen patients died in the hospital (3.2%) and 47 patients died in the follow-up period producing an actuarial survival of 81% +/- 3% at 48 months. Survival was independently predicted by advancing age, preoperative New York Heart Association functional class, and the presence of endocarditis (p less than 0.05 by Cox regression analysis). The majority of patients were symptomatically improved (New York Heart Association class I or II: 21% preoperative, 88% postoperative). Freedom from structural valve dysfunction, prosthetic valve endocarditis, and reoperation for valve-related complications were 95% +/- 2%, 95% +/- 2%, and 92% +/- 2% at 48 months, respectively. These valve-related complications occurred more frequently in younger patients and in those with a Hancock pericardial valve (freedom from structural valve dysfunction, 89% +/- 5%; prosthetic valve endocarditis, 84% +/- 9%; reoperation, 78% +/- 10%; p less than 0.05 by Cox regression). Freedom from thromboembolism was 88% +/- 2% at 48 months; it was significantly lower in patients with a preoperative thromboembolic event and was not influenced by the type of prosthesis inserted. Freedom from anticoagulant-related hemorrhage was 85% +/- 8% at 48 months and was not influenced by any preoperative factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
