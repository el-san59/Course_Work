  ".W": "Platelet regeneration time was assessed in 13 young adults with pulmonary hypertension and polycythemia secondary to congenital heart defects who underwent isovolemic hemodilution to improve clinical status and coagulation defects. The estimated platelet half-life in patients with Eisenmenger's complex was significantly shortened in comparison with normal subjects (3.8 +/- 1.9 vs 4.8 +/- 1.0 days, p less than 0.05). Hemodilution was carried out with no adverse effects, using low molecular weight dextran solutions. Lowering hematocrit from 61 to 50 percent resulted in a significant increase in platelet half-life from 3.8 +/- 1.9 to 5.7 +/- 1.8 days (p less than 0.02), which was followed by a marked rise in platelet count from 149 +/- 31 to 209 +/- 47 x 10(9) platelets/L (p less than 0.003). Arterial oxygen tension did not change significantly. These observations indicate that high hematocrit levels may have accounted for the shortened platelet survival and thrombocytopenia in these patients. Significant hemodilution may lead to a marked improvement in platelet abnormalities in patients with Eisenmenger's complex.\r"

The correlation coefficient (r) between SvO2 and ScvO2 in 179 simultaneously drawn blood samples from 22 dogs was 0.97. In another nine dogs, the two sites were continuously and simultaneously monitored with fiberoptic catheters; r was 0.96 with a mean difference of 3.7 +/- 2.9 percent (SD) saturation. In each dog the changes in ScvO2 closely paralleled the changes in SvO2. Although absolute values of ScvO2 are not sufficiently identical to SvO2 to calculate O2 uptake or pulmonary shunt precisely, close tracking of changes in the two sites across a wide range of hemodynamic conditions warrant further consideration of ScvO2 for patient monitoring of trends in O2 supply/demand.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of delivering He-O2 by open-circuit systems by measuring DD50 in five adult volunteers. The mean (+/- SD) DD50 with a nonrebreathing mask was 1.32 +/- 0.89, with a simple mask was 1.21 +/- 0.87, and with a nasal cannula was 1.00 +/- 0.13; the DD50 with the nonrebreathing mask and the simple mask was statistically greater than with the cannula (p less than 0.05). Two infant oxygen hoods were assessed by measuring the nitrogen concentration at different locations in the hoods. The N2 concentration increased progressively from top to bottom, indicating that the helium was concentrated at the top. We conclude that the nonrebreathing mask and simple masks are probably satisfactory He-O2 delivery systems, that the infant oxyhood may be suboptimal, and that the nasal cannula is ineffective.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to clarify whether azelastine, an antiasthmatic drug, could favorably alter bronchial responsiveness in patients with bronchial asthma. To estimate bronchial responsiveness, methacholine challenge was performed in 21 patients with bronchial asthma. After the first examination, all patients were treated for eight weeks with azelastine, 2 mg twice daily. After four and eight weeks' treatment, methacholine challenge was repeated. After eight weeks' treatment, Dmin, an index of bronchial sensitivity, was increased significantly, and after four weeks an insignificant increase was observed. The RrsC, SGrs/GrsC, indices of respiratory resistance and bronchial reactivity, respectively, did not change significantly during eight weeks' treatment. Recently various chemical transmitters, especially leukotrienes, were shown to be closely related to the genesis of bronchial asthma. Accordingly, the effect of azelastine observed here might be ascribed to its antagonizing action on leukotriene. Since bronchial hyperresponsiveness is a critical etiologic factor in bronchial asthma, long-term administration of azelastine might help to modify the disease's basic pathophysiologic conditions.\r"

A group of 250 dairy farmers was compared with 250 control subjects, matched with regard to sex, age, height, and smoking habits. The prevalence of acute bronchial infections and dyspnea was identical in the two groups. Among dairy farmers, 30 (12 percent) had chronic bronchitis vs 15 (6 percent) in the control group (p less than 0.05). Chronic bronchitis was more common in patients aged over 40 years (p less than 0.001) and in nonsmokers (p less than 0.001). All respiratory function parameters measured (expressed as a mean percentage of values measured in comparison with theoretic values) were lower in the dairy farmer group than in the control group. With regard to degree of bronchial obstruction, the difference between the two groups was more marked in patients aged 40 years and over and in nonsmokers. Dairy farmers' occupation is a risk factor of chronic bronchitis and bronchial obstruction, in particular in patients aged 40 years and over and in nonsmokers.\r"

A significant improvement after terbutaline treatment compared with placebo was observed in subjective assessments of breathlessness after two of the activities of daily living, and in daily peak flow measurements recorded in patient diaries. At the clinical assessment after five weeks' terbutaline therapy, 12 of 17 patients had improved pulmonary symptom scores compared with placebo, and a slight increase in FEV1 was observed relative to placebo (0.09 L, p less than 0.05). Thus, five weeks' treatment with oral terbutaline in patients with CAL resulted in significant improvements in several subjective assessments, despite a lack of effect on the majority of the objective variables.\r"

Controls consisted of 478 healthy Japanese subjects. The frequencies of HLA-A1, HLA-Bw46, HLA-Cx46, HLA-DRw8, HLA-DRw9, and HLA-DRw52 were significantly increased in sarcoidosis compared to control subjects, but only four patients were positive for HLA-A1. Increased frequencies of HLA-Bw46 and HLA-Cx46 were thought to be attributable to linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DRw8. Patients with HLA-DRw52 were the most frequent (84 cases of 113). No significant differences were observed between HLA-DRw52-positive and HLA-DRw52-negative patients in their clinical features, but all of the patients with muscular involvement (six cases) were positive for HLA-DRw52. Among patients positive for HLA-DRw52, those with HLA-DR5 showed a significantly better clinical course and earlier onset of the disease than those with HLA-DRw8. These results suggest that HLA antigens may play an important role in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis.\r"

When standardized for the amount of total protein recovered (SIgA/TP, IgG/TP), bronchial washings recovered from the uninvolved lung of lung cancer patients demonstrated a significantly decreased SIgA/TP ratio compared to control subjects (.14 +/- .02 vs .31 +/- .05, SEM, p less than 0.05). There were no differences in the IgG/TP ratios. Lung cancer patients with a decreased serum albumin (less than 3.2 g/dl) had a significantly decreased SIgA/TP ratio in bronchial washings compared to patients with a higher serum albumin (.08 +/- .03 vs .18 +/- .04, SEM, p less than 0.05). The decreased relative concentration of airway SIgA in lung cancer patients may adversely affect airway defenses against bacterial colonization.\r"

Hutterite males and females showed significant age-dependent increases of both weight and obesity (p less than 0.001) not seen in the control group. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SP and DP) of the Hutterites were higher than those of the control subjects (p less than 0.001). There were highly significant correlations between age, weight, obesity (all p less than 0.001), and SP and DP of the Hutterites. Correlations between the weight and SP and DP were significant (p less than 0.001) in the control groups. The prevalence of systolic blood pressures greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg among Hutterite males ranged from 34.6 to 79.3 percent in age groups by decade vs 8.7 to 34.2 percent in age-matched control males. The prevalence of diastolic blood pressure levels greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg ranged from 0 percent in the youngest (less than or equal to 29 years) to 7.9 percent oldest age group (60+ years) of control males. The prevalence of elevated DP among male Hutterites ranged from 5.9 to 37.9 percent in corresponding age groups. A similar age-dependent trend of prevalence rates of elevated DP and SP were noted in female Hutterites but to a lesser extent than in control subjects. Elevated blood pressure levels among Hutterites may be an important contributing risk factor to the younger mean age of death of Hutterites compared to the control population.\r"

She was diagnosed as having myocardial infarction on the basis of typical changes in electrocardiograms and serum enzymes (CPK, SGOT and LDH). The diagnosis of type 4 Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was made by the microscopic examination of her connective tissue. Patient 2 was a 32-year-old man. He was also diagnosed as having acute myocardial infarction. His fibroblasts were cultured and they could not synthesize type 3 collagen. Type 4 Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was diagnosed.

Lipid infusion precipitated a significant reduction in PaO2/FIO2 from 241 +/- 50 to 184 +/- 41 (mean +/- SD) and increased MPAP from 26.0 +/- 5.1 to 31.8 +/- 4.8 mm Hg, pulmonary vascular resistance from 149 +/- 78 to 179 +/- 61 dyne.s/cm5 and pulmonary venous admixture (Qva/Qt) from 20.7 +/- 15.2 to 30.6 +/- 8.6 percent. Further analysis revealed that the magnitude of increased Qva/Qt was greater in patients who manifested septicemia (N = 10) compared to those who did not (N = 9): 12.3 vs 7.3 percent, respectively. We conclude that intravenous lipid administration was associated with increased MPAP and Qva/Qt in patients with ARDS, particularly when accompanied by septicemia. Although these alterations resolved after the lipid infusion was terminated, we suggest that prudent measures should be taken to guarantee adequate oxygenation during intravenous fat emulsion therapy in patients suffering from ARDS.\r"

Standard hemodynamic measurements were obtained and RV performance assessed before and 1 h after the start of the infusion. All but one patient had pulmonary hypertension, and in seven the RV ejection fraction (RVEF) was lower than 50 percent at baseline. Drugs were titrated to a systolic arterial blood pressure of mean 106 +/- 18 mm Hg for dopamine and 116 +/- 20 mm Hg for norepinephrine (NS). Dopamine infusion increased the cardiac index (CI) 16 percent (p less than 0.02), but heart rate and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were unchanged. With norepinephrine CI was unchanged, a heart rate decreased 7 percent (p less than 0.05), and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance increased 35 and 26 percent, respectively (p less than 0.05). With both drugs, RV volumes and RVEF remained unchanged, and systemic oxygen consumption increased equally (by 19 percent for dopamine and 22 percent for norepinephrine, p less than 0.05); systemic oxygen delivery rose by 17 percent during dopamine infusion and was unchanged during norepinephrine infusion. Norepinephrine increased oxygen extraction vs dopamine (p less than 0.05). There were no differences in urinary output. Norepinephrine may improve the RV oxygen supply/demand ratio, but this potentially beneficial effect on RV ejection fraction may be offset by a concomitant increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and RV afterload. Norepinephrine may not adversely affect the peripheral circulation. In short-term treatment of volume-resuscitated, severe septic shock complicated by pulmonary hypertension and impaired RV performance, norepinephrine may be at least as effective as dopamine.\r"

The lack of correlation in group 2 was due to a drug-dependent increase in oxygen consumption (VO2) +18 percent vs -3 percent in group 1 (p less than 0.05) associated with a lack of increase in PvO2 +3 percent vs +14 percent in group 1 (p less than 0.05) despite a similar increase in oxygen availability +19 percent versus +16 percent. It was concluded that (1) a correlation between CI and SvO2 is not found in every patient with CHF; (2) the lack of correlation in four out of our ten patients was due to an associated and significant increase in CI and VO2 in group 2; (3) group 2 patients probably had an important oxygen debt before treatment; (4) SvO2 cannot be used instead of CI to determine the hemodynamic consequences of the use of cardiovascular drugs.\r"

Therapeutic blood levels after loading dose were obtained in 13 of the 14 patients. Measured volume of distribution, serum half-life, and elimination rate constant were significantly different from values calculated by using standard formulae. All the patients tolerated the dose well without significant deterioration in renal function. Based on the present study, we conclude that administration of 3 mg/kg body weight loading dose of gentamicin or tobramycin in critically ill patients with sepsis would result in earlier therapeutic drug levels.\r"

Forty percent of the patients were judged to have psychiatric disorders at the time of assessment. All patients had very high levels of denial and following the NMAD, patients appeared to either decompensate psychiatrically, usually exhibiting symptoms of anxiety disorders, or further increase their levels of denial. Those patients who had psychiatric illnesses at the time of the study were more constitutionally vulnerable towards developing these disorders and had a reduced perception of their quality of life compared with the patients who increased their levels of denial following the NMAD. The effects of the NMAD on patients and their families ranged from mutual anger and anxiety, although the anger was often repressed, to mutual overinvolvement and overdependence. The presence of high levels of denial of asthma and a history of psychiatric illness in the patient appear to be factors that may increase the likelihood of death from asthma.\r"

The effects of an infusion of norepinephrine, titrated to specific end points, were recorded before embolization and at two levels of pulmonary hypertension. Simultaneous measurements of systemic and renal hemodynamics were made. Sequential blood clot injection increased (p less than .01) pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) from 1.3 to 13 to 33 mm Hg.L-1.min and reduced CO 45 percent and 75 percent (p less than .01). Norepinephrine increased both stroke volume and CO (p less than .01) in each condition and did not increase PVR. Since the biventricular filling pressures remained constant or fell slightly with norepinephrine, the increase in CO is best explained by an improvement in pump performance. There was no deterioration in renal blood flow or creatinine clearance with norepinephrine. The data suggested that in this model of right ventricular dysfunction, norepinephrine consistently improved myocardial performance without provoking further vasoconstriction in either the pulmonary or renal circulations.\r"

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of SP on the GB and sphincter of Oddi (SOD) of dogs in vitro, to evaluate the structure-activity relationship of SP, and to compare the contractile effect of SP with that of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) and acetylcholine (Ach). Isolated longitudinal strips of GB and SOD from dogs were suspended in oxygenated Krebs buffer and the isometric tension responses to various doses of CCK-8, Ach, SP, and SP homologs [SP-free acid (SPFA), Octa-SP (O-SP), physalaemin (PHY)] were measured. We found that all the SP homologs, other than SPFA, stimulated GB and SOD contractions in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. The potency of SP and its homologs on GB and SOD was SP greater than or equal to PHY greater than O-SP; SPFA was without effect. CCK-8 was significantly more effective than SP on GB contraction, but unlike SP, CCK had no effect on SOD. The maximum contraction achieved by Ach was 1.3 (SOD) to 2.3 (GB) times greater than that achieved by SP, but the ED50 of SP was approximately 100- to 200-fold lower than that of Ach. The contractile effect of SP was partially blocked by 10(-5) M atropine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood was drawn immediately prior to each surgical procedure and at specified time points postoperatively. Compared to hormone levels found prior to surgery, following major hepatic resection, estradiol levels increase at 24 and 48 hr, while testosterone levels decline, being significantly reduced at 96 and 144 hr. These data demonstrate that adult males who undergo a 40-60% partial hepatectomy experience alterations in their sex hormone levels similar to those observed in male rats following a 70% hepatectomy. These changes in sex hormone levels have been associated in animals with an alteration of the sex hormone receptor status of the liver that is thought to participate in the initiation of the regenerative response. These studies suggest, but do not prove, that in man, as in the case of the rat, sex hormones may participate in the initiation of or at least modulate in part the regenerative response that occurs following a major hepatic resection.\r"

Basal secretions were not significantly different between young and old rats. BPJ diversion significantly stimulated pancreatic secretions of fluid, bicarbonate, and protein in all animals. The pancreatic protein response (mg/kg/hr) to BPJ diversion was significantly attenuated with respect to age [57.59 +/- 16.16, 43.73 +/- 6.94, and 20.75 +/- 3.95, for 6-, 12-, 24- to 26-month-old rats, respectively, mean +/- SE, F(2,20) = 3.49, P less than 0.05]. The pancreatic responses to secretin (0.086, 0.432, and 1.728 nmol/kg) were not significantly different between young and old rats. Intravenous injection of CCK-8 (0.033, 0.167, and 0.667 nmol/kg) produced a significant increase in protein output in all age groups. In young animals, stepwise increases in protein output were observed, whereas, in old rats, increments in response to the larger two doses of CCK-8 (0.167 and 0.667 nmol) were smaller than that produced by 0.033 nmol/kg of CCK-8. In conclusion, the basal secretions in old rats were comparable with those in young ones, but the reserve capacity for protein secretion appears to decrease in old compared to young rats.\r"

We used specific and potent CCK-receptor antagonist, L-364,718, administered intravenously in a dose of 0.5 mumol/kg or intraduodenally in a dose of 2 mumol/kg to assess the role of CCK in the release of PP. Exogenous CCK-8 infused intravenously in gradually increasing doses (12.5-400 pmol/kg/hr) caused a dose-dependent increase in plasma PP from basal 28 +/- 4 pM to 136 +/- 18 pM, and this PP increase was completely suppressed by both intravenous and intraduodenal administration of L-364,718. Meat feeding caused a dramatic increase in plasma PP from a basal level of 26 +/- 4 pM to a peak of about 190 +/- 32 pM, and the pretreatment with intravenous or intraduodenal L-364,718 reduced this PP increase by about 60%. Duodenal perfusion with oleate (0.12-4.0 mmol/hr) or L-Trp (0.12-4.0 mmol/hr) also increased plasma PP, reaching, respectively, 180 +/- 28 pM and 76 +/- 6 pM. Pretreatment with intravenous or intraduodenal L-364,718 completely abolished the plasma PP responses to oleate and L-Trp. Bombesin (100 pmol/kg/hr) raised plasma PP to the level similar to that achieved by meat feeding and L-364,718 given intravenously or intraduodenally blocked completely these plasma PP increments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined the inhibitory effects of loxiglumide on pancreatic exocrine function in the isolated pancreatic acini and the isolated perfused pancreata of rats. Loxiglumide inhibited cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8)-stimulated amylase release and, similarly, binding of [125I]CCK-8 to isolated rat pancreatic acini. Loxiglumide was about 3000 times more potent than the reference substance proglumide, but was about 1000 times less potent than L-364,718, another new CCK antagonist having benzodiazepine ring, in inhibiting CCK-8-stimulated amylase release. The inhibitory effect of loxiglumide displayed competitive kinetics and was specific for CCK in that the effects of other receptor secretagogues or agents bypassing receptors were not altered. The inhibitory effect of loxiglumide was fully reversible in isolated acini. However, the pancreata perfused with 10 microM loxiglumide for 20 min did not respond to CCK-8 for more than 20 min even after the removal of loxiglumide infusion. In contrast, an immediate increase in pancreatic exocrine secretion was observed after proglumide removal. Loxiglumide appeared to be bound to the receptors on acinar cells in a slowly dissociating state. These results indicate that loxiglumide acts as a potent, competitive, and specific CCK antagonist on the exocrine pancreas and, because of its prolonged inhibitory action, may be useful as a therapeutic agent in pancreatic disease.\r"

  ".W": "The viscerovisceral reflex control of gastric tone remains poorly characterized. We have previously demonstrated physiological variations in gastric tone that occur during fasting and after feeding. These variations are neurally regulated. We have now compared the reflex mechanisms modulating gastric tone that are elicited by esophageal or duodenal distension in fasted, conscious dogs. To determine the pathways involved in these reflexes, we combined the technique of vagal blockade (by cooling the supradiaphragmatic vagi isolated within a surgically implanted cooling jacket) with the administration of autonomic drugs. Gastric tone was measured as the air volume within an intragastric bag maintained at a constant, low pressure by an electronic barostat. Standardized distensions were performed by means of an inflatable balloon-catheter positioned either in the mid-esophagus (in three dogs) or in the distal duodenum (in three dogs). A profound and consistent gastric relaxation was induced by distension of either the esophagus (247 +/- 21 ml delta volume, P less than 0.05) or the duodenum (238 +/- 29 ml, P less than 0.05). Supradiaphragmatic vagal cooling abolished the gastric relaxatory response to duodenal distension and significantly reduced, but did not completely suppress, the response to esophageal distension. Neither cholinergic stimulation (intravenous bethanechol) nor adrenergic blockade (combined intravenous phentolamine and propranolol) had any significant effect on either gastric relaxatory response. Combined adrenergic and cholinergic (intravenous atropine) blockade induced gastric relaxation, but failed to suppress the gastric responses. We conclude that both esophageal and duodenal distension elicit gastric relaxation by a noncholinergic vagal mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pathologic characteristics of this entity were defined retrospectively, by studying endoscopic pinch biopsy slides from these seven patients and antrectomy specimens from five patients. A scoring system was developed, and the seven patients were compared prospectively with various control groups. Abnormalities of mucosal vessels (fibrin thrombi and/or ectasia) consistently distinguished patients from control antrectomies, normal biopsies, acute gastritis biopsies and atrophic gastritis biopsies (P = 0.02, all comparisons). Spindle cell proliferation into mucosa also was characteristic of gastric antral vascular ectasia, distinguishing this disease from normals, acute gastritis, and atrophic gastritis (P less than or equal to 0.039, each comparison). The presence of abnormal mucosal vessels (fibrin thrombi and/or ectasia) and spindle cell proliferation was similar in patient antrectomies compared to patient endoscopic biopsies. Therefore, we conclude that endoscopic biopsies can reliably diagnose gastric antral vascular ectasia, a vascular disorder characterized by abnormal mucosal vessels and spindle cell proliferation.\r"

In general, the number of polyps per patient was less in older patients. Histologically, all these polyps were formed of cystically dilated oxyntic glands and irregularly deformed oxyntic glands. Chromoendoscopic examinations using Congo red showed that the polyps were associated with extensive acid-secreting areas, were all located in acid-secreting areas, and had an acid-secreting function. Colonoscopy and/or radiologic examinations showed that one or a few polyps were frequently also present in the colons of these patients, but none of the families of the patients had a history of gastrointestinal polyposis. One to 11 years after the initial endoscopy, in seven (50.0%) of 14 patients with hamartomatous polyps followed up, the number of polyps decreased significantly.\r"

  ".W": "Even though rabbit gastric glands are a commonly used model for the study of gastric physiology, little is known about the secretion of gastric acid in the rabbit in vivo. Gastric acid secretion in response to pentagastrin, histamine, and bethanechol stimulation, and the effect of specific cholinergic and histamine H2-receptor blockers was studied in 62 urethane-anesthetized rabbits. Additionally, the responses of eight conscious rabbits prepared with chronic gastric fistula were compared with similarly prepared conscious dogs (n = 10) and conscious rats (n = 18). In anesthetized rabbits, maximal pentagastrin stimulation resulted in acid outputs only 22% that of maximal histamine stimulation, but this was enhanced by restoring cholinergic tone with a subthreshold infusion of bethanechol. In conscious rabbits, pentagastrin was an effective stimulant, resulting in maximal acid output 70% that of maximal histamine stimulation. This is in contrast to the in vitro findings reported reported by others utilizing isolated gastric glands and cells. Histamine was a potent stimulant of acid secretion in both the anesthetized and conscious rabbit, an observation that parallels the in vitro findings. Unlike the dog and rat, atropine was ineffective as an inhibitor of histamine-stimulated acid secretion in the conscious rabbit, although it was marginally effective against histamine in anesthetized rabbits and against pentagastrin in conscious rabbits. It is concluded that cholinergic tone plays a crucial role in pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion in the rabbit. This may be an explanation for the poor response to pentagastrin described in isolated rabbit gastric gland preparations.\r"

In this study we evaluated the radionuclide esophageal transit test in 49 consecutive patients undergoing esophageal manometry for esophageal motor disorders. Esophageal transit was assessed using a 10-ml water bolus labeled with 250 microCi technetium-99m sulfur colloid. In preliminary studies in 14 healthy controls, mean transit time was 9.6 +/- 2.1 (SD) sec. Prolonged transit (greater than 15 sec) was observed in two of 28 swallow sequences in the control subjects. Transit times were prolonged in all patients with achalasia or diffuse esophageal spasm, and in five of seven patients with nonspecific abnormalities of peristaltic progression. The test was abnormal in only three of seven patients with high-amplitude peristalsis (nutcracker esophagus) and in none of three patients with hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter. Additionally, prolonged transit was seen in two of 18 patients with normal manometry. We conclude that the radionuclide transit test using a liquid bolus successfully identifies motor disorders characterized by defective peristaltic progression but not disorders in which peristalsis is intact. A major limiting factor appears to be the small number of swallow sequences tested. The test may not, therefore, be accurate enough to consider adopting as a sensitive and noninvasive screening test in the evaluation of patients with suspected esophageal motor disorders.\r"

The primary purpose of this study was to culture and identify mycobacteria from the intestines of patients with CD and other intestinal diseases (control tissues). The culture methods were designed to eliminate most rapid-growing mycobacteria and to enhance the isolation of slow growing mycobacteria. Eighty-two surgically resected intestinal tissue samples were cultured over a four-year period: 27 tissues were from CD patients and 55 from patients with other intestinal diseases. After 4-12 months of culture, five mycobacteria were isolated, but only two have been identified thus far. Both of these organisms appeared to have initially grown as spheroplasts, but revertant bacteria were cultivated after transfer into fresh media. Four of the mycobacteria were from CD tissues, and one isolate was from a control tissue. Two of the isolates have been identified as M. chelonei subsp. abscessus, strain 390 and M. paratuberculosis strain 410. This M. paratuberculosis is similar to the previously identified M. paratuberculosis strains isolated from other human intestinal tissues from patients with CD. Both strains 390 and 410 were inoculated into neonatal goats, but they failed to reproduce a CD-like disease. The isolation of four mycobacteria from 27 CD tissues and only one from 55 control tissues strengthens the findings of previous investigators and supports the hypothesis that mycobacteria may be etiologically associated with some cases of Crohn's disease.\r"

The relationship between cholangiocarcinoma and MBDH was studied histologically by the use of an immunoperoxidase technique for cytokeratin. MBDH was strongly positive for cytokeratin, while the neoplasm showed this to a lesser extent, but a clear continuity between the MBDH epithelial cells and those of the neoplasm was demonstrated by the use of this technic. The potential use for the various cytokeratins in the differentiation of primary from secondary liver tumors, is discussed. This differentiation is a significant problem to the pathologist. Although cholangiocarcinoma may, on occasion, be associated with various congenital lesions of the bile ducts, the association with MBDH is extremely rare, this being only the third reported case.\r"

With univariate analysis, skin thickness was increased and significantly related to duration of diabetes (P less than .001), previous glycemic control (P less than .001), retinopathy (P less than .001), cheiroarthropathy (P less than .001), and vibration-perception threshold (P less than .05). There was a negative correlation between forced expiratory volume at 1 s (P less than .05) and vital capacity (P less than .05) with duration of diabetes. Neither skin thickness nor ankle arteriomedial wall calcification correlated with abnormal autonomic function tests. When corrected for duration of diabetes, there was a weak correlation between skin thickness and glycemic control (P less than .05) but no correlation with retinopathy, cheiroarthropathy, and vibration-perception threshold. This study confirms that there are widespread connective tissue changes in diabetes mellitus, although the biochemistry needs further elucidation.\r"

  ".W": "With new diabetes diet guidelines recommending high carbohydrate intake, questions arise regarding acceptable intake of simple sugars. Whereas several short-term studies report flattened glycemic and insulin response to fructose consumption, some also report increased serum triglyceride levels. Few studies examine the effects of long-term fructose consumption. We evaluated the long-term safety of fructose consumption in 14 middle-aged men with diabetes. Subjects followed an ambulatory high-fiber high-carbohydrate control diet at home for 8 wk, entered the hospital for 5 days on this diet, and spent the next 7 days on a similar diet supplemented with 50-60 g fructose. They continued the fructose diet at home for 23 wk, then resumed a postcontrol diet for an additional 16 wk. In the hospital, glycemic control improved significantly on the fructose-supplemented diet compared with the hospital control diet. In the ambulatory setting, no significant differences in plasma glucose, glycohemoglobin, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, lactate, or urate occurred between precontrol, fructose, or postcontrol periods. Fasting serum lactate was higher by 0.5 meq/L during the ambulatory fructose period than during the precontrol period. Body weight also increased during the ambulatory fructose period due to higher calorie intake. Adherence to fructose consumption was excellent and improved adherence to carbohydrate and fat recommendations. If total calorie intake is controlled to promote desirable body weight, crystalline fructose used with a high-carbohydrate high-fiber low-fat diet appears to be safe and acceptable for diabetic individuals.\r"

Twenty-nine adolescent subjects (experimental) with IDDM were randomly assigned the Glucometer M system for 4 mo. Twenty-eight control subjects used meters without memory. All subjects returned twice to the clinic at 2-mo intervals during the study. At clinic visits, both groups reviewed their SMBG data with their physician. Reviews on experimental subjects were conducted with computer-generated data formats. Control subject reviews used traditional logbooks. Both groups showed a significant drop in glycosylated hemoglobin during the study period (P less than .001); however, there were no between-group differences. There were also no differences in SMBG testing behavior or self-reported regimen self-adjustment between groups or within groups compared with baseline. Compared with control subjects, experimental subjects indicated a significant increase in self-reported understanding of IDDM treatment (P = .002), perceived importance of testing (P = .006), and the quality of interaction with their physician (P less than .001). These data suggest that use of computer-assisted SMBG systems in the outpatient setting does not improve metabolic control over 4 mo. It may, however, contribute to improving communication between the patient and health-care providers.\r"

The Diabetes: Basic Knowledge Test (DBKT; Cronbach's alpha = .79) was used to measure the actual level of knowledge of diabetes mellitus. The data were analyzed with Pearson's correlation coefficients. A moderately low negative correlation (r = -.36, P less than .001) indicated that the staff nurses' perceived knowledge of diabetes mellitus was inversely related to actual knowledge. Subjects were found to have a mean score of 64% on the DBKT. Study findings raise questions as to the adequacy of staff nurse knowledge of diabetes and the ability of staff nurses to assess themselves for knowledge deficits.\r"

Subjects consumed a mean of 4.8 bars/day. Average guar gum consumption at the end of the study was 31.7 g/day. One week before and at the end of the study, subjects were admitted to a metabolic ward and fed a controlled diet similar to their self-selected diet. Food, feces, and urine were composited for analysis of iron, zinc, copper, calcium, magnesium, and manganese. Eight subjects consuming the guar gum supplement and 6 subjects consuming the placebo bar completed collections for mineral balance. Neither consumption of guar gum nor placebo bar significantly changed apparent mineral balance for iron, copper, zinc, calcium, manganese, or magnesium from prestudy levels to 6-mo levels, and no significant differences were observed between the two groups. With the exception of copper, men consumed significantly more minerals than women. We conclude that consumption of guar gum by patients with NIDDM does not adversely affect apparent mineral balance.\r"

Ten days after hormone pellet removal, the animals were treated with 10 micrograms/kg estradiol, and the nuclear estrogen receptor (ERn) profile was assessed by the exchange assay. The pattern in the tumors was qualitatively similar to that in the uterus. A bimodal pattern of ERn was seen, with peaks at 1 and 8 h. Further biochemical analysis of uterine samples showed that both peaks were comprised of similar levels of salt-resistant ERn forms. Scatchard plot analysis of estradiol binding demonstrated high affinity receptors (Kd = 0.73-0.86 nM) as components of both peaks. In the ovariectomized adult rat there was also a bimodal pattern of ERn 1 and 13-14 h after the injection of 20 micrograms/kg estradiol. Direct hormone stimulation of the uterus was achieved with intraluminal (IL) injection of estradiol. IL injections of estradiol (100-800 pg/horn) stimulated uterine DNA synthesis compared to IL saline injections in the contralateral horn. IL injection of 200 pg/horn estradiol resulted in a bimodal pattern of ERn at 3 and 9 h. These data indicate that a bimodal pattern of ERn is present in estrogen target tissues exhibiting a growth response.\r"

Pituitaries collected from 3-week to 6-month-old male rats, and those from 3-week-old females showed negligible enzyme activities. The enzyme activity of female pituitaries increased markedly by 2 months, and even further by 6 months of age. Measurements of the enzyme activity around the estrous cycle revealed its characteristic change, being high in the proestrus and estrus, and low in the metestrus and diestrus. These changes of the enzyme activity were shown to reflect changes of the actual amount of a single type of peptidylarginine deiminase by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyses using an antiserum raised to an enzyme sample purified from rat skeletal muscle. The amount of pituitary enzyme was impoverished by ovariectomy. Repeated injections of 17 beta-estradiol to ovariectomized rats substantially restored the pituitary enzyme level. The above data suggest involvement of peptidylarginine deiminase in the female pituitary function.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo intraovarian synthesis of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) has been studied in the rat by Northern blot, dot blot hybridization, and in situ hybridization histochemistry. Ovarian IGF-I mRNA transcript sizes (7.0 kilobases (kb), 1.6 kb, and a group from 0.4-0.9 kb) were similar to those in liver and other tissues. The proportion of ovarian IGF-I to tubulin messenger RNA (mRNA) was increased to 176% of control values by treatment with diethylstilbestrol, while the ratio in liver was decreased to 64.4%. In situ hybridization identifies the major in vivo site of IGF-I synthesis in the ovary as the granulosa cells of developing follicles. IGF-I mRNA was present in the granulosa cells of developing preantral and antral follicles, but was not seen in atretic follicles or corpora lutea. In preovulatory follicles high levels of IGF-I mRNA were confined to the antral cell layers and to the cells of the cumulus oophorus. High levels of tubulin gene expression within follicles were seen in a similar distribution to that for IGF-I but 80-90% of corpora lutea also strongly expressed the tubulin gene. Interstitial cells, including thecal cells, express the tubulin gene at low levels but do not express the IGF-I gene. The distribution of IGF-I mRNA is the same as that previously observed for mitotically active granulosa cells, and therefore offers strong support for the view that IGF-I in the ovary acts by an autocrine-paracrine mechanism to promote granulosa cell replication.\r"

  ".U": "89251435\r", 
  ".W": "5 alpha-Androstane-3 beta,17 beta-diol hydroxylase (3 beta-diol OHase), a form of cytochrome P-450 whose main function is thought to be the elimination of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from its target tissues, was found in the central nervous system (CNS) of both male and female rats at a level which is at least 300-fold higher than any other P-450 catalyzed steroid hydroxylase in the brain. In order to gain some insight into the physiological function of this enzyme we have studied its distribution throughout the CNS as well as the effects of age and hormonal manipulations of rats. We have also partially purified the enzyme from the brain and compared it with the 3 beta-diol OHase in the prostate. 3 beta-Diol OHase activity was distributed throughout the CNS of adult male and female rats with levels between 70-153 nmol products formed/g tissue.h. The products were identified as 5 alpha-androstane-3 beta,7 beta,17 beta-triol,5 alpha-androstane-3 beta,6 alpha,17 beta-triol and 5 alpha-androstane-3 beta,7 alpha,17 beta-triol. The ratio of these three triols was 1:9:3. Catalytic activity was not affected by castration or adrenalectomy of male rats, or during late pregnancy or lactation in females. In the brains of 14-day-old fetuses and 2-day-old rats, the level of 3 beta-diol OHase was 30% of that of adults and it increased to adult levels by day 28. Cytochrome P-450 was partially purified from microsomes of whole brain, hypothalamus, and prostate and 3 beta-diol OHase activity reconstituted. On the basis of the ratios of the three triols formed from 3 beta-diol, it can be concluded that the 3 beta-diol OHase in the brain is similar to that in the prostate. From a comparison of the turnover numbers in reconstituted systems with P-450 prepared from the prostate, brain, and hypothalamus, it can be estimated that up to 50% of the P-450 in the hypothalamus and 10% in whole brain is 3 beta-diol OHase. Supportive evidence for this relative distribution of 3 beta-diol OHase in the hypothalamus was obtained by comparing the sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoretic profiles of P-450 obtained from the hypothalamus and prostate microsomes.\r"

In order to clarify further the mechanism of the antibody action, we studied the relationship with alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic and adenosine A1 receptors. FRTL-5 cells did not bind [3H]clonidine, suggesting the lack of alpha 2-adrenergic receptor or at least abnormality of its binding domain. On the other hand, the cells specifically bound [125I]iodocyanopindolol, but isoproterenol failed to affect the basal and TSH-stimulated cAMP production indicating the lack of coupling with adenylate cyclase. The inhibition of cAMP production induced by anti-fucosyl GM1 antibody was not altered by adrenergic agents. [125I]hydroxyphenylisopropyl adenosine binding was observed in FRTL-5 cells but was not displaced by the antibody. These results lead to conclusions that FRTL-5 cells lack alpha 2-adrenergic receptor but have beta-adrenergic receptor which lacks coupling with adenylate cyclase and have adenosine A1 receptor, and that the adrenergic receptors and adenosine A1 receptor are not the site of action of anti-fucosyl GM1 antibody.\r"

  ".U": "89251437\r", 
  ".W": "The current study was designed to investigate the actions of the testicular paracrine factor P-Mod-S on Sertoli cell function and differentiation. Transferrin production by Sertoli cells was stimulated by P-Mod-S to a greater extent than any individual regulatory agent and in a manner similar to a combination of FSH, insulin, retinol, and testosterone (FIRT). P-Mod-S had an additive response in combination with FIRT. The increase in transferrin production with a combination of P-Mod-S and FIRT is the highest level of stimulation (up to 8-fold) observed. These profound effects of P-Mod-S on Sertoli cell function implied a potential unique mechanism of action for the paracrine factor. FSH and FIRT significantly stimulated cAMP levels with both 60-min and 72-h treatments. In contrast, P-Mod-S had no effect on cAMP levels with a 60-min treatment and only a small increase with a 72-h treatment. Interestingly, P-Mod-S stimulated cGMP levels that remained above basal levels up to 72 h of treatment. FSH had no effect on cGMP levels. P-Mod-S did not affect inositol phosphate hydrolysis with treatments between 15 and 60 min. The actions of P-Mod-S on cGMP levels influenced Sertoli cell function on a molecular level. Northern blot analysis indicated that P-Mod-S and FIRT both stimulated the apparent levels of the 2.6-kilobase transcript of transferrin and the 1.7-kilobase transcript of androgen-binding protein. A solution hybridization procedure was used to quantitate the influence of P-Mod-S on Sertoli cell gene expression. P-Mod-S stimulated steady state levels of both transferrin and androgen-binding protein message approximately 2-fold, similar to the effects of FIRT. Both forms of P-Mod-S had similar biological activities and mechanisms of action. P-Mod-S (A) and P-Mod-S (B) both stimulated cGMP, altered Sertoli cell gene expression, and had profound effects on transferrin production. Although slightly different biochemically, both forms of P-Mod-S appear to be functionally similar. Combined observations indicate that the paracrine factor produced by peritubular cells, P-Mod-S, acts on Sertoli cells in part through a cGMP-mediated response to influence the expression of specific genes which subsequently have profound effects on Sertoli cell function and differentiation.\r"

The alpha-amidating enzyme activity was partially purified using a combination of weak anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Subsequent strong anion exchange chromatography at pH 6.0 resolved this partially pure enzyme into four distinct peaks of activity, termed Ia, Ib, II, and III. Peaks Ia and Ib exhibited broad pH optima between pH 6.0-8.5, whereas peaks II and III both exhibited pH optima at approximately pH 5.0. The peak III activity was further purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using hydrophobic interactive chromatography followed by strong anion exchange chromatography at pH 8.0. The enzyme exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 75K, a pH optimum of approximately pH 5.0, and a maximal turnover number of 580 min-1 in the presence of L-ascorbate. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the enzyme probably functions through a ping-pong mechanism with respect to the binding of the glycine-extended peptide substrate and the L-ascorbate cofactor. The peak III enzyme exhibits several distinctive characteristics compared to amidating enzymes isolated and characterized by other laboratories.\r"

  ".U": "89251440\r", 
  ".W": "Solution hybridization/RNase protection assays were used to study the developmental expression of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) mRNA levels in rats. In liver, heart, and kidney, total IGF-I mRNA levels were low at birth and increased during the 50-day postnatal period, with liver levels increasing by over 100-fold. In contrast, stomach, muscle, and testicular IGF-I mRNA levels were highest at the earliest stages examined (late fetal or early neonatal) and declined thereafter to the levels observed in 50-day-old rats. In brain, IGF-I mRNA levels rose 2-fold during the first week of life and declined over the next 6-7 weeks. Lung IGF-I mRNA levels were highest in 20-day-old fetuses and exhibited some fluctuation during the postnatal period. Alternative splicing in the 5'-untranslated region of the primary rat IGF-I transcript gives rise to three transcripts, classes A, B, and C, which have divergent 5'-untranslated region sequences associated with a common region that encodes the mature IGF-I peptide. These sequences contain upstream in-frame translation initiation codons and may, therefore, encode alternate IGF-I prepropeptides. The class C variant was the predominant mRNA species at all stages of development studied and was the only IGF-I transcript in brain, heart, and muscle. In tissues where multiple 5'-untranslated region splicing variants occurred, therefore, changes in total IGF-I mRNA primarily reflected changes in this splicing variant. However, the class C and class A (as well as class B in liver) transcripts exhibited temporally divergent changes over some developmental intervals. Class A transcripts in the liver, stomach, testes, and lung as well as class B transcripts in liver, exhibited sustained increases from 15 or 22 postnatal days to maximal levels at 50 postnatal days. In kidney, class A transcripts also increased steadily, but beginning at an earlier stage, i.e. at 8-15 days of postnatal life. These results demonstrate that the temporal expression of total IGF-I mRNA in the developing rat occurs in a tissue-specific manner, and additionally, that IGF-I mRNA variants are differentially expressed during development.\r"

  ".W": "Androgens play a major role in the development, growth, and function of accessory sexual organs, especially the prostate. However, the testis is not the sole source of circulating androgens in man, since the adrenal gland secretes dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate, and androstenedione (delta 4-dione) in large quantities. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of plasma concentrations of DHEA and delta 4-dione similar to those found in adult man on sensitive and specific markers of androgen action in the rat ventral prostate. In addition to ventral prostate weight, we have measured the steady state levels of the mRNAs encoding the C1 component of rat prostatic binding protein (PBP-C1) and spermine-binding protein (SBP) using 35S-labeled cDNA probes for in situ hybridization. One week after castration, ventral prostate weight fell 84%, while prostatic 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and androgen-dependent mRNAs were undetectable. When administered via Silastic implants to castrated adult rats for 1 week, plasma concentrations of 1.37 +/- 0.06 ng/ml DHEA or 0.43 +/- 0.08 ng/ml delta 4-dione independently caused increases in ventral prostate weight to 33% and 65% of normal values, respectively. The same plasma levels of DHEA and delta 4-dione resulted in high intraprostatic levels of DHT to 1.19 +/- 0.34 and 3.66 +/- 0.89 ng/g tissue, respectively. Furthermore, DHEA caused an increase in the steady state levels of PBP-C1 and SBP mRNAs to 50% and 57% of the normal state, respectively, while delta 4-dione caused increases corresponding to 80% and 119% of control values, respectively. Castrated adult rats receiving testosterone at a concentration of 1.66 +/- 0.37 ng/ml plasma maintained normal ventral prostate weight and gene expression levels. The present results demonstrate that circulating levels of the adrenal steroids DHEA and delta 4-dione comparable to those found in man cause an important stimulation of androgen-dependent gene expression in the rat, probably after their conversion to DHT in the prostatic tissue itself.\r"

  ".W": "Affinity-purified human testosterone-binding globulin (hTeBG) is composed of two subunits [mol wt (Mr), 52,200 and 48,600], as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), electrophoretic transfer, and immunochemical localization with a monoclonal antibody raised against rat androgen-binding protein. Fluorography of SDS-PAGE gels on which photoaffinity-labeled hTeBG was analyzed yielded essentially identical results. Enzymatic deglycosylation of hTeBG with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid led to the production of two subunits of 50,800 and 47,300 Mr when assessed by SDS-PAGE. Treatment of hTeBG with an optimal concentration of N-glycanase to remove Asn-linked oligosaccharides produced a single subunit of 44,100 Mr. When hTeBG was treated with neuraminidase and O-glycanase to remove O-linked oligosaccharides, three subunits were seen, two of which had Mr not clearly different from those obtained with neuraminidase treatment alone plus a subunit of 40,900 Mr. Treatment of hTeBG with a combination of all three enzymes produced a single subunit of 42,900 Mr. Chemical deglycosylation with trifluoromethane-sulfonic acid produced a single subunit with a Mr identical to that produced by treatment with all three enzymes. We concluded that this is the Mr of completely deglycosylated hTeBG. Based on this Mr, carbohydrates contribute 18% and 12% to the apparent Mr of the heavy and light subunits of hTeBG, respectively. Two-dimensional PAGE analysis of hTeBG with its oligosaccharides intact indicated that the heavy subunit was composed of seven isoelectric variants with pI values of 5.87-6.55, while the light subunit was composed of four charge variants with pI values of 6.14-6.55. Treatment of hTeBG with the enzymes resulted in a shift in the pH values to a more basic pH range, indicating that carbohydrate removal also removed charged species from the protein. The greatest cathodal shift occurred when hTeBG was treated with a combination of the three enzymes (pI 7.33-7.77) or when it was chemically deglycosylated (pI 6.37-7.02). Despite the apparent removal of all carbohydrates, the single subunit was still composed of multiple isoforms. This finding suggests that other charged species remain on the hTeBG molecule.\r"

Competitive analysis showed that mammary 5'-MA is not inhibited by high (10 microM) concentrations of T4 or T3, but is highly sensitive to prophythiouracil (5 mM). Kinetic parameters demonstrate an acompetitive bisubstrate enzymatic mechanism known as the ping-pong type. The Km and maximum velocity for rT3 were 0.40 microM and 1.42 nmol/mg.min, respectively. These results provide the first evidence that 5'-MA is present in the lactating mammary gland and suggest that this enzymatic activity corresponds to type I enzyme.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of a number of different sulfhydryl agents on cholecystokinin (CCK)-binding sites in isolated fundic gastric glands and gastric mucosal membranes from guinea pigs were evaluated. [125I]CCK octapeptide binding was significantly reduced when gastric glands were pretreated with iodoacetamide (IA; 10 mM), p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB; 0.1 mM), or N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; 0.1 mM) at 24 C, but not by dithiothreitol (DTT; 1.0 mM) or dinitrothiobenzoic acid (DTNB; 10 mM). In contrast, inclusion of DTT or IA during binding led to significant increases in the amount of radioligand bound, while in the presence of DTNB binding was significantly reduced. Glycine-HCl wash of gastric glands pretreated with these agents indicated that NEM and IA reduced radioligand internalization by about 80% (P less than 0.001) and increased surface binding by 20% (P less than 0.01) and 76% (P less than 0.001), respectively. PCMB inhibited radioligand binding to surface sites by more than 90% and completely inhibited radioligand internalization. Gastric mucosal membranes bound significantly less radioligand after PCMB (80%) and NEM (26%) treatment compared to controls, and significantly more after IA treatment (162%). Scatchard analysis of the CCK-receptor interaction indicated two binding sites with dissociation constants of 0.71 and 11.7 nM, and binding capacities of 3.6 and 15.8 nmol/mg DNA, respectively. NEM and IA significantly increased the Kd of the high affinity site without affecting the binding parameters of the low affinity site; the low affinity site was eliminated by PCMB treatment, and the affinity and capacity of the high affinity site were significantly reduced. In the presence of DTT, [125I]CCK octapeptide binding to gastric glands was enhanced with a significant increase in the amount of radioligand in the internalized pool (39%; P less than 0.001) and no increase in binding to gastric mucosal membranes. These results suggest that sulfhydryl groups play an important role in CCK-receptor interactions.\r"

  ".U": "89251451\r", 
  ".W": "Uptake of Ca2+ in cells isolated from rat duodenum declined in the senescent rats. This age-related change was not due to an alteration in the rate of Ca2+ efflux or in the size of the cell. The decrease appeared specific, as alpha-methyl glucoside uptake was not altered. Cell population, as monitored by sucrase activity for villus cells, was not different between duodenal cells isolated from 6- and 24-month-old rats. Kinetic analysis shows the Vmax, the apparent maximum uptake capacity, decreased in the cells from senescent rats whereas the Km, the apparent affinity to Ca2+, was unchanged. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] were determined as a function of age; the levels of 25OHD were not significantly different in 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month-old rats. On the other hand, serum 1,25-(OH)2D decreased throughout the age range studied. Since duodenal Ca2+ uptake is closely regulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3, we tested the hypothesis that low serum 1,25-(OH)2D in the senescent rats may have contributed to the decline in duodenal Ca2+ uptake. In vivo administration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to senescent rats significantly enhanced Ca2+ uptake activity in the isolated duodenal cells. After 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment, Ca2+ uptake activity in cells isolated from senescent rats was only slightly less than that in cells from adult rats. We conclude that duodenal Ca2+ uptake declined in the senescent rats, and this age-related change was most likely due to the low serum level of 1,25-(OH)2D and not the result of a decrease in any duodenal response to 1,25-(OH)2D3.\r"

Cells were grown to a confluent monolayer and had a fibroblastic appearance, similar to cells cultured in the presence of 10% serum [horse-fetal calf (6:1), stripped three times with dextran-coated charcoal]. However, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (PgR) concentrations were higher in cells grown in serum-free medium than in cells grown in serum. Uterine cells grown in ITS contain PgR levels that are near maximum (927 +/- 168 fmol/mg protein), and estradiol (0.1 nM; 24 h) causes a 10-50% increase in PgR. Addition of serum or monohydroxytamoxifen for 24 h decreases PgR levels by about 50%, and estrogen can completely overcome the inhibition caused by either serum or monohydroxytamoxifen. Our data suggest that PgR levels may be down-regulated by a component of serum.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were performed to determine pharmacologically the corticosteroid receptor type that mediates the effects of corticosterone (B) on ACTH secretion in adrenalectomized rats. We have compared the effects of treating young male rats at the time of adrenalectomy and throughout the next 5 days with B, dexamethasone (DEX), or aldosterone (ALDO) in doses that elevated plasma levels to concentrations in the range between 0.2-30 nM. Plasma ACTH, corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), and thymus weight were measured in the morning or evening, and these steroid-sensitive end points were related to the circulating concentrations of B (total B - CBG-bound B), total DEX, and total ALDO. For the inhibition of ACTH the rank order of potency of the three steroids was B greater than DEX greater than or equal to ALDO in the morning (estimated IC50, 0.7 +/- 0.1, 2.3 +/- 0.5, and 4.9 +/- 1.6 nM for B, DEX, and ALDO, respectively). There was a significant shift to the right in steroid efficacy between morning and evening (estimated IC50 in the evening, 3.9 +/- 0.2 and 9.3 +/- 0.8 nM for B and DEX; ALDO at the concentrations achieved was ineffective). The rightward shift in efficacy may result from the circadian increase in drive to ACTH secretion. The rank order of potency for B and DEX on ACTH and the agreement between the steady state IC50 values achieved for these steroids and the Kd values determined for B and DEX with type I receptors in vitro strongly suggest that feedback control of basal diurnal ACTH by corticosteroids is mediated by association with type I, B-preferring receptors. By contrast, DEX was 3 times more potent than B on CBG (estimated IC50, 1.5 and 4.5 nM, respectively) and tended to be more effective on thymus weight, suggesting that the effects of corticosteroids on these peripheral targets are mediated by association of the steroids with type II glucocorticoid receptors. ALDO coinfused with DEX or B did not alter the inhibitory effects of these on ACTH, suggesting that ALDO does not interfere with these type I, B-preferring receptors in vivo. Because there is little if any evidence for type I corticosteroid receptors in the hypothalamus, these results strongly suggest that the majority of corticosteroid feedback inhibition of basal morning and evening ACTH secretion is mediated transynaptically by the activity of extra-hypothalamic neurons.\r"

  ".W": "Effect of cytosolic 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3)-binding protein (CTBP) on [125I]T3 binding to nuclei was investigated in vitro. CTBP and nuclei were prepared from rat kidney. CTBP was inactivated by incubating with charcoal and activated by incubating with NADPH or with NADP and dithiothreitol. Two complexes of CTBP and T3 [CTBP-T3(NADPH) and CTBP-T3(NADP)] were separately prepared, and the functions of these complexes were estimated. [125I]T3 binding to nuclei was not influenced by the inactive form of CTBP. NADP or NADPH alone did not modify [125I]T3 binding to the nuclei. However, the binding was markedly inhibited by NADPH in the presence of the inactive form of CTBP, but it was not inhibited by NADP in the presence of the inactive form of CTBP. The ability of nuclei to bind [125I]T3 was markedly diminished by pretreatment of the nuclei with 10(-8) M unlabeled T3. The diminished activity was not modified by adding NADPH or NADP. However, [125I]T3 bound to these nuclei in the presence of NADP and the inactive form of CTBP. Binding of [125I]T3 to these nuclei was not observed in the presence of NADPH and the inactive form of CTBP. When the nuclei that had previously been saturated with 10(-6) M unlabeled T3 were incubated with [125I]T3-CTBP(NADP) complex, radioactivity bound to the nuclei. The binding of radioactivity, however, was not observed when these nuclei were incubated with [125I]T3. The [125I]T3-CTBP(NADPH) complex did not bind to these nuclei. When the nuclei that had previously been treated with T3-CTBP(NADP) complex were incubated with [125I]T3, radioactivity bound to the nuclei. The binding of radioactivity, however, was not observed when these nuclei were incubated with [125I] T3-CTBP(NADP) complex. The [125I]T3-CTBP(NADPH) complex did not bind to these nuclei. These results suggested that 1) CTBP activated by NADP plays a role as a carrier protein for T3 from cytoplasm to nucleus; 2) there are binding sites for T3-CTBP(NADP) complex in rat kidney nuclei; and 3) these binding sites are different from nuclear T3 receptors.\r"

Conditioned medium from AP cultures contained specific high affinity IGF BPs with apparent mol wt of 35K, 27K, and 24K, while the 27K BP predominated in NI conditioned medium. Treatment of AP and NI conditioned media with endoglycosidase-F did not alter the 27K BP, but significantly reduced the apparent mol wt of the 35K BP into the 27-29K range, suggesting that the 35K BP may be a glycosylated form of the 27K BP. This 27K pituitary BP appeared similar to the BP produced by BRL-3A cells in both size and apparent lack of glycosylation. Although type 2 IGF receptors could be identified in conditioned medium from NI and GH3 pituitary cells, binding of [125I]IGF to pituitary BPs could not be inhibited, nor could the cross-linked BPs be immunoprecipitated, by antibody against the type 2 receptor. We conclude that cultured AP and NI cells produce a variety of related IGF BPs that are structurally distinct from the type 2 IGF receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Endogenous opioid peptides have been implicated as mediators in the negative feedback action of gonadal steroids on GnRH secretion. We have previously demonstrated that testosterone stimulates POMC gene expression in neurons of the arcuate nucleus. However, the wide distribution and variety of actions attributed to the numerous arcuate POMC neurons suggest that these cells may be heterogeneous in their responsiveness to steroid hormones. We tested the hypothesis that testosterone modulates a select population of POMC neurons within the arcuate nucleus of the adult male rat by comparing POMC mRNA signal levels throughout the arcuate nucleus of intact, castrated, and castrated testosterone-replaced adult males. Adult male rats were castrated and implanted (sc) with a Silastic capsule (30 mm) that was either empty (n = 6) or filled with crystalline testosterone (n = 5). Control sham-operated animals (n = 6) were left intact. In each animal the arcuate nucleus was divided into four equal rostral-caudal areas within which we measured POMC mRNA content in individual cells. We report that the effects of castration and testosterone replacement are observed in POMC neurons located in the most rostral region of the arcuate nucleus. After castration, POMC mRNA content was reduced in cells of the most rostral arcuate area (intact, 152 +/- 5 grains/cell; castrate, 119 +/- 2 grains/cell; P less than 0.0005), and replacement with physiological levels of testosterone prevented the decline in POMC mRNA levels so that they remained equivalent to that of the intact animal (castrated testosterone-replaced, 153 +/- 6 grains/cell). There was no significant difference in POMC mRNA signal between intact and castrated testosterone-replaced animals in the most rostral area. POMC neurons in the more caudal aspect of the arcuate (75% of the nucleus) were unaffected by the treatments; alternatively, it is possible that a real change in POMC message content in a subpopulation of cells was obscured by larger numbers of nonresponding cells within the same tissue sections. Based on these observations we conclude that there is a heterogeneous population of POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus and that testosterone regulates POMC gene expression in a select group of these cells located in the rostral portion of the arcuate nucleus.\r"

Cultured in the presence of TSH, these cells express a TPO mRNA species of 3.1 kilobases. TSH withdrawal from the culture medium led to a decline in TPO mRNA levels over 24 h. In contrast, no decline in beta-actin mRNA levels occurred after 24 h of incubation in TSH-free medium. TSH (1 mU/ml) added to FRTL5 cells cultured in the absence of TSH increased TPO mRNA levels 7- to 9-fold compared to levels in control cells. This effect of TSH on TPO mRNA accumulation in FRTL5 cells was time related (it was already present after 4 h and was maximal after 24 h of cell exposure to TSH), dose related (0.01 and 1 mU/ml were, respectively, the lowest and the maximally effective doses), and independent of new protein synthesis, in that it was not prevented by cycloheximide (100 microM). cAMP analogues [8-bromo-cAMP and (Bu)2cAMP] also increased TPO mRNA levels, although to a lesser degree than TSH. Run-on transcription analysis in nuclei prepared from FRTL5 cells previously cultured in the presence or absence of TSH did not reveal any difference in TPO mRNA transcripts. These results suggest that TSH regulates the level of TPO mRNA in FRTL5 cells, in part via the second messenger cAMP and by a nontranscriptional mechanism. This TSH effect may represent a primary site of TSH action in regulating TPO bioactivity.\r"

This depletion of ATP by H2O2 was prevented by nicotinamide or 3-aminobenzamide, inhibitors of DNA repair, but these inhibitors did not prevent the antigonadotropic action of H2O2. cAMP accumulation in response to forskolin was not inhibited by H2O2 when ATP depletion was blocked with 3-aminobenzamide. The specific binding of radiolabeled hCG to isolated cells or the biological activity of LH was not affected by H2O2 pretreatment of the cells. Isobutylmethylxanthine had no effect on abrogation of LH-sensitive cAMP accumulation by H2O2. The actions of H2O2 were not mediated by prostaglandin, since indomethacin was without effect and an increase in prostaglandin F2 alpha production was not seen with H2O2 treatment. The acute luteolytic actions of H2O2 thus appear to be due to a very rapid desensitization of the LH-receptor complex, followed by depletion of ATP. The abrogation of luteotropic support and the injurious consequences of ATP depletion raise the possibility that H2O2 may be a physiological mediator of luteolysis.\r"

  ".W": "Relaxin is structurally related to insulin, and it induces pregnancy-related changes in the reproductive tract of several mammalian species. Relaxin isolated from the ovaries of pregnant sows has been used for primary structure determination, for much of the biological characterization of the hormone, and for the development of RIAs. Immunoreactive (IR) relaxin is found in peripheral blood during pregnancy in pigs and other species, but it has not been established that the substance identified by RIA is structurally or biologically equivalent to the native ovarian hormone. IR relaxin was, therefore, isolated from peripheral plasma of late pregnant gilts (days 112-114) for bioassay and determination of terminal amino acid residues. IR relaxin was monitored by a specific homologous RIA during fractionation of plasma by gel filtration, cation exchange, and hydrophobic binding to octadecysilica. IR relaxin circulates unbound and is equipotent with ovarian relaxin in the mouse pubic ligament bioassay. Amino acids released from IR relaxin by pyroglutamic aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase-Y were converted to their 4-dimethylamino-azo-4'-sulfonyl derivatives for identification by HPLC. The B-chain of IR relaxin had an amino-terminal pyroglutamic acid. Amino acids sequentially released from the carboxy-terminal indicated a chain length of 28-30 amino acids, suggesting a heterogeneity reminiscent of that of ovarian relaxin isolated by other methods. Arginine was released from the free amino-terminal by dimethylaminozaobenzene-isothiocyanate degradation, indicating an intact A-chain of 22 amino acids. Blood immunoreactive relaxin in pigs is, therefore, a secreted biologically active form of relaxin with an amino acid composition similar to that of the form stored in the corpus luteum.\r"

  ".W": "A large mol wt binding protein for insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) has been described in fetal sheep serum. We now provide evidence to demonstrate that this binding protein is the IGF-II/mannose-6-phosphate (Man-6-P) receptor. Serum and plasma were gel filtered on Sephadex G-200, and the column fractions were assayed for binding of radiolabeled IGF-II. There was significant binding of [125I]IGF-II to the void volume fractions in addition to binding to the 150K and 40K carrier proteins. Binding to the void volume fractions was increased in fetal serum as well as maternal serum and dramatically decreased in the nonpregnant adult. Competitive binding studies with [125I]IGF-II and the void volume pools from fetal and maternal sheep serum demonstrated that IGF-I competed less potently than IGF-II, and insulin did not compete. There was no specific binding of [125I]IGF-I to the void volume pools of either fetal or maternal samples. Chemical cross-linking of [125I]IGF-II to aliquots of the void volume pools from fetal and maternal sheep serum samples and analysis with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dithiothreitol demonstrated a specific band at about 240K. Western blotting using a specific antiserum (no. 3637) against rat IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor was performed on aliquots of the Sephadex G-200 void volume pools of fetal, maternal, uterine vein, and adult sheep serum; a band of approximately 210K (without dithiothreitol) was seen. The IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor band was more intense in fetal serum than in either maternal or adult nonpregnant sheep serum. There was also increased binding of [125I]IGF-II in the 40K region of the Sephadex G-200 column fractions in the maternal serum compared to that in serum from nonpregnant adult ewes. When fetal, maternal, and adult nonpregnant sheep serum Sephadex G-200 pools were gel filtered on Sephadex G-50 in 1 mol/liter acetic acid to separate bound from free IGF, and IGF-II was measured by RRA, approximately 50% of the circulating IGF-II was associated with this IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor in fetal serum compared to 7% in maternal serum and 3% in adult nonpregnant serum. These data demonstrate that the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor circulates in fetal sheep serum as well as maternal serum and appears to be a significant carrier for IGF-II in fetal sheep.\r"

By dual metabolic labeling with [35S]sulfate and [3H]mannose, we have characterized oligosaccharides from secreted TSH alpha, TSH beta, and free alpha-subunits released from the apoprotein by enzymatic deglycosylation. Oligosaccharides from each subunit displayed a distinct anion exchange HPLC profile due to a specific pattern of sialylation and sulfation. Six species were obtained from TSH alpha (with two glycosylation sites), including neutral oligosaccharides as well as those with one or two negative charges. For TSH beta (with one glycosylation site) at least eight oligosaccharide species were noted, representing nearly every permutation of sialylation and sulfation; approximately 30% contained three or more negative charges. Analysis of [3H]mannose-labeled oligosaccharides on Concanavalin-A-agarose showed 85% binding for those from TSH alpha, 70% for free alpha, and 50% for those from TSH beta. These data demonstrate that oligosaccharides from secreted TSH beta were more sialylated and sulfated, consistent with a more complex branching pattern, than those from TSH alpha. Oligosaccharides from free alpha-subunit were more sialylated than those from TSH alpha, and the net negative charge was intermediate between those of TSH alpha and TSH beta. Although great microheterogeneity is present even at the single glycosylation site on the beta-subunit of secreted TSH, a pattern of sialylation and sulfation could be discerned. If one assigns probabilities of sialylation [p(N)] and sulfation [p(S)] based on the observed distribution within monoacidic (charge -1) species, the proportion of diacidic (charge -2) oligosaccharides could be predicted for each subunit by [p(N)]2, 2[p(N)] [p(S)], [p(S)]2, corresponding to species containing two sialic acid, one sialic acid and one sulfate, and two sulfate residues, respectively. This suggests that the probability of sialylation or sulfation at a second site on these oligosaccharides is similar to that at the first and that anionic oligosaccharides in secreted TSH and free alpha are distributed binomially with regard to sialic acid and sulfate residues.\r"

To determined if IR-ACTH reflects bioactive (B) ACTH after hemorrhage, changes in B-ACTH and IR-ACTH were determined in awake dogs. Trained dogs were prepared with adrenal venous and femoral arterial and venous cannula. Experiments performed 48-96 h after surgery consisted of blood sampling from the adrenal vein and femoral artery before and after a 7.5-10 ml/kg hemorrhage done over 3 min. Cortisol was assayed by HPLC with UV detection, and adrenal secretory rates were calculated using adrenal blood flow. Arterial B-ACTH was assayed after extraction using rat adrenal cells dispersed with collagenase; corticosterone produced was assayed by HPLC-UV. Arterial IR-ACTH was assayed by RIA using antisera directed against ACTH-(1-24). Dogs in which hypotension occurred (change in mean arterial pressure, -31 +/- 3; n = 6) were compared to dogs in which mean arterial pressure did not change (change in mean arterial pressure, -6 +/- 2; n = 5). In the absence of hypotension, B-ACTH increased by 10 min after the onset of hemorrhage coincident with increased cortisol secretion, whereas IR-ACTH did not increase until 20 min. Resting IR-ACTH was greater than B-ACTH (11 +/- 1 vs. 2 +/- 1 pg/ml), but the peak response of B-ACTH was greater than that of IR-ACTH (13 +/- 4 vs. 8 +/- 3 pg/ml). In the presence of hypotension, B-ACTH increased by 4 min, and IR-ACTH and cortisol secretion increased by 8 min after the onset of hemorrhage. Resting IR-ACTH was greater than B-ACTH (27 +/- 5 vs. 6 +/- 1 pg/ml), and the peak response of B-ACTH was less than that of IR-ACTH (64 +/- 26 vs. 112 +/- 33 pg/ml). In dogs subjected to blood sampling without hemorrhage (n = 4), resting IR-ACTH was greater than B-ACTH (34 +/- 5 vs. 5 +/- 1 pg/ml), but there was no change in B-ACTH, IR-ACTH, or cortisol secretion. The results show that small hemorrhage elicits changes in B-ACTH that are dissociated in time and magnitude from changes in IR-ACTH, are coincident with changes in cortisol secretion, and are greater in dogs that fail to maintain arterial pressure. These data indicate that B-ACTH predicts more accurately the change in cortisol secretion than does IR-ACTH after small hemorrhage.\r"

This TGF beta effect was localized at the sites of injection, and no change was observed in contralateral parietal bones and tibiae. The body weight in these growing rats was not affected by TGF beta 1. TGF beta 2 had effects similar to those of TGF beta 1 on the parietal bones in vivo. These results reveal for the first time that TGF beta stimulates bone formation in vivo and indicate its anabolic role in local bone metabolism.\r"

Preincubation of fura-2-loaded myometrial cell suspensions with relaxin and isoproterenol inhibited the oxytocin-induced stimulation of intracellular free calcium, with EC50 values of 0.02 and 1.0 microM, respectively. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin or replacement of extracellular calcium with 2 mM EGTA inhibited the oxytocin-induced increase in intracellular calcium by 47% and 50%, respectively, but did not inhibit the action of relaxin. (Bu)2cAMP and forskolin also inhibited the effect of oxytocin on intracellular calcium. In uterine strips prelabeled with [3H]inositol, oxytocin stimulated a dose-dependent accumulation of inositol monophosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol trisphosphate, with and EC50 of 0.38 microM, and pertussis toxin inhibited this effect. Relaxin, isoproterenol, chlorophenylthio-cAMP, and forskolin inhibited the oxytocin-stimulated formation of inositol monophosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol trisphosphate. The effect of relaxin on inositol trisphosphate formation was dose dependent, with an EC50 of 0.1 microM. Relaxin and isoproterenol also inhibited inositol phosphate formation in myometrial cells. These data demonstrate the attenuation of contractant-induced elevation in myometrial intracellular calcium and phosphoinositide turnover by uterine relaxants and suggest that these actions may be related. In addition, they provide additional evidence that cAMP-mediated mechanisms may be involved in mediating uterine relaxation.\r"

We have examined the plasma and tissue levels of these peptides during the first 3 weeks of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in the rat. Plasma glucose levels were markedly elevated (P less than 0.0001) within 24 h of STZ administration. The plasma levels of glucagon-like immunoreactive (GLI) peptides were significantly elevated on days 8-22 of diabetes (P less than 0.05-0.001). Ileal GLI peptide concentrations rose in parallel with the plasma levels (r = 0.39; P less than 0.006) to 250% of control levels (P less than 0.001); however, pancreatic GLI peptide content increased only transiently on day 1 (P less than 0.05). No significant differences in the posttranslational processing of proglucagon in normal or diabetic rats could be detected. The increment in ileal GLI peptide content was not associated with increases in intestinal proglucagon mRNA transcripts. In contrast, pancreatic, but not intestinal, somatostatin mRNA levels were increased on day 22 of diabetes. Diabetic rats were found to have small but significant changes in GLI and immunoreactive glucagon peptide content of the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata (P less than 0.05). These observations suggest that STZ-induced diabetes may produce tissue-specific perturbations in the biosynthesis and secretion of the proglucagon-derived peptides.\r"

The present studies were performed to determine if gender influenced the serum TSH changes associated with fasting. In 8 of 10 experiments in male rats, serum TSH concentrations were significantly reduced in fasted compared to fed groups. In contrast, in none of the 9 experiments in female rats were serum TSH concentrations significantly reduced in the fasted groups. When all experiments were pooled, the decrease in the serum TSH concentration in the fasted rats compared to that in the fed rats was 55 +/- 4% (mean +/- SE) in males and 10 +/- 7% in females (P less than 0.001). In female rats ovariectomy did not result in a pattern in which fasting was associated with a decrease in serum TSH concentrations. Testosterone (T) was administered to male rats during fasting, but this treatment did not prevent the fasting-induced decrease in serum TSH concentrations. In gonadectomized male rats serum TSH concentrations were unchanged by fasting. However, if T was administered to gonadectomized male rats before and during fasting, serum TSH concentrations were significantly decreased in the fasted compared to the fed rats. These studies indicate that there is a sex difference in the serum TSH response to fasting in rats. The decline in serum TSH with fasting in the male rat is not mediated by a decline in serum T concentrations. Rather, T appears to maintain a process which increases the serum TSH concentration, and it is this process that is susceptible to inhibition by fasting.\r"

One cell line, RCT-1, isolated from early digest cells, a population which typically does not express osteoblastic features, displayed osteoblastic characteristics only after 3 days of treatment with 1 microM retinoic acid: alkaline phosphatase activity increased from 0.003 to 0.25 mumol/min.mg protein, the steady state level of type I procollagen mRNA increased 4-fold, and the cells acquired a PTH-stimulatable adenylate cyclase (EC50, 10 nM). mRNA for osteopontin, an abundant bone matrix protein, was induced in RCT-1 cells by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (10 nM). The second cell line, RCT-3, isolated from late digest cells, a population previously shown to be enriched with differentiated osteoblasts, expressed constitutively the properties described above. In addition, RCT-3 cells responded to interleukin-1 by increased prostaglandin production (EC50, 20 pM) and to prostaglandin E2 by enhanced cAMP accumulation, features exhibited by calvarial cells in organ culture. Thus, the SV-40 immortalized cell lines we describe retained many of the characteristics of osteoblasts in primary culture, including hormonal regulation of phenotype-related genes. In RCT-1 cells the coordinate induction of several properties by retinoic acid offers a new model for the study of differentiation-related gene expression in bone cells.\r"

In the presence of pure human IGF-I (50 ng/ml), the half-maximally effective concentration of swine HDL was 16 micrograms/ml (67% confidence limits; 15-17 micrograms/ml) after 2 days of exposure to this growth factor, 5.4 (2.6-9.8) micrograms/ml after 4 days, and 3.8 (1.2-4.8) micrograms/ml after 6 days. Maximal progesterone production increased approximately 10-fold in the presence of IGF-I and HDL on day 2, 125-fold on day 4, and 330-fold on day 6. The facilitative action of IGF-I on HDL-supported progesterone biosynthesis was accompanied by time-dependent stimulatory effects of IGF-I on trypsin-releasable HDL, trypsin-resistant cell-associated HDL, and degraded HDL (P less than 0.01). Moreover, incubation of swine granulosa cells with [3H]cholesteryl oleate-labeled HDL demonstrated that IGF-I exerted a time-dependent stimulatory effect on [3H]free cholesterol and [3H]cholesteryl ester accumulation in granulosa cells, and significantly augmented the secretion of [3H]progesterone (separated by two-dimensional TLC). In addition to the ability of IGF-I to amplify the cellular acquisition of radiolabeled sterol, this growth factor also increased the total mass of cellular cholesteryl ester and total cellular cholesterol as measured by microfluorometric assay (P less than 0.01). We conclude that IGF-I facilitates the effective delivery of HDL-derived sterol substrate into the steroidogenic pool of ovarian cells. Such observations offer an additional role for the differentiative actions of this somatomedin in the expression of full steroidogenic potential by granulosa-luteal cells.\r"

Ten-day-old rat embryos or 16-day-old fetal rat paws were transplanted under the capsule of both kidneys of syngeneic hosts, where they grew rapidly, and tissue differentiation occurred in an essentially normal manner. Infusion of a rabbit antiserum to human (h) IGF-I for 6 days into the renal artery of one kidney caused only a slight inhibition (approximately 20%) of growth of transplanted embryos on that kidney. However, 9 days of treatment with the antiserum caused highly significant growth retardation of transplanted embryos by 40-45%. Exposure of fetal paws to the same antiserum for 9 days inhibited their growth by 27%. Infusion of synthetic hIGF-II or partially purified rat IGF-II [(MSA)multiplication-stimulating activity], for 6 days stimulated the growth of embryo transplants directly, and MSA was more effective than hIGF-II. By contrast, infusion of purified natural hIGF-I did not promote their growth. Growth of fetal paw transplants in hypophysectomized (HX) hosts was reduced by 70% compared to that in intact hosts. In the HX hosts infusion of the MSA was more effective than the hIGF-I at promoting the growth of paw transplants. Both MSA and IGF-I promoted ossification in the fetal paws in the HX hosts. These results suggest that both IGFs could be involved in regulating the growth and differentiation in prenatal rats, and IGF-II may be the more effective of the two factors as a growth-promoting agent in utero.\r"

Excessive chronic exposure to GCs accelerates senescent hippocampal neuron loss, while the presence of GCs at the time of neurological insults, such as seizure or hypoxia-ischemia, exacerbates hippocampal damage. The present study determines whether GCs endanger hippocampal neurons through the same mechanism by which they damage lymphocytes. GC-induced lymphocytolysis involves cleavage of chromosomal DNA, most likely through steroid induction of a nuclease that produces a characteristic ladder of fragmented DNA. Moreover, inhibition of DNA repair using the poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase inhibitor benzamide exacerbates GC-induced lymphocytolysis. We replicated this GC-induced fragmentation of DNA in thymocytes, but observed the absence of a similar fragmentation in DNA from primary hippocampal cultures under conditions in which GCs exacerbate the toxic effects of the excitotoxin kainic acid. Furthermore, under such conditions benzamide did not worsen the GC/kainic acid toxicity. These observations suggest that GCs endanger hippocampal neurons through a different mechanism, one that seems likely to be less sterotyped and simple than this cascade of apoptosis in lymphocytes.\r"

There was a clear and significant (F = 4.46; P less than 0.005) rhythm in vasopressin concentrations in the CSF of nine fetuses, characterized by a mean trough value of 19.4 +/- 6.4 pg/ml (mean +/- SD) at 0200 h and a peak value of 41.1 +/- 28.0 pg/ml at 1400 h. The mean cycle length was 23.2 +/- 1.7 h, with the majority (greater than 80%) of peak concentrations found during daylight hours. There were no concurrent fluctuations in concentrations of vasopressin in plasma or Na, K, Cl, or osmolality in CSF. To examine the relationship between environmental cycles of light and darkness and rhythm of vasopressin concentrations in CSF, pregnant animals were maintained in a constant light environment. In the five fetuses of ewes maintained under these conditions, the rhythm of vasopressin in CSF was markedly damped or not apparent (F = 1.50; P greater than 0.15). These results demonstrate that prominent circadian rhythm of vasopressin in the CSF of the fetus in utero. Despite the fact that the fetus is sequestered from direct influences of the environment, exposure of the pregnant ewe to constant light disrupts the fetal pacemaker that generates the circadian rhythm of vasopressin in CSF. Studies of this rhythm in the fetal lamb, therefore, provide a means to examine the mechanisms of entrainment and assess prenatal influences on circadian organization of the fetus.\r"

  ".W": "Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is released in response to changes in blood osmolality and is also a putative secretagogue for ACTH. However, it is unclear whether osmotically generated increases in AVP in the physiological range influence ACTH secretion. We have studied this question using our unique noninvasive technique for collecting pituitary venous blood in six normal conscious horses that received an iv infusion of hypertonic saline (HS; 5%, 0.07 ml/kg.min) for 45-60 min. Pituitary and jugular venous samples were collected every 5 min for 40 min before, during, and for 20 min after HS. During HS, mean blood osmolality rose (P less than 0.01), with a mean peak increase of 14.8 mosmol/kg (range, +6-+37 mosmol/kg). Jugular AVP rose (P less than 0.01) from 0.56 +/- 0.18 pmol/liter (mean +/- SEM) before HS to 2.16 +/- 0.86 pmol/liter during HS. Mean jugular AVP and osmolality were correlated (r = 0.82; P less than 0.05) during HS. Mean jugular ACTH concentrations increased (P less than 0.01) from 49 +/- 9 ng/liter before HS to 148 +/- 54 ng/liter during HS, while mean cortisol levels during and after HS exceeded basal levels (P less than 0.05). Pituitary AVP and ACTH concentrations exceeded jugular concentrations by up to 100-fold, and mean (P less than 0.01 for both) and peak (P less than 0.001 for both) levels increased during HS. AVP and ACTH secretion during HS were pulsatile. The mean and peak changes in pituitary AVP were significantly correlated with those in ACTH. For the six horses together, pituitary ACTH and AVP concentration changes occurred synchronously during the experiment (P less than 0.001), and the paired AVP and ACTH concentrations were highly correlated (r = 0.73; n = 129 pairs; P less than 0.001). We conclude that 1) physiological changes in AVP secretion are closely associated with comparable changes in ACTH secretion, and 2) osmotic signals that presumably activate the magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei may be physiologically relevant regulators of corticotrope function.\r"

VIP (10(-7) M) produced an acute 40% inhibition of glucose oxidation and a 115% stimulation of palmitate oxidation. Addition of epinephrine (10(-6) M) together with propranolol (10(-6) M) to avoid interference with beta-adrenoreceptors did not affect basal glucose and palmitate oxidation, but suppressed the effects of VIP by more than 90%. The inhibition by VIP of pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetylcoenzyme-A carboxylase, the enzymes considered as the target sites for the neuropeptide, was also abolished by epinephrine. We assumed that epinephrine acted through the stimulation of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, since 1) epinephrine suppressed VIP-induced accumulation of cAMP in the cells; and 2) the alpha 2-agonist clonidine (10(-6) M) reproduced epinephrine effects, whereas they were abolished by the alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine (10(-6) M). These findings strengthen the assumption that VIP controls glucose and fatty acid metabolism by a cAMP-dependent mechanism and demonstrate, for the first time, that the contribution of substrates as energy fuel is under dual neurohormonal regulation by VIP and catecholamines in isolated rat enterocytes.\r"

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that intracellular sex steroid hormone concentrations are normal or at least adequate to maintain normal reproductive function in these rats. To test whether intracellular testosterone concentrations in these rats are maintained by the circulating concentration of free or free-plus-weakly-bound testosterone, we measured the concentrations of total testosterone, free testosterone, and non-sex-hormone-binding-globulin-bound testosterone in sera from five adult male Nagase analbuminemic rats and from five age- and sex-matched controls. We found that the analbuminemic rats had markedly decreased serum concentrations of total and non-sex-hormone-binding-globulin-bound testosterone, but normal serum concentrations of free testosterone. These results suggest that intracellular concentrations of testosterone in biologically relevant organs of the rat are maintained by the concentration of free rather than free-plus-weakly-bound testosterone in plasma, in accord with the free hormone hypothesis.\r"

In contrast to the marked reduction of wet dog shakes (WDS) in adult rats, in suckling rats persistent and prolonged WDS were observed as kindling progressed. The faster development of hippocampal kindling in suckling rats than in adult rats was explained by the different excitability of the stimulated brain site and the different extent of neural connections in many brain structures, which participate in generalization of seizures arising from a stimulated site.\r"

Strong bidirectional transhemispheric transfer between electrical and chemical kindling occurred at the secondary-site AM. In addition, at the primary-site retest, bidirectional posttransfer interference between electrical and chemical kindling was observed.

Tolerance to the actions of three prototype anticonvulsant benzodiazepines (BZDs)--diazepam (DZP), clonazepam (CZP), and clobazam (CLB)--was studied in amygdala-kindled rats. Fully kindled rats were dosed three times daily for 2 or 4 weeks. Amygdala stimulation was given 30 min after drug administration on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 of chronic treatment and then three times weekly. During treatment, tolerance was observed as a loss of drug effect to suppress behavioral and EEG manifestations of seizure activity. Seizure activity remained stable in rats treated with vehicle. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects developed most rapidly during CLB treatment and most slowly during CZP treatment. Tolerance to the motor impairment caused by the drugs developed more rapidly. Assay of the amount of drug in brain extracts, using a BZD receptor assay, showed that tolerance was functional, not metabolic. Doubling the dose did not readily restore full anticonvulsant activity. The response to amygdala stimulation 24 h after treatment was stopped showed no residual BZD effect, but there was a rebound in duration of some seizure measures in rats that had been treated with CLB or DZP. Retesting 48 h after treatment was stopped showed that rats were still tolerant. The amygdala-kindled rat is a reliable and sensitive model for studying long-term actions of anticonvulsant BZDs.\r"

PHT and CBZ are almost selective blockers of Na channels. The main part of this inhibition is a potential-dependent block which can be removed by hyperpolarization. The dose-response curve of PHT was described as a first-order reaction with Kd = 37 microM; 100 microM CBZ was equally as effective 100 microM PHT. Both drugs shift the steady-state Na inactivation curve (h infinity (V] to more negative membrane potentials and decrease its steepness. PHT and CBZ have equimolar effects on the shift and decrease in steepness of h infinity (V). All of the drug-induced effects depend on drug concentration. Both drugs induce a slowing of recovery from Na inactivation. PHT has a stronger slowing effect than CBZ. From this ensues a frequency-dependent block, which is more pronounced in the presence of PHT than of CBZ. The effects of both drugs can be interpreted in the framework of the modulated receptor hypothesis.\r"

Results revealed a significant preoperative relationship between depression and an external locus of control, but this relationship no longer existed postoperatively. Postoperative declines in depression were independent of any alterations in locus of control. Further analyses revealed that depression declined significantly only in patients rendered completely seizure-free by ATL, whereas patients who were significantly improved (greater than or equal to 75% reduction in seizure frequency) but continued to experience some seizure activity showed no changes in self-reported depression.

In contrast, the personality characteristics of psychogenic seizure patients whose attacks had either little affectual display or prominent motor expression could not be distinguished from those of epileptic patients with convulsive generalized seizures. Closely matched groups of patients with solely psychogenic seizures, partial seizures, or generalized seizures did not differ in neuropsychological performance.

Patients with post-swim-up motilities consistently greater than or equal to 70% had a cumulative pregnancy rate (51.2%) significantly greater than patients inconsistent for this parameter (15.6%, P = 0.0116). Consistency of sperm motility is a useful parameter for defining the subpopulation of patients who would benefit from IUI.\r"

In this study, the authors have examined (1) the efficiency of washing procedures to remove contaminating Percoll particles from the separated spermatozoa, and (2) the potential of Percoll particles, which contain silica, to cause an inflammatory response when used for intrauterine insemination, or when introduced into the fallopian tube during gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) procedures, as assessed by an intraperitoneal injection into mice. Although Percoll was phagocytosed at the injection site, and therefore cannot be presumed to be totally inert, no generalized inflammatory response was detected. A double spin and wash technique was found to remove most residual Percoll from the spermatozoa, as assessed by scanning electron microscopy. These results suggest that procedures involving the use of Percoll for the separation of human spermatozoa for in vitro fertilization, GIFT, or intrauterine insemination should include stringent washing protocols that will remove most, if not all, contaminating Percoll from the sample.\r"

Bombesin and GRP share the same carboxyl-terminal heptapeptide sequence that is essential for receptor recognition and biologic activity. Immunohistochemical findings have indicated the presence of a BN-like peptide in the neuroendocrine cells of the human prostate. These findings, together with the high concentrations of different regulatory peptides recently found in seminal plasma, prompted us to characterize a BN-like peptide in human semen by gel-filtration chromatography, reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, and in vitro bioassay. Here we demonstrate that human semen contains high levels (mean +/- standard deviation, 288.9 +/- 114.39 pg/ml) of a substance that closely resembles the 14-27 carboxyl-terminal fragment of GRP (GRP 14-27). The partially purified peptide obtained from this source, examined on an in vitro bioassay that is especially useful for testing BN-like activities, elicits a contractile response of the rat uterus that is indistinguishable from that stimulated by standard BN and GRP 14-27. The GRP 14-27 present in human seminal plasma may be involved in some aspect of the process of fertilization.\r"

All 87 patients were categorized by age, weight, CC dosage, and underlying disease entity. The patients then were evaluated by these categories in relation to the incidence of an OOP biopsy while taking CC. Patients with a diagnosis of hypothalamic amenorrhea were statistically more likely to have an OOP endometrium. No other subgroup showed an increased or decreased incidence of OOP biopsies. Conception and spontaneous abortion rates were similar among patients with in-phase biopsies and those with out-of-phase biopsies, which subsequently were corrected with further medical therapy. An aggressive approach to the diagnosis and treatment of luteal phase insufficiency in patients who receive CC for ovulation induction is recommended.\r"

The 34K IGF-binding protein (34K IGF-BP) has been shown to inhibit the binding of IGF-I to its receptor. The authors evaluated the role of insulin in the regulation of serum levels of 34K IGF-BP in patients with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD). 34K IGF-BP levels during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were measured in 15 PCOD (8 obese and 7 nonobese) patients and in 10 healthy control subjects. The fasting level of 34K IGF-BP was decreased in nonobese PCOD patients (2.4 +/- 0.3 micrograms/l) (mean +/- standard error) (P = 0.02) and obese PCOD patients (0.59 +/- 0.2 micrograms/l) (P less than 0.001) as compared with healthy controls (4.8 +/- 0.9 micrograms/l). Both nonobese PCOD patients and normal controls demonstrated a significant decrease in 34K IGF-BP following OGTT. An insulin-related decrease in 34K IGF-BP may allow an increased pool of IGF-I able to bind to its receptor. This would provide a mechanism for increased ovarian androgen production via IGF-I stimulation of its receptor.\r"

Serum levels of E2, P, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin (PRL) were measured in blood samples collected at the time of biopsy. The E2 (P less than 0.01) and PRL (P less than 0.001) levels were higher in stimulated than in spontaneous cycles. The level of cytoplasmic P receptor was decreased in endometrium in stimulated cycles, but cytoplasmic E2 receptor remained unchanged. These alterations in the luteal phase of cytoplasmic P receptor in the endometrium could be involved in the low rate of success following the IVF program.\r"

Mean duration of marriage at first delivery was 7.4 years, and mean age of the first child was 3.6 years at registration of the data. The incidence of marital break-up in the AID group was 1.8%, as compared with 3.0% to 3.7% in the control group. The difference is not significant (P approximately 0.15). The authors conclude that the separation rate in AID families does not differ significantly from the observed separation rate in a demographically matched population.

This study was designed to evaluate the effects of high carbohydrate (CHO) intake on renal function and structure in this animal model and to determine whether the renal effects are related to the type of CHO ingested. Two groups of 5-wk-old obese male SHR/N-cp rats and lean male littermates were fed diets containing 54% CHO in the form of sucrose or starch. After 12 wk, renal function parameters, including creatinine clearance, urinary glucose excretion, and urinary protein excretion, were measured. Renal morphology was evaluated by semiquantitative light and electron microscopy. On either diet, obese rats had significantly higher urinary glucose and protein excretions than their lean littermates. Mean creatinine clearance (ml/min) in obese rats did not differ significantly from values observed in lean rats. When corrected for body weight, creatinine clearance (ml.min-1.kg-1) tended to be lower in obese than in lean rats, but the difference was significant (P less than .02) only for obese and lean sucrose-fed animals. Obese rats fed sucrose compared with their obese counterparts fed starch had higher body weight (+8%, P less than .05), glucose excretion (+63%, P less than .02), and protein excretion (+242%, P less than .005). In obese rats, protein excretion correlated with glucose excretion (r = .71, P less than .01). Glomerular lesions consisting of mesangial expansion and intercapillary nodules were found in obese but not in lean rats. Moreover, obese rats fed sucrose had a significantly greater number of involved glomeruli than obese rats fed starch.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A restriction-fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) detected with the human insulin-receptor cDNA and the enzyme Sac I has been reported to be associated with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in White and Black populations and segregated with diabetes in two small pedigrees with maturity-onset diabetes of the young. A size difference of approximately 500 base pairs (bp) was demonstrated between the alleles of this and several other RFLPs that mapped to the same 300-bp region near the transmembrane coding region of the cDNA beta-chain, thus suggesting the presence of an insertion in this region that could affect insulin-receptor function. Genomic DNA fragments containing this RFLP were cloned from an individual heterozygous for the putative insertion, and the differing fragments of the two alleles were sequenced. The presence of a 400-bp insertion was thus confirmed and was demonstrated to be entirely within an intron. No significant coding-region differences from published cDNA sequences were detected in four exons sequenced from the region of the insertional allele. The sequenced regions included multiple Alu repeat sequences. The RFLP was unusual in that the larger allele consisted of an additional Alu repeat sequence that included a new Pst I site. Because the nature and location of the insertion did not suggest a role in insulin-receptor function, the association of this RFLP with NIDDM and hyperinsulinemia was reexamined in a small sample of Whites. No association could be demonstrated, and the insertion also failed to segregate with NIDDM in five White pedigrees.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To study collagen production as influenced separately by nutrition versus hormonal/metabolic factors, rats were given 50 mg/kg i.v. streptozocin (STZ) (mild weight-gaining diabetes) or 100 mg/kg STZ (severe weight-losing diabetes) and compared with nondiabetic food-restricted rats to match weight changes in diabetic animals. Articular cartilage was incubated with [3H]proline, and uptake of [3H]proline into both collagen and noncollagen proteins was determined with purified bacterial collagenase. Collagen decreased to 49% in mildly diabetic rats and 16% in severely diabetic rats, compared with control rats fed ad libitum and decreased to 85 and 73%, respectively, in food-restricted rats (both P less than .01 vs. diabetes). Diabetes induced a greater defect in collagen production than food restriction and a greater decrease in collagen than noncollagen protein production within each group, suggesting a specific effect on collagen. With comparable levels of metabolic severity (glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate), diabetic animals that lost weight produced significantly less collagen than animals that gained weight, suggesting separate mechanisms. Quantitation of the impact of undernutrition on collagen production in diabetes demonstrated that approximately 31 to 32% of the defect was due to undernutrition, leaving approximately 68-69% of the defect due to the diabetic state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of the two treatment groups were assessed by residents' performance in videotaped simulated sexual history interviews. Results strongly suggested that the skills oriented method was more effective than the awareness oriented method for teaching residents to take a sexual history. No residents elicited information about sexual orientation. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for teaching and research in sexual history taking skills.\r"

One hundred and four training exams performed with the assistance of an experienced gastroenterologist were compared with 118 unassisted post-training, post-residency exams. The mean depth of insertion for the post-training period was 51.1 +/- 1.2 cm, which was significantly greater (P less than .05, Student's t test) than the mean training period depth of 47.6 +/- 1.2 cm. There was no significant difference in the identification of polyps or cancer between the training and post-training periods. The mean duration of an exam was 17.3 +/- 0.6 minutes in the post-training period. No significant complications were encountered in either period. The residency trained family physicians obtained results similar to those reported by trained endoscopists in depth of examination and pathology detected, although their examinations required more time. We conclude that this model of training was effective in the development of flexible sigmoidoscopy procedural skill for family practice residents.\r"

The SIP was completed by the patient and the family physician on patients 55 years of age or older who were seen at a family practice residency clinic. The study used stratified, random assignment in an experimental design to compare physician and patient reaction to the SIP. Both physicians (residents and faculty) and patients felt the SIP was useful in detecting disabilities. Approximately half of the physicians felt the SIP was helpful in patient management. Patients reported twice as many disabilities as were reported by physicians. Half of the clinic physicians had the opportunity to review a patient's SIP immediately prior to a visit. They recognized more disabilities and agreed more often with the patients about the presence of a disability. The physicians felt the SIP was too lengthy to assimilate easily into the clinic setting. Use of a functional assessment instrument is advocated because of its ability to increase both physician awareness and physician-patient communication regarding the presence of a functional deficit.\r"

Leaders conclude with a discussion of the symptoms of fusion and develop strategies to avoid fusion during the therapeutic process. Within each phase, leaders present case examples and the participants in dyads proceed through the same process. By going through this process, participants will be better able to understand how family of origin dynamics affect the care they provide patients and why certain patients often prove to be difficult cases.\r"

This paper reports on a study conducted in a large group family practice in an urban academic setting to examine the frequency with which physicians were ordering mammograms for one age-appropriate group of female patients. The charts of a random sample of 88 females over age 55 who had been patients in the practice for at least five years were abstracted for information on mammography and breast examination as well as background clinical history. Within this sample, 56% had no mammograms recorded over the five-year study period, and only 19% had a mammogram within the most recently completed year. The average interval between mammograms over five years for subjects with one or more mammograms was 3.5 years. For 18% of all ordered mammograms the results could not be located in the chart. These findings suggest that family physicians need to improve adherence to recommended guidelines for mammography and to improve documentation of screening activities in the medical record.\r"

The plateau contact angle was not affected by the mode of drying. The intraobserver and interobserver coefficient of variation was less than 5%. The gastric mucosal surface had a higher mean contact angle than the submucosal surface (69 degrees vs. 47 degrees, p less than 0.001). Glycerol drops gave lower contact angles than saline drops (55 degrees vs. 69 degrees) but gave the same derived values for surface free energy (42 vs. 41 mJ/m2). Regional values for contact angle were as follows: gastric body 70 degrees, antrum 70 degrees, duodenal bulb 62 degrees (p less than 0.01 vs. stomach), distal duodenum 50 degrees (p less than 0.001 vs. stomach and p less than 0.01 vs. bulb), and rectum 57 degrees (p less than 0.001 vs. stomach). We conclude that it is feasible to measure the surface hydrophobicity of human endoscopic biopsy specimens and that the stomach is relatively more hydrophobic than the duodenum and rectum.\r"

  ".W": "Rapid epithelial restitution after superficial damage of the gastroduodenal mucosa consists of the migration of remaining intact epithelial cells beneath a necrotic layer of mucus and shed cells. Complete reepithelialization occurs within 60 min (rat stomach) to 7 h (rabbit duodenum) and does not involve cell division. The present study investigated rapid restitution of the acid-damaged rabbit duodenal mucosa in vitro under various conditions. Alkaline flux and transmucosal potential difference were measured simultaneously, and computerized morphometry was performed. Rapid restitution was nearly completed 5 h after damage at neutral luminal pH, but it was retarded when the luminal pH (pHL) was kept at 3. Removal of the necrotic layer did not impair restitution at neutral luminal pH but caused delay at acidic pH (pHL = 3.0). Removal of nutrient bicarbonate slightly delayed restitution at pHL = 7.4 and caused complete inhibition at pHL = 3.0. Alkaline secretion was usually stable but was nearly totally abolished after removal of nutrient bicarbonate. The potential difference decreased after acid damage and showed a tendency to recover in parallel with mucosal restitution. This gradual recovery correlated directly with morphometry. The authors assume that rapid restitution of the duodenal mucosa at an acidic luminal pH depends on the presence of a protective necrotic layer and sufficient alkaline secretion to maintain an optimal environment adjacent to the mucosa. Disturbance of this alkaline microenvironment could be important for the development and healing of duodenal ulcer.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study we have investigated the effect of sialoadenectomy in the rat on adaptive cytoprotection induced by intragastric instillation of an irritant concentration of ethanol (10% wt/vol). Gastric mucosae were examined 1 h after oral administration of 100% ethanol. In animals with intact salivary glands, pretreatment with saline was followed 15 min later by 100% ethanol. This treatment was associated with a significant degree of mucosal damage. However, prior administration of 10% ethanol in place of saline reduced the area of ulceration. In sialoadenectomized rats, the irritant concentration of ethanol did not protect the gastric mucosa from the damaging actions of absolute ethanol. The effect was partially restored if sialoadenectomized rats were treated for 3 days with an aqueous extract of rat salivary gland tissue. Histologic examination revealed no differences in the extent of epithelial damage or adherent mucus between rats with intact salivary glands and sialoadenectomized rats following pretreatment with either saline or 10% ethanol. Although adaptive cytoprotection in animals with intact salivary glands was not associated with increases in mucosal capacities for prostaglandin E2 or 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha biosynthesis, sialoadenectomy resulted in a reduction in the mucosal biosynthetic capacities for both prostanoids. Salivary gland extract administration to sialoadenectomized rats did not significantly alter mucosal prostaglandin biosynthesis levels. These data suggest that salivary gland factors affected adaptive cytoprotection induced by an irritant dose of ethanol. Although endogenous prostaglandin biosynthesis capabilities do not appear to be altered in adaptive cytoprotection, salivary factors appear to influence mucosal generation of prostaglandins.\r"

This study documents this finding and compares anorectal function in these 35 patients with 25 matched normal subjects and the remaining 105 incontinent patients. Basal and squeeze pressures were significantly lower in the incontinent study group than in the other two groups. During rectal distention, 25 of 35 patients showed no anal relaxation at any volume, whereas 10 patients showed some relaxation after 60-ml distention because of the postinflation rebound in internal anal sphincter tone. The electrical responses of the external anal sphincter to rectal distention and to increases in intraabdominal pressure were greater in patients than in normal subjects, but the anal pressures were lower and anal leakage was common. Rectal sensations were not significantly different from normal subjects. These results indicate that 25% of patients with idiopathic fecal incontinence have markedly impaired function of the internal anal sphincter, but these patients also have extremely weak external sphincters.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatocellular carcinoma is closely associated with cirrhosis, but it also develops, although much less frequently, in a noncirrhotic liver. It is suspected, without supporting evidence, that hepatocellular carcinoma has a different etiology when associated and not associated with chronic liver disease. In this study, 66 noncirrhotic cases found among 618 autopsies for hepatocellular carcinoma (10.7%) were analyzed retrospectively. The noncirrhotic liver was histologically unremarkable in 3 cases and in the histologically evaluable 56 cases it had fibrosis of varying degrees or mild cellular infiltrate, or both, in the portal tract. There was one liver that had portal venous changes compatible with those in idiopathic portal hypertension (Banti's syndrome). In these noncirrhotic livers, the parenchymal cells were generally unremarkable except for liver cell dysplasia that was seen in 26.8%. Serum hepatitis B surface antigen was positive in only 7.4% in contrast to 26.6% in cirrhotic cases. Three histologically unremarkable cases had no clinical or histologic evidence of chronic liver disease; two involved painter-plasterers and one a farmer. The liver weight in these cases ranged from 4400 to 6180 g. In contrast, the average liver weight in cirrhotic cases was 1998 g. Noncirrhotic patients when compared with cirrhotic patients had better liver function tests and much less frequent varices. It was concluded that approximately 11% of hepatocellular carcinoma cases in Japan are noncirrhotic, the majority having some histologic changes in the portal tracts suggestive of past or ongoing chronic liver disease, and that there are rare cases that have no histologic changes in the liver.\r"

To evaluate the reality of this association, the prevalence of hemangioma was studied in 26 patients with focal nodular hyperplasia by comparison with 27 patients with hepatocellular adenoma. All of these patients underwent surgery, which provided the histologic confirmation of the type of tumor. The presence of hemangioma was assessed by preoperative ultrasonography, dynamic computed tomography, and pathological examination of resected liver specimens. No hemangioma was found in patients with hepatocellular adenoma, but 6 of the 26 patients with focal nodular hyperplasia (23%) had one or two associated hemangiomas that varied in size from 1.5 to 4 cm. All 6 patients having focal nodular hyperplasia and hemangioma were women who had previously used oral contraceptives. None of the patients who had not used oral contraceptives had this association. Moreover, oral contraceptives were taken for a significantly longer period by the women with focal nodular hyperplasia and hemangioma than by those without this association. It is concluded that (a) the association of hemangioma with focal nodular hyperplasia is frequent (23%) and not fortuitous, and (b) prolonged administration of oral contraceptives may facilitate the recognition of this association, possibly by affecting the growth of these tumors.\r"

Proteins were biosynthetically labeled and further identified by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Apoproteins in culture supernatants were identified by density gradient ultracentrifugation and by one- and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of aliquots of the gradient. Rat plasma was processed in the same way and used for comparison. Fat-storing cells synthesized and secreted apoprotein E, apoprotein A-I, apoprotein A-IV, and low amounts of apoprotein C. The synthesis of these proteins increased during the culture time, reaching a maximum at the fifth day after isolation. The proteins were identified mostly as apoproteins of high-density lipoprotein. Hepatocytes synthesized and secreted apoproteins of all classes of lipoproteins. The distribution of high-density lipoprotein apoproteins was similar to that of fat-storing cells but hepatocytes produced larger amounts of the apoproteins.\r"

Purified mucin eluted primarily in the void volume of a Sepharose 2B-Cl column, indicating a molecular weight above 2 x 10(6). Disaggregation of the mucin polymer resulted in the elution of glycoprotein in the included volume of the Sepharose 2B-Cl column. Gallbladder mucin had a hydrodynamic radius of 630 A that was independent of mucin concentration below 2 mg/ml. At mucin concentrations above 2 mg/ml, a concentration-dependent increase in both hydrodynamic radius and apparent viscosity of gallbladder mucin was observed. Mucin demonstrated a strong pH dependence in hydrodynamic radius and viscosity with the maximum occurring at approximately pH 5.5. These findings suggest that noncovalent interactions participate in bovine gallbladder mucin subunit associations. Furthermore, changes that occur in the physicochemical environment of the gallbladder during periods of stasis may enhance the viscoelastic properties of mucin and promote the accumulation of biliary sludge in the gallbladder.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils have an important role in mediating tissue injury in inflammatory bowel disease. The proinflammatory peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), which is produced by intestinal bacteria, is a potent chemotactic factor for human neutrophils and has been used experimentally to induce acute colitis in animal models. Its action involves specific receptors on the surface of the neutrophil. Increased mucosal permeability, which has been described in Crohn's disease, might contribute to the pathogenesis of the intestinal lesions in this disease by means of increased absorption of FMLP and other gut-derived bacterial products. To evaluate the interaction between FMLP and neutrophils in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, we have studied the binding characteristics and responsiveness of circulating neutrophils to this peptide. Neutrophils from patients with Crohn's disease but not those with ulcerative colitis were found to have significantly increased numbers of receptors for FMLP with similar affinity constants. This was associated with a significantly increased functional response to FMLP in chemiluminescence assays. Differences in neutrophils between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are probably not intrinsic to the neutrophil but reflect their conditioning by the different inflammatory milieu of these diseases.\r"

  ".W": "The immunopathologic, structural, and functional changes within rectal mucosa of known celiac sprue subjects were quantitated during local challenge with a peptic-tryptic digest of gluten. In the celiac sprue patients challenged with 2 g of digest, major effects occurred in lamina propria, submucosa, and local microvasculature. The lamina propria swelling was biphasic, starting 1-2 h after challenge with widespread extravascular deposition of fibrinogen, indicative of increased microvascular permeability, receding by 24 h postchallenge. A rapid fall in mast cells together with granule discharge suggested their involvement in this response. The late-phase swelling (48-72 h) was preceded by a rapid influx of neutrophils and basophils, the latter showing evidence of degranulation beyond 72 h. Reestablishment of vessel lumina, a rise in mast cells, and loss of neutrophils indicated tapering of the inflammatory cellular cascade by 96 h. Lymphocytes, first seen to enter the lamina by 2 h postchallenge, increased progressively, thereby resulting in substantial infiltration between 36 and 96 h. A marked rise in epithelial lymphocytes, maximal at 6-8 h, waned by 24 h. Volumes of surface and crypt epithelium remained constant throughout. In another challenge series with 4 g of gluten digest, electrical potential difference across rectal mucosa decreased significantly 12 h postchallenge, but the associated decreases in net sodium and chloride absorptive fluxes were insignificant. It is concluded that rectal mucosa is sensitized to gluten in celiac sprue disease and thus offers a promising and convenient in vivo substrate for investigative and diagnostic purposes.\r"

The metabolism of this compound, however, has not been studied in detail. In this paper we provide evidence that 5-aminosalicylic acid is acetylated to N-acetyl-aminosalicylic acid in homogenates from colonic biopsy specimens (370 +/- 20 nmol/g wet wt or 2.9 +/- 0.9 nmol/mg.min, n = 10), whereas acetylation in fecal samples was only small (13.0 +/- 3.0 nmol/g). Mucosal N-acetylation was rapid, cofactor- and pH-dependent, and could be enriched in the cytosolic fraction. In contrast, fecal acetylation was slow and did not depend on the presence of acetyl-coenzyme A. There were neither significant differences of acetylation between patients and controls nor a significant correlation to the individual acetylation phenotype. From our results we believe that presystemic acetylation of 5-aminosalicylic acid may be mainly mediated by a colonic mucosal enzyme and only to a small extent by fecal (bacterial) processes.\r"

The basal blood flow of the mucosa plus submucosa, muscularis propria, and the whole wall was significantly higher in the lower esophageal sphincter than in the proximal or the distal body. Intravenous nifedipine caused a similar decrease in vascular tone of the mucosa and the muscularis propria in all sites of the esophagus. Isoproterenol infusion significantly decreased the vascular tone of the mucosa with columnar epithelium (i.e., mucosa overlying the lower esophageal sphincter), but not of the mucosa with squamous epithelium (i.e., mucosa overlying the body). In the muscularis propria the vasodilatory effect of isoproterenol and nifedipine was significant at all sites, but this effect was greater in the striated muscle of the body than in the smooth muscle of the lower esophageal sphincter (p less than 0.05). Thus, not only do different vasodilators have different effects on the vasculature of the esophagus, but also a single agent may have differing effects on the various sites and layers of this organ.\r"

All currently identifiable endocrine cell types were detected by 10 wk of gestation. Immunostaining for the endocrine cell marker chromogranin revealed abundant endocrine cells in the earliest specimens (8 wk of gestation) with a relatively higher frequency in both proximal duodenum and distal colon/rectum compared with other areas. Quantification of endocrine cells showed an increase with age that was roughly parallel to the growth of the gut as a whole. These studies show that the diversity of the endocrine component of the gut appears to be established by 10 wk of gestation and that gut activity is preceded by the development of a fully differentiated endocrine component, which may subserve or even initiate the onset of functional maturity.\r"

Mucin (tissue content and secretion) was measured using a highly specific enzyme-linked immunoassay. In contrast to the increased protein to deoxyribonucleic acid ratio, an absolute decrease was observed in the mucin to deoxyribonucleic acid ratio in mucosal homogenates of the diabetic intestine. This was not due to a loss of goblet cells as their numbers per crypt-villus unit increased in diabetic rats (in proportion to the rise in enterocyte numbers and crypt-villus length). Histochemically, goblet cell mucin was unchanged in diabetes. After a 90-min incubation of everted intestinal segments in Krebs' buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 degrees C, the amount of mucin released into the medium was the same in diabetic and control rats when expressed relative to tissue deoxyribonucleic acid. However, secreted mucin represented a significantly larger proportion of the total tissue mucin content in diabetic animals. Thus, to maintain mucin output at normal levels, the rate of mucin secretion is apparently increased in the diabetic intestine, despite (or perhaps causing) a large decrease in the tissue mucin content.\r"

In this study, the effects of intravenous atropine on the antropyloroduodenal motor responses to intraduodenal infusions of 25% dextrose were assessed in 10 normal volunteers. Antropyloroduodenal pressures were recorded with a manometric assembly incorporating a sleeve sensor spanning the pylorus, and sideholes in the antrum and duodenum. In each experiment, three intraduodenal infusions of 25% dextrose were given at a rate of 4 ml/min, for a median duration of 19 min (range 17-20). During the second dextrose infusion, intravenous atropine was given as a bolus (15 micrograms/kg) followed by an infusion (4 micrograms/kg.min), which was continued until the end of each experiment. Before atropine was given, the pyloric motor response to the second dextrose infusion was not significantly different from the response to the first infusion, but after administration of atropine there was a rapid decrease in the rate of isolated pyloric pressure waves, from 0.8 to 0.1 per minute (p less than 0.05). The isolated pyloric pressure wave response to the third dextrose infusion was completely blocked, and there was a much smaller maximum increase in basal pyloric pressure compared with the first infusion (p less than 0.01). This study indicates that intraduodenal dextrose reproducibly stimulates isolated pyloric pressure waves and increases basal pyloric pressure by mechanisms that involve muscarinic receptors.\r"

Eleven patients were studied at least 7 mo after operation, by which time they had lost 31% +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) of their excess body weight. Stomal diameter, volume, and distensibility of the proximal gastric pouch were determined by a balloon distention technique. Gastric emptying was monitored scintigraphically both with and without distention of the proximal pouch. Stomal diameters ranged from 10 to 15 mm (mean +/- SEM = 11 +/- 1 mm), and pouch capacity ranged from 20 to 150 ml (76 +/- 9 ml). Mean intrapouch pressure was 13 mmHg before distention, increased to 22 mmHg with distention to half-maximal capacity, and then changed little with further distention to maximum capacity. Near maximal pouch distention during gastric emptying of a 300-ml test meal decreased antral contractile activity and speeded the initial rate of emptying (t25 with distention = 14 +/- 3 min vs. 24 +/- 3 min without distention, p less than 0.03), but did not alter the later rate of emptying. No clear-cut relationship was present between weight loss and stomal diameter, pouch volume, or gastric emptying. The conclusion was that distention of the proximal gastric pouch created by vertical banded gastroplasty inhibited antral contractions and increased the initial rate of gastric emptying, but no clear-cut correlation was found in this cohort between weight loss after the operation and stomal diameter, pouch size, and gastric emptying.\r"

  ".W": "Breast cancer is a disease of elderly as well as middle-aged women. Even in patients of advanced age, breast cancer shortens life expectancy. Early diagnosis, through preventative screening with mammography and physical examination, offers the best hope of cure. Deterrents to use of mammography have included radiation risk, unnecessary biopsies, and cost. However, current low radiation doses minimize radiation risks; test specificity is much better in older women, leading to fewer unnecessary biopsies; and new Medicare guidelines lower out-of-pocket patient cost. With increased education of older women and health care providers, methods to decrease mortality from breast cancer in the elderly can become widespread.\r"

This is partly because the elderly have more chronic medical conditions and decreased homeostatic reserve. Pharmacotherapy must be individualized, since the elderly are widely variable, and drugs must be carefully monitored to minimize risk of poor outcomes. The clinician must remember that drugs are only one of the available interventions in geriatric care and that their use entails not only potential for benefit but also considerable risk. It is the clinician's responsibility to practice in such a way that this risk is minimized.\r"

The elderly hypertensive group showed a significantly lower cardiac index and higher total peripheral resistance. beta-Receptor sensitivity, as determined by chronotropic dose of infused isoproterenol, and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity index, derived from phase II, but not phase IV, of Valsalva's maneuver, were only slightly but significantly reduced in the hypertensive group. The variability of heart rate at rest as an index of parasympathetic control of heart was similar between these two groups. Plasma norepinephrine level was significantly inversely related to resting mean blood pressure (r = -0.31, p less than 0.05) when analyzed as a whole group. Plasma renin activity, but not plasma aldosterone, was significantly decreased in the hypertensive group. To define the effects of age itself, these parameters in normotensive elderly subjects were also compared with those in 12 young normotensive subjects (mean age, 23 years). Although resting hemodynamic measurements did not differ, various circulatory autonomic functions were significantly different between these two age groups. The variability of heart rate in 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, beta-receptor responsiveness, resting vagal cardiac activity, and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity derived from phase IV of Valsalva's maneuver were significantly depressed in the elderly. Resting plasma norepinephrine level was elevated and renin-aldosterone system decreased in the elderly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since age-specific countertransport values were consistently higher for men than women, all analyses were done for men and women separately. In simple correlation analyses, countertransport was significantly related to systolic and diastolic BP in both sexes (r values 0.107-0.163). In age-adjusted analyses, countertransport was significantly related to BP level of both men and women not receiving antihypertensive treatment; mean levels were high for hypertensive persons receiving antihypertensive therapy compared with normotensive persons. Age-adjusted prevalence rates of hypertension were progressively higher for both sexes in successively higher quintiles of countertransport, almost twice as high for those in the highest quintile compared with those in the lowest quintile. Correspondingly, age-adjusted logistic regression analyses showed countertransport to be related significantly to prevalence of hypertension for both men and women (p less than 0.001). Since age, body mass index, plasma total cholesterol, uric acid, glucose, urinary sodium/potassium excretion, pulse, and (for men) daily alcohol intake also were significantly correlated with BP, and in some instances with countertransport, relation of countertransport to BP was also assessed in multivariate analyses with control for these variables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied the effects of 1 week of oral hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) on blood pressure, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, forearm vascular resistance, and norepinephrine spillover to plasma in eight healthy male volunteers. Although diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged, systolic blood pressure increased from 119 to 135 mm Hg (SED +/- 3.4, p less than 0.01), associated with an increased cardiac output (5.85-7.73 l/min, SED +/- 0.46, p less than 0.01). Total peripheral vascular resistance fell from 15.1 to 12.2 mm Hg/l/min (SED +/- 1.03, p less than 0.05). Resting forearm vascular resistance remained unchanged, but the reflex response to the cold pressor test was accentuated, the rise in resistance increasing from 10.5 mm Hg/ml/100 ml/min (R units) before treatment to 32.6 R units after treatment (SED +/- 6.4, p less than 0.025). The rise in forearm vascular resistance accompanying intra-arterial norepinephrine (25, 50, and 100 ng/min) was also significantly greater after hydrocortisone, increasing from an average of 14.9 +/- 2.4 R units before treatment to 35.1 +/- 5.5 R units after hydrocortisone (SED +/- 6.0, p less than 0.05). A shift to the left in the dose-response relation and fall in threshold suggested increased sensitivity to norepinephrine after treatment. Measurement of resting norepinephrine spillover rate to plasma and norepinephrine uptake indicated that overall resting sympathetic nervous system activity was not increased. The rise in resting blood pressure with hydrocortisone is associated with an increased cardiac output (presumably due to increased blood volume).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Renal phospholipase A2 activity increased and membranous phospholipids especially phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, decreased with age in SHRSP. Arachidonate in phospholipid also decreased with age in SHRSP. To determine the effect of pressure load on the lipid alterations in renal membrane, SHRSP that received antihypertensive treatment with hydralazine, enalapril, or nicardipine for 5 weeks were compared with those without treatment. Antihypertensive treatments prevented phospholipid degradation and increased arachidonate in phospholipid relative to the control group. Phospholipase A2 activity in each group treated with antihypertensive drugs did not differ from that in the control group. These results suggest that the course of hypertension causes renal membranous phospholipid degradation and increases phospholipase A2 activity. Antihypertensive treatments may prevent these lipid alterations in SHRSP. These renal membranous structural changes may provide an explanation not only for functional abnormalities such as decreased membrane fluidity but also for the progress of hypertension.\r"

Noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, neuropeptide Y, and chromogranins A and B were significantly higher in adrenal glands of SHRSP than those of WKY rats at 4 months. At 12 months, the levels of these components in SHRSP had increased even more (about 200% in WKY rats). There was no change in the relative composition of the adrenal \"secretory cocktail.\" Neither the chromogranin A/chromogranin B ratio nor their apparent proteolytic processing in chromaffin granules differed between SHRSP or WKY rats. The lack of a significant change in membrane-bound cytochrome b561 and the small increase in dopamine beta-hydroxylase suggest that the higher levels of secretory components in SHRSP are not simply caused by an increase in the number of chromaffin granules, but possibly by a selective increase in the secretory content of these organelles providing a larger package for quantal release by exocytosis. This may be relevant for the elevation of blood pressure in this strain. The immunological methods described in this paper allow for the first time a determination of the secretory quantal levels in catecholamine storage. This should be useful for further studies in hypertensive models.\r"

Two ages were examined: 45 and 78-80 weeks of age. SHR and WKY rats did not differ in frequency of polyploid cells at any mesenteric branch level at either age. Although hypertension per se seemed not to be a factor, both species showed increased numbers of polyploid cells with aging at certain branch levels of the mesenteric arterial tree.

In the apex-ejecting, isolated, pyruvate-perfused working hearts of WKY rats and SHR, coronary flow was constant when coronary perfusion pressure was set between 140 and 190 cm H2O (range of autoregulation). Coronary flow was perfusion pressure dependent when the coronary perfusion pressure was set below 110 cm H2O for both WKY rats and SHR. Cardiac output, developed pressure, rate of pressure development (dP/dt), and oxygen consumption were constant in the range of autoregulation but decreased in the direction of coronary flow when coronary flow was reduced by a drop in perfusion pressure. Similarly, the phosphorylation potential, phosphocreatine, adenosine triphosphate, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate were constant in the range of autoregulation but decreased directionally with coronary perfusion pressure below 110 cm H2O for both SHR and WKY rats. There was a significantly lower phosphorylation potential in SHR as compared with WKY rats when coronary perfusion pressure was reduced to 80 cm H2O. In the region of autoregulation, coronary flow and oxygen consumption were significantly less in SHR, although developed pressure was significantly greater at both high and low workloads.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The numbers of prescriptions and the diagnostic and drug treatment information were obtained from the National Prescription Audit (Ambler, Pa, IMS America, 1985) the National Disease and Therapeutic Index (Ambler, Pa, IMS America, 1985), ongoing surveys of pharmacies, and office-based physicians. We adjusted drug-use data for the fact that several antihypertensive drugs also have other uses. During the study period, the annual numbers of prescriptions for treatment of hypertension progressively increased from 128.1 to 208.6 million, an average change of 5% per year. In 1973, the three leading classes of antihypertensive drugs were thiazide diuretic agents, peripheral neuronal inhibitors, and central alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulators. By 1985, the thiazide drugs were still the leader, followed by beta-adrenergic receptor blockers and potassium-sparing diuretic drugs. The use trends presented are consistent with surveys indicating increased drug therapy of hypertension from 1960 to the present.\r"

In 1984, the third Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) for the first time suggested an alternative initial treatment with a beta-blocker in selected hypertensive patients, and the fourth JNC report has recommended the alternatives of calcium channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for step-one therapy as well. However, only the diuretic drugs and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in prospective, long-term, controlled trials. Moreover, 30 years' experience with diuretic agents and 20 years' experience with beta-blockers have defined the advantages, disadvantages, and potential side effects of these drugs more precisely than is possible for newer agents. The diuretic drugs and beta-blockers remain excellent choices in the management of hypertension.\r"

Other factors related to blood pressure like obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy as demonstrated on electrocardiograms, and heart enlargement as shown by x-ray radiography made several selective additional independent contributions to risk; heart enlargement by x-ray radiography was the best predictor of congestive heart failure.\r"

Five classes of agents, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium entry blockers, peripheral alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blockers, and thiazide diuretic agents, are all appropriate monotherapy in properly selected patients. The choice depends on efficacy, side effects, demography, comorbidity, dosage schedule, cost, mechanism of drug action, and the pathophysiology of the patient's hypertension. Extensive data are now available that will assist the clinician in choosing an agent that has the greatest probability of success without the need for extensive biochemical or hemodynamic evaluation.\r"

When nonpharmacological treatment of hypertension fails, initial drug treatment with diuretic drugs, sympatholytic agents (including beta-adrenergic receptor blockers), or vasodilators will result in satisfactory blood pressure control. However, each of these therapies has effects that are independent of their antihypertensive activity and that should be considered before a selection is made for initial therapy. The adverse effects of diuretic agents and beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking drugs on plasma lipid profiles may diminish the beneficial effects of blood pressure reduction. On the other hand, the hypocholesterolemic effect of alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists, the potential cardioprotective effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and the salutary effects of calcium channel blockers on left ventricular function are responses that would support the use of vasodilatory therapy. Vasodilating antihypertensive drugs may be more beneficial than \"standard\" therapy and should be considered for the initial treatment of newly diagnosed hypertensive patients.\r"

Future research should center on more precise delineation of cardiovascular risk, evaluation of alternative environmental manipulations to reduce blood pressure, enhanced understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of hypertension, better matching of antihypertensive drug therapy to pathophysiology, development of new drugs that not only lower blood pressure but also provide additional benefits with minimal side effects, and finally, investigations to further our understanding of the behavioral aspects of the physician-patient encounter, as well as studies on compliance and other issues that influence therapeutic outcome.\r"

The risk of renal disease in patients with milder forms of hypertension is less certain. Death certificate, insurance industry, and community-based observational studies provide little information with respect to the risk of kidney damage in the hypertensive patient. Randomized controlled trials of antihypertensive drug therapy provide equivocal results. The strongest evidence in support of the hypothesis that mild hypertension increases the risk of subsequent renal disease comes from analyses of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program and the Medicare End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Program. The risk of blood pressure-related ESRD appears to be especially high in blacks, independent of age, sex, and prevalence of hypertension. Although these results need to be confirmed, the data raise the possibility that the effects of high blood pressure on the kidney are different in blacks than in whites. Based on current trends, it is projected that the number of beneficiaries in the Medicare ESRD Program will continue to increase during the next 30-40 years and that the diagnosis of hypertensive ESRD will become increasingly common. Additional studies to characterize the relation between mild hypertension and subsequent risk of renal disease and to confirm the corresponding benefits of antihypertensive therapy are urgently needed.\r"

  ".W": "Among the 356,222 men screened for the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial who had no history of hospitalization for heart attack at entry, more than 2,000 coronary deaths occurred during 6 years of follow-up. With this large data set, detailed cross-tabulations clearly and simply showed the strong graded relation between blood pressure and coronary heart disease death. This risk gradient was evident in each of five age groups ranging from 35 to 57 years and for levels of diastolic blood pressure ranging from less than 75 mm Hg to greater than 115 mm Hg. Systolic blood pressure was more strongly associated with coronary heart disease death than was diastolic blood pressure, and isolated systolic blood pressure elevation was found to be an important risk factor in these middle-aged men. The risk of coronary death was increased among hypertensive men who had elevated serum cholesterol levels or who smoked cigarettes. Because less than 10% of hypertensive men had cholesterol levels in the lowest quintile (below 182 mg/dl) and were nonsmokers, a multi-intervention approach for the large majority of hypertensive persons is clearly indicated. Risks of death were also substantially increased among those hypertensive men who already had end-organ damage, emphasizing the importance of early treatment to prevent such damage. These findings have implications for the design of prevention trials and clinical practice, as it is clear that systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure should be considered in treating hypertensive patients. Additionally, treatment goals should be directed at preventing not only death but many other morbid events, clinical and subclinical, that are associated with elevated blood pressure and that are preventable with appropriate treatment.\r"

For most age-sex-race subgroups, the frequency of medication use during 1982-1984 was higher than that observed during 1976-1980 based on the NHANES II. In the interval 1982-1984, diuretic agents were the most frequent medications prescribed (47% of drugs prescribed), and beta-blockers were second (17%). At the time of the initial survey in 1971-1975, participants had their blood pressures measured and a history of diagnosis and treatment of hypertension ascertained. Follow-up for vital status was 93% complete by 1984 (average length of follow-up, 9 years). In white men and women aged 50 years and older, the relative risk of death increased steadily, from those with elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg) but no history of hypertension to those treated for hypertension but whose blood pressure was still elevated. Regardless of history or treatment, those with an elevated blood pressure had about a 25-30% excess risk of death. Evidence from these national studies shows a high frequency of antihypertensive drug therapy in 1982-1984 and suggests the importance of adequate blood pressure control for optimal survival.\r"

The risk of any of these manifestations is also modified by other risk factors. Tobacco smoking affects the risk for all of the previously mentioned end points. Generally, lipid disturbances are only important predictors of coronary heart disease and total mortality. Several facts indicate that elevated blood pressure is causally related to the end points. There are, however, positive relations between blood pressure levels and heart rate, serum cholesterol level, body mass index, and, according to some studies, glucose intolerance. Some more basic abnormality may be responsible for the blood pressure increase and the increases in these other factors. Hypothetically, this abnormality may be more fundamentally related to some of the end points than is hypertension itself. If that is the case, then the type of antihypertensive treatment may be of decisive importance. Different end points may be affected differently by antihypertensive drugs, a factor that may be essential in the choice of drug treatment. Proper management of other risk factors is also essential in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.\r"

The results indicate that a prolonged difference of about 6 mm Hg in DBP was associated with approximately 37% fewer strokes and 23% fewer CHD deaths and nonfatal myocardial infarctions. The effects of equivalent reductions in DBP produced by antihypertensive drug treatment but maintained for only a few years have been estimated in several overviews of randomized trials involving a total of 30,000-40,000 patients. The results of the overviews indicate that treatment reduced the risk of stroke by about 40%, suggesting that most or all the long-term potential benefits for stroke due to lower DBP were achieved within about 3 years of beginning treatment. The risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death may have been reduced by about 10% among patients allocated to active treatment; the 95% confidence limits for the difference ranged from about zero to about 20%. Whatever the true effect of treatment on CHD, it would appear somewhat less than the difference in risk estimated from the observational studies for a prolonged difference in DBP of the same size. This apparent shortfall in benefit may reflect a long time-course for changes in DBP to have their full effects on CHD, possible adverse side effects of the principal trial treatments, or both.\r"

In the Medical Research Council trial, bendrofluazide (10 mg daily) was compared with a dose of propranolol (as much as 240 mg daily), a nonselective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Two selective beta-blockers, atenolol (100 mg daily) and metoprolol (200 mg daily), were compared with bendrofluazide (5-10 mg daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (50-100 mg daily) in the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension trial. In the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension, 160 mg of slow-release oxprenolol, a beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was compared with a diuretic-based regimen not containing beta-blockers. In each trial, similar reductions in mean diastolic blood pressure were achieved with diuretic and beta-blocker treatment that lasted for several years. All-cause mortality and fatal and nonfatal stroke and coronary event rates were also similar in the treatment groups. Thus, it appears that beta-blockers are as effective as diuretic agents in improving survival and in preventing major morbid events. Regarding cigarette smoking and stroke incidence, observations based on post hoc subgroup analyses of the Medical Research Council trial were not supported by subgroup findings in the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension and the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension trials, and these observations should not form the basis for any treatment recommendations.\r"

The observation of all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates in the group ultimately selected to participate in the trial is suggested as an index to the general applicability of trial results. Because end-point rates are fundamental for determining sample size, substantial reduction in these end-point rates by patient exclusion should be taken into account by the trial design. Some recent trials may have generated end-point--event rates so low that the power of the trial to detect reasonable treatment effects was substantially reduced. Future trials should attempt to take this important factor into account at the design stage.\r"

It has been widely assumed that an increase in the rate of treatment of hypertension is the most likely explanation for this major public health achievement. An analysis of available information, however, suggests that improvements in the community control of hypertension in the United States in the period 1970-1980 have contributed in only a minor way. There were 45,357 fewer deaths from stroke in 1980 among those aged 35-74 years than might have been expected if the death rates had stayed the same as in 1970. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Surveys indicate that six million more people received antihypertensive medication in 1980 than in 1970. Results from a pooled analysis of nine randomized controlled trials of the treatment of hypertension suggest that between 6% and 16% of the reduction in stroke mortality was due to the increased treatment of hypertension. Epidemiological observations indicate that between 16% and 25% of the overall decline in stroke mortality can be attributed to the treatment of hypertension, suggesting that clinical trials probably underestimate the community-wide benefits of treatment. These results also suggest that at least three quarters of the decline in stroke mortality in the United States in the period 1970-1980 is due to factors other than antihypertensive treatment.\r"

Examination of the national death statistics reveals decreases in congestive heart failure mortality at younger ages with mortality increases at older ages. The reasons for these divergent trends in congestive heart failure mortality in different ages and the apparent inconsistency with respect to the changes in the use of antihypertensive drugs are explored. We speculate that antihypertensive treatment does not completely prevent congestive heart failure but merely postpones its development by several decades.\r"

  ".W": "The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program followed up 10,940 persons for 5 years in a community-based, randomized, controlled trial of treatment for hypertension. Participants were randomized to one of two treatment groups, stepped care and referred care. The primary end point of the study was all-cause mortality, with morbid events involving the heart, brain, and kidney as secondary end points. Loss of renal function, ascertained by a change in serum creatinine, was among these secondary events. Baseline serum creatinine concentration had a significant prognostic value for 8-year mortality. For persons with a serum creatinine concentration greater than or equal to 1.7 mg/dl, 8-year mortality was more than three times that of all other participants. The estimated 5-year incidence of substantial decline in renal function was 21.7/1,000 in the stepped-care group and 24.6/1,000 in the referred-care group. Among persons with a baseline serum creatinine level between 1.5 and 1.7 mg/dl, the 5-year incidence of decline was 113.3/1,000 (stepped care) and 226.6/1,000 (referred care) (p less than 0.01). The incidence of decline in renal function was greater in men, blacks, and older adults, as well as in those with higher entry diastolic blood pressure. Among persons with a baseline serum creatinine level greater than or equal to 1.7 mg/dl, serum creatinine concentration declined by 25% or more in 28.6% of stepped-care and 25.2% of referred-care participants. Although the incidence of clinically significant hypercreatininemia in a hypertensive population is low, an elevated serum creatinine concentration is a very potent independent risk factor for mortality. The slightly lower rate of development of hypercreatininemia and the higher rate of improvement in stepped-care compared with referred-care participants is consistent with the belief that aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce renal damage and the associated increased risk of death.\r"

The association of mortality with SES among hypertensive subjects was eliminated by the HDFP stepped-care program. A large portion of the efficacy of the HDFP was associated with in-trial blood pressure control. Inasmuch as these results are generalizable to the nation, a large fraction of hypertension-associated morbidity and mortality in the United States was related to lower SES in the 1970s, before widespread implementation of programs resulting in increased awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension.\r"

Dietary measures should be effective in preventing the rise in blood pressure with age in civilized populations, but there are no firm data to substantiate this hypothesis. However, some data do suggest that weight loss and sodium restriction may benefit the drug-treated hypertensive patient. There are strong reasons to consider the use of nonpharmacological measures for the treatment of mild hypertension. Mild hypertension is ubiquitous. Some population subsets have a prevalence of mild hypertension approaching 40%, based on one blood pressure determination, for individuals older than 50 years. Even if the true prevalence is closer to 15%, this is a high proportion of the population in need of drug therapy. If a change in lifestyle could reduce the need for drug therapy by a respectable percentage, then an enormous number of individuals could be spared the necessity of taking antihypertensive medication.\r"

Three patients were found also to be suffering from discal and bone alterations of the dorsal column, and in two other patients the vertebral bodies L4-L5 were changed. Typical radiological pictures showed a narrowing of intervertebral spaces with the destruction or sclerosis of adjacent subchondral bones, erosions of vertebral body plates and cavitations. CT studies of the altered spines confirmed discal lesions and osteolytic areas with bone condensation at each level. Ligamentous lesions resulting in severe disorders of spinal statics were discovered during autopsy of three patients. Histological study of disc and peridiscal ligaments indicated the presence of large amyloid deposits containing beta-2-microglobulin (B2-m). It is possible that the minor biocompatibility of the cuprophan membrane of dialyzers is the most significant factor responsible for the hyperproduction of B2-m and thus of the osteo-articular deposition of a new type of amyloidosis.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted chronic experiments to determine how to treat profound biventricular failure systematically with ventricular assist devices (VADs) and to analyze the factors that affect prognoses for this condition. Anoxic arrest was induced in ten goats by aortic cross-clamping under normothermic conditions (38.5 degrees C) for 30 (n = 3), 45 (n = 1), and 60 (n = 6) minutes. A left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was implanted in eight animals, and a biventricular assist device (BVAD) was used in two. Three goats--two of which had undergone anoxic arrest for 30 minutes and one for 60 minutes--whose right atrial pressure (RAP) was approximately 18 mm Hg during the acute stage, recovered in two to three weeks, and the pumps were successfully removed. Pathological findings in these animals showed scattered areas of surviving myocardium, with connective tissue replacing the degenerated myocardium. The remaining five LVAD goats required higher RAPs to maintain circulation and died from various causes. Maintaining circulation without volume loading, even in the presence of arrhythmias, was easier with the BVAD. One BVAD animal that underwent 45 minutes of anoxic arrest recovered from right ventricular failure, and the right pump was removed. The second goat (anoxic arrest, 60 min) on the BVAD failed to recover. Autopsy of the myocardium revealed a thin ventricular wall. Our studies show that the use of VADs allows time for a failing heart to recover, but the potential for healing is affected by the severity of myocardial damage prior to VAD application.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The project includes three test fields: general basis, development and definition of test methods and test devices and comparative in vitro assessment of valves for the definition of minimum requirements. A preliminary list of test parameters and test steps has been defined: geometrical, flow, deformation, force, and conditioning parameters. A system of geometrical parameters has been developed for standardized aortic models. Geometrical parameters of 31 valves of six types and different sizes underline a close correlation between geometrical and hemodynamic parameters. The relative ostium cross-section Ae/AT increases with valve size and lies between 0.3 and 0.5. Two new measurement devices with quasi-steady flow are proposed as quick testers for leakage flow and pressure loss.\r"

The velocity and turbulent shear stress profiles of the valves were determined by Laser Doppler anemometry in two different downstream axes within a model aortic root. Depending on the individual valve design, velocity peaks up to 1.5 m/s and turbulent shear stress peaks up to 150 N/m2 were measured during the systolic phase. These shear stress peaks mainly occurred in areas of flow separation and intense momentum exchange. Directly downstream of the valves (measuring axis 0.55.dAorta) turbulent shear stress peaks occurred at peak systole and during the deceleration phase, while in the second measuring axis (1.5.dAorta) turbulence levels were lower. Shear stress levels were high at the borders of the fluid jets. The results are discussed from a fluid-dynamic point of view.\r"

Decentralized administration, participatory management, high rate of CCRN certification, all-registered nurse staff, and high nurse-physician collaboration were present. Organizational and clinical outcomes were positive: high satisfaction, low turnover, low mortality ratio, no new complications, high patient satisfaction. The proportion of charges for nursing-controlled factors was low compared with proportion of total stay spent in the unit. Aspects of structure, process, and outcome can be measured simultaneously in critical care; these measurements indicate that positive organizational and clinical outcomes coexist with valued aspects of the organizational environment.\r"

Six patients living a distance (greater than 25 miles) from the hospital who were not able to attend the sessions formed a natural comparison group. Outcome was reported by a descriptive analysis of the group experience and assessment of changes in role functioning and psychologic adaptation after the intervention. Study results supported our hypothesis that group therapy was an effective treatment modality in promoting positive adjustment of patients to the AICD device. Furthermore, trends emerged suggesting positive shifts in both role functioning and psychologic adjustment in patients attending group sessions. These findings suggest that group therapy is a useful method of providing support and education for individuals receiving the AICD device.\r"

In the past, surgical options were limited to physiologic correction at the atrial level, but long-term follow-up has revealed problems with right ventricular dysfunction, tricuspid valve insufficiency, arrhythmias, and venous obstruction. This has renewed an interest in the arterial switch as an early, definitive form of anatomic correction for infants with transposition. As selection criteria have been refined, the mortality rate at experienced centers now equals that of physiologic correction. Nursing care centers around the critically ill neonate who may have hypotension and low cardiac output because of a poorly adapted left ventricle. Assessment for potential myocardial infarction resulting from movement and reimplantation of the coronary arteries is essential.\r"

It has proved useful in many patients whose ability to maintain fluid homeostasis is compromised. Burn victims, patients with acute renal failure, patients with pulmonary edema, and trauma patients have all received benefit from CAVH. CAVH is an extracorporeal circuit in which blood is propelled by the force of the patient's blood pressure through a filter, ultrafiltered, and returned to the patient. CAVH removes fluid and solutes more slowly than hemodialysis, eliminating the danger of rapid fluid and electrolyte shifts. There are several ways to perform the procedure but all require intense and sophisticated medical and nursing care. Strong knowledge of fluid, electrolyte, and acid/base balance, hemodynamics, and assessment skills is required. The ability to intervene quickly and appropriately if trouble arises is a necessity. The dynamics of the treatment are discussed in detail in this article. How to deliver a safe and efficient treatment, troubleshooting guidelines, and suggestions for accurate documentation are also included.\r"

Rotator cuff impingement occurs towards the end of the early glenohumeral abduction. Excision arthroplasty of the acromioclavicular joint and anterior acromioplasty is highly effective for impingement under the acromion, but only moderately effective where impingement is under the acromioclavicular joint.\r"

In contrast to previous assumptions, the ultrastructure of fibroblasts both in vivo and in vitro from DC and CTS appeared identical, indicating that myofibroblasts are not specific to DC. The major differences between DC and CTS were: 1) a sixfold and fortyfold increase in fibroblast density in cord and nodular areas of DC compared with CTS; 2) a more disorganised pattern of collagen fibrils in DC; and 3) markedly narrowed microvessels surrounded by thickened, laminated basal laminae and proliferating fibroblasts in DC compared with CTS. To account for these morphological changes a hypothesis is presented which proposes that oxygen-free radicals cause pericytic necrosis and fibroblastic proliferation. This hypothesis provides a potential avenue for therapy of DC and other fibrotic conditions.\r"

We were particularly interested in the bone dynamics of the vascularised graft, since fractures occurred in 25% of the cases at an average time of eight months after surgery. Hypertrophy was more common when the limb was mechanically loaded; it was enhanced where the graft was not bypassed by internal fixation. The length of the graft and the use of additional bone graft material had no influence on the incidence of stress fracture or on hypertrophy. We conclude that a vascularised graft should be protected against fatigue fracture during the first year, and that a gradual increase in mechanical loading will enhance remodelling and hypertrophy.\r"

In most patients with less than 30 mm2 of spinal cord area, the results were poor; the cord was unable to survive. Several factors, such as chronicity of disease, age at surgery and multiplicity of involvement are said to influence the results of surgery, but the transverse area of the cord at the level of maximum compression provides the most reliable and comprehensive parameter for their prediction.\r"

The method is applicable to other spinal deformities and may help to elucidate their three-dimensional shape.\r"

He slowly developed a sternomastoid contracture and his condition was considerably improved by sternomastoid release. This combination of causes of torticollis has not, as far as we know, been previously reported. The clinician should be aware of it and should also realise that radiographs of the very immature spine may not disclose the bony anomalies.\r"

Dislocation occurred in 10% of patients by progressive migration and subluxation of the proximal femur in the presence of acetabular dysplasia. Statistical analysis identified the radiographic features that helped to predict dislocation. Measurement of acetabular index, by a method that allows for rotation of the acetabulum, was the most powerful single predictor. Measurement of this index at two and four years of age could identify patients who would dislocate unless effective treatment was undertaken, those at risk of dislocation only if scoliosis developed, and those who would not dislocate. On the basis of this method of screening for dislocation, a logical system of surgical prophylaxis is proposed.\r"

For medial migration, a new line tangential to the brim and through the horizontal mid-point of the obturator foramen was more accurate than Kohler's line, the ilio-ischial line or the iliopubic line.

Rotation within the bone was measured, using a purpose built transducer, with and without preservation of the neck, with and without cement, and with longitudinal ridges but no cement. The results show that torsional instability may be a problem in uncemented replacement. Preservation of the femoral neck and the use of a ridged prosthesis increases resistance to rotation. Rotational movements occurring in vivo during such activities as climbing stairs and rising from the seated position may contribute to mechanical loosening.\r"

Gloves from 280 orthopaedic operations for trauma were tested for perforations; one or more was found after 30% of the operations in gloves worn by the surgeon or scrub nurse. About 60% of the perforations were noticed at the time of penetration and most affected the dominant thumb and index finger. Puncture was more common during operations lasting more than one hour. The incidence of perforation was 19% for the outer of double gloves, 14% for a single glove and 6% for the inner of double gloves. These results indicate that surgical gloves function poorly as a protective barrier, especially in difficult, lengthy, fracture surgery. The practice of double-gloving confers increased but not absolute protection.\r"

Haemarthrosis was associated only with acute osteochondral fractures. The characteristic feature of osteochondritis dissecans was an expanding concentric lesion at the 'classical' site on the medial femoral condyle which appeared during the second decade of life and progressed to a concave steep-sided defect in the mature skeleton. Caffey's (1958) classification of epiphyseal dysplasias could not be applied to osteochondritis dissecans, which appeared to have a gradual onset without acute trauma. Much of the controversy about the cause of osteochondritis dissecans is the result of imprecise nomenclature.\r"

Twenty-one patients had unstable knees at follow-up; the mean total anteroposterior laxity for these patients was 12.6 +/- 3.9 mm compared with 7.1 +/- 4.3 mm for the normal knee. Most patients had few symptoms, but there was a significant reduction in the mean level of activity in the unstable group.\r"

To investigate the effects of diltiazem on parathyroid function in vivo, 15 subjects were treated with diltiazem (120-360 mg/day), and 15 subjects were treated with the nonspecific vasodilator hydralazine (75-150 mg/day). Diltiazem lowered serum PTH levels from 1.07 +/- 0.07 to 0.87 +/- 0.07 pg/L (P = 0.001), and increased urinary calcium and decreased urinary phosphate excretion (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01, respectively). The hydralazine-treated subjects had no significant differences in any of these parameters. To investigate this effect further, dispersed bovine parathyroid cells were incubated for 2 h with or without diltiazem. Regression analysis of PTH released vs. the concentration of diltiazem (10(-7)-10(-4) mol/L) revealed a significant negative relationship (P less than 0.01) with 40% inhibition of PTH release at 10(-4) mol/L (P less than 0.01). The cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, measured using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2, was significantly increased in the presence of 10(-4) mol/L diltiazem (P less than 0.01). In summary, diltiazem lowered PTH levels in vivo and in vitro, perhaps acting as a Ca2+ channel agonist in the parathyroid cell and inhibiting PTH release through a rise in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration.\r"

Serum concentration profiles were analyzed for integrated cortisol release (area under the curve), pulsatile hormone release by an objective, statistically based pulse detection algorithm (cluster analysis), and periodic hormone release (circadian and ultradian rhythms) by Fourier expansion time series analysis. Urinary cortisol excretion per 24 h was measured in 5 men. The mean 24-h integrated serum cortisol concentration increased 1.7-fold during fasting (P = 0.0006). This increase resulted from a 2-fold increase in the serum cortisol concentrations between pulses (valley mean; P = 0.0004), an increase in the pulse height (P = 0.001), and an increase in pulse increment above baseline (P = 0.01). There were no changes in the number of pulses per 24 h, the interval between pulses, the width of the pulses, or the area of the pulses during fasting. Twenty-four-hour urinary cortisol excretion increased in all men, and the mean urinary cortisol (nanomoles per L)/creatinine clearance (milliliters per s) ratio increased from 119 on day 0 to 187 on day 5 (n = 5; P = 0.05). The pattern of periodic hormone release also changed during fasting; the mean (+/- SE) circadian rhythm (24-h) amplitude decreased from 160 +/- 14 nmol/L on day 0 to 102 +/- 105 nmol/L on day 5 (P = 0.06), and the amplitude of the 12-h rhythm increased from 68 +/- 11 to 99 +/- 11 nmol/L. There also were significant increases in the amplitudes of rhythms with periodicities of 8.1, 4.1, 2.4, 1.6, and 1.3 h (P = 0.02-0.008). Fasting in normal men results in distinct changes in the amount and pattern of pulsatile, circadian, and ultradian cortisol release.\r"

The 150K PRL species persisted as the predominant circulating form of PRL throughout each trimester of pregnancy in these women. In contrast, the predominant form of PRL in serum from normal pregnant women was the 22K PRL form. Gel filtration analysis of the umbilical venous cord serum of infants of the macroprolactinemic women demonstrated excessive concentrations of 150K and 50K PRL compared to the molecular species of PRL in the cord serum of normal infants. Repeat analysis of the PRL species in one infant at age 3 yr continued to reveal excessive secretion of 150K PRL (11% vs. less than 6% in normals). These data suggest that genetic influences may be operative in determining PRL heterogeneity.\r"

Octreotide was administered sc, and its pressor effect was assessed while the patients were semirecumbent and on the tilt table. We also studied the effect of octreotide on blood pressure while patients walked. The efficacy of therapy was assessed by measuring the duration of walking (walking time) before the onset of hypotension. Low doses of octreotide (0.2-0.4 micrograms/kg) had a pressor effect in all patients with progressive autonomic failure (n = 7), multiple system atrophy (n = 7), and diabetic autonomic neuropathy (n = 8), but not in patients with sympathotonic orthostatic hypotension (n = 6). Larger doses (0.4-1.6 micrograms/kg) resulted in a sustained (greater than or equal to 50 min) increase in blood pressure during walking in four of six patients with progressive autonomic failure and in one of six patients with multiple system atrophy. Some patients in whom octreotide failed to stabilize upright blood pressure had a satisfactory response to the drug after pretreatment with dihydroergotamine (10 micrograms/kg, sc). Patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy, although sensitive to the pressor effect of octreotide, often developed nausea or abdominal cramps after moderate doses (greater than 1.0 micrograms/kg). These results indicate that the pressor effect of octreotide is sufficiently potent to prevent orthostatic hypotension in some patients with autonomic neuropathy. Others require treatment with both dihydroergotamine and octreotide to achieve a stable upright blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies carried out by screening a lambda gt11 human thyroid cDNA library with serum samples from selected patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and a polyclonal antibody to porcine thyroid peroxidase (TPO) confirmed, at the molecular level, that TPO is a major component of the thyroid microsomal antigen (M). That investigation led to the isolation of a clone (C2) which encodes an 85-amino acid segment of TPO and harbors a major epitope recognized by serum from several patients with autoimmune thyroid disease that contained anti-M autoantibodies (MAb). In this study, C2 antigen that was produced as a beta-galactosidase fusion protein was used to establish an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay for the detection of anti-C2 autoantibodies (C2Ab). C2Ab then were assayed in 191 patients with different autoimmune and nonautoimmune thyroid disorders, and 50 patients with nonthyroidal autoimmune diseases. The results were compared with the titers of anti-TPO antibodies (TPOAb; as detected by monoclonal antibody-assisted RIA) and MAb (as detected by passive hemagglutination). Positive C2Ab was found in the serum of 85 of 136 (63%) patients whose serum contained TPOAb and/or MAb. A significant positive correlation was found between the levels of C2Ab and those of TPOAb (r = 0.76; P less than 0.001) or MAb (r = 0.69; P less than 0.001), which was independent of the type of underlying autoimmune thyroid disorder. Low levels of C2Ab also were found in 10 of 105 (9%) serum samples that did not contain TPOAb. Western blot analysis carried out on the latter samples showed that in 2 samples the apparent C2Ab reactivity was due to the presence of antibodies reacting with beta-galactosidase. In conclusion, we confirmed the validity of screening lambda gt11 cDNA human thyroid libraries to better characterize thyroid autoantigens and demonstrated the feasibility of using recombinant proteins to establish diagnostic assays for autoantibodies.\r"

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of TGHA and MCHA during and after treatment of hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease. One hundred and seventeen such patients were treated for 2 yr with methimazole and then followed for an additional year or more (mean, 30 months). The patients were classified into the following three groups: group I, patients negative for TGHA and MCHA before and during the 2 yr of treatment; group II, patients positive for MCHA but negative for TGHA before and during the 2 yr of treatment; and group III, patients who were positive for both TGHA and MCHA before and during treatment. The relapse rates after discontinuation of treatment in these groups were 39% (13 of 33), 27% (13 of 48), and 11% (4 of 36), respectively; the value in group I was significantly higher than that in group III (P less than 0.01). The results suggest that the presence of TGHA and MCHA may influence the prognosis of Graves' disease in patients treated with methimazole. Those patients who had neither antibody before and during treatment were most likely to have a relapse of hyperthyroidism, and those who had both antibodies were least likely to have a relapse.\r"

  ".W": "cDNAs for thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) have been cloned and sequenced. Using such cDNAs, we investigated the regulation of TPO and Tg gene expression by various agents in cultured human thyroid cells. Unstimulated human thyroid cells contained a major RNA species [3.2 kilobases (kb) in length] and several minor RNA species (less than 3.2 kb mRNA) of TPO, but no detectable Tg transcripts. However, TSH-stimulated thyroid cells contained four distinct TPO mRNA species (4.0, 3.2, 2.1, and 1.7 kb) and a single Tg mRNA species (8.5 kb). TSH stimulated the TPO and Tg mRNA levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The same results were obtained with 8-bromo-cAMP, a cAMP analog, but not with insulin or insulin-like growth factor I. Furthermore, inductions of these mRNAs by TSH and 8-bromo-cAMP were almost completely blocked by cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. These results suggest that human thyroid cells contain four distinct TPO mRNAs and a single species of Tg mRNA, and the levels of all mRNAs are increased by TSH/cAMP stimulation. These increases are blocked by inhibiting protein synthesis, indicating that TSH stimulation of TPO and Tg mRNA levels may be mediated by newly synthesized protein(s).\r"

After 2 days, during which the monkeys were fed ad libitum, their food was withdrawn at 1500 h for 48 h while allowing free access to water. The food then was returned, and the animals were studied for a further 2 days. The mean maternal whole blood glucose concentration significantly decreased, and plasma cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) concentrations significantly increased within 30 h of food withdrawal (P less than 0.05). The maternal plasma estradiol concentration increased significantly at 1000 h on the second day of food withdrawal (P less than 0.05), whereas the plasma progesterone concentration did not change. The maternal blood glucose and plasma cortisol, DHEAS and estradiol concentrations returned to baseline by the second day of food replacement. We conclude that the stress of hypoglycemia and/or the attendant inability to eat, together or separately, stimulate maternal adrenal glucocorticoid and androgen secretion during the period of food withdrawal. The increased maternal DHEAS and perhaps other adrenal androgen concentrations result in increased maternal estrogen production.\r"

  ".W": "TSH binding inhibitor immunoglobulin (TBII) and thyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb) activities were measured serially for 4-32 months in nine patients before and during development of hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease. Initially, all were euthyroid, seven had thyroid enlargement, one had proptosis, and seven had high serum titers of antithyroid microsomal antibodies. The occurrence of hyperthyroidism was preceded by detection of both TBII and TSAb in four patients and detection of TSAb alone in four patients. One patient had neither TBII nor TSAb when euthyroid. The mean initial TBII and TSAb activities were 10.2 +/- 15.2% (+/- SD) and 2677 +/- 4620%, respectively, when these patients were euthyroid. When they became hyperthyroid, both TBII and TSAb activities increased in all patients. At that time, TBII was detected in all but one (eight of nine subjects; 88.9%), with a mean activity of 58.8 +/- 23.4% (+/- SD), and TSAb was detected in all nine patients, with a mean value of 4508 +/- 4429%. These findings not only indicate the crucial role of TSH receptor antibodies in the development of hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease, but also suggest that a certain period of subclinical Graves' disease exists before the onset of overt hyperthyroidism in most patients, in the sense that they have TSH receptor antibodies, especially TSAb, in their serum even though they are euthyroid.\r"

  ".W": "Both the androgen-induced decline in serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels during puberty and the anabolic effect of exogenous testosterone are absent in patients with androgen insensitivity (testicular feminization). To determine whether the androgen-induced decline in serum SHBG could be used as a test of androgen sensitivity, we studied the effect of the anabolic-androgenic steroid stanozolol (17 beta-hydroxy-17 alpha-methyl-5 alpha-androstano-[3,2-c]pyrazol) on serum SHBG in 25 control subjects, 3 patients with complete androgen insensitivity, and 4 patients with partial androgen insensitivity. Stanozolol was administered orally for 3 days (0.2 mg/kg.day); blood samples were taken before and 5, 6, 7, and 8 days after the beginning of the test for measurements of serum SHBG. The lowest value (i.e. the peak response) in each subject was used as the measure of the response to stanozolol. In the control subjects the mean nadir serum SHBG level was 51.6 +/- 5.9% (+/- SD) of the initial value (P less than 0.001). In the 4 patients with partial androgen insensitivity the nadir serum SHBG ranged from 73-89%, and in the 3 patients with complete androgen insensitivity it ranged from 93-97% of the initial value. Thus, the decrease in serum SHBG after short term administration of stanozolol reflects androgen responsiveness and, thus, may be used to differentiate patients with androgen insensitivity syndromes from those with other causes of male pseudohermaphroditism.\r"

  ".W": "A 40-year-old woman, who had previously received radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism, presumably due to Graves' disease, subsequently was found to have inappropriately elevated serum TSH and alpha-subunit levels and a pituitary adenoma. Detailed clinical studies revealed marked serum TSH elevations (approximately 100 mU/L) with no circadian variation, but with 7 pulses/24 h. Serum alpha-subunit levels averaged 2.5 micrograms/L, with 13 pulses/24 h. Neither serum TSH nor alpha-subunit responded to TRH stimulation, nor did serum TSH change during dopamine infusion, but alpha-subunit levels did decline slightly. In contrast, during somatostatin infusion, serum TSH declined to 30% of baseline levels, while alpha-subunit levels did not change. Pituitary adenoma tissue obtained at the time of transsphenoidal surgery immunostained weakly with anti-TSH beta serum and strongly with anti-alpha-subunit serum. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from the tumor revealed TSH beta and alpha-subunit mRNA levels of normal length, while primer extension analysis showed a major initiation site for the TSH beta gene that appeared to be identical in the tumor and normal pituitary tissue. A second minor upstream start site was detected in the tumor, but it represented less than 1% of transcription compared to the major downstream start site. We conclude that the tumor secreted TSH and alpha-subunit in an abnormal and discordant fashion, but that the TSH gene initiation site appeared to be normal and, therefore, did not explain the observed secretory abnormalities.\r"

There is no agreement concerning serum PTH levels in such patients. In this study, we measured serum PTH concentrations using a newly developed sensitive 2-site immunoradiometric assay in 17 hyperthyroid patients before and after radioiodine therapy. The mean serum PTH and calcium concentrations were 28 +/- 15 (+/- SD) ng/L (normal range, 12-65 ng/L) and 2.4 +/- 0.5 mmol/L (normal range, 2.1-2.6 mmol/L) before therapy. After therapy serum PTH concentrations increased in 16 of the 17 patients. The increase in serum PTH was greater in the 9 patients who became hypothyroid rapidly (29 +/- 15 to 75 +/- 29 ng/L) compared with that in the 8 patients who became euthyroid gradually (26 +/- 16 to 45 +/- 24 ng/L). Serum PTH rose along with TSH as the patients became hypothyroid after radioiodine, and both serum PTH and TSH fell when L-T4 therapy was given. The reciprocal changes in serum PTH concentrations and thyroid function over time suggest a strong association of bone mineral metabolism and thyroid status.\r"

  ".W": "The response of two patients with autoantibody-mediated C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency to replacement therapy with C1-INH was studied over a period of 3 d. In patient 1 an acute attack of angioedema was successfully managed by infusion of 1,000 U of C1-INH concentrate. C1-INH function returned to normal levels within 30 min, while CH50 and C4 peaked after 6-7 h and C1 hemolytic activity reached 50-60% of normal after 3 d. Immediately after the injection an increase in C1-INH-anti-C1-INH complexes was observed. Based on NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the patients' Mr 96,000 C1-INH, it is concluded that this fragment is generated after cleavage of C1-INH in its active site by one of its target proteases without generating a covalent C1-INH-enzyme complex. In a second patient with a four to five times higher anti-C1-INH antibody titer, the infusion of 500 ml of plasma or of 2,000 U of C1-INH concentrate influenced neither the severity of the patient's angioedema nor the tested parameters, except for an increase in the amount of C1-INH-anti-C1-INH complexes. Analysis of patients' anti-C1-INH antibodies revealed that the antibodies recognize different epitopes within the C1-INH. This suggests that patients with acquired angioedema type II are a heterogenous group with respect to the C1-INH autoantibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Oxygen-derived free radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction during ischemia, postischemic myocardial \"stunning,\" and reperfusion injury. We investigated the effects of oxygen-derived free radicals on cardiac function in intact isolated rabbit hearts and single guinea pig ventricular myocytes. In the intact rabbit ventricle, exposure to free radical-generating systems caused increased cellular K+ efflux, shortening of the action potential duration, changes in tension, and depletion of high energy phosphates similar to ischemia and metabolic inhibition. In patch-clamped single ventricular myocytes, free radical-generating systems activated ATP-sensitive K+ channels, decreased the calcium current, and caused cell shortening by irreversibly inhibiting glycolytic and oxidative metabolism. The results suggest that free radicals generated during ischemia and reperfusion may contribute to electrophysiologic abnormalities and contractile dysfunction by inhibiting glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Inhibition of metabolism by free radicals may be an important factor limiting functional recovery from an ischemic insult after reestablishment of effective blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the immune system in controlling intestinal electrolyte transport was studied in rat and rabbit colon in Ussing chambers. A phagocyte stimulus, the chemotactic peptide FMLP, and a mast cell stimulus, sheep anti-rat IgE, caused a brief (less than 10 min) increase in short-circuit current (Isc). Products of immune system activation, platelet-activating factor (PAF) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), caused a sustained, biphasic increase in the Isc. Ion replacement and flux studies indicated that these agonists stimulated electrogenic Cl secretion and inhibited neutral NaCl absorption; responses that were variably inhibited by the cyclooxygenase blockers indomethacin and piroxicam. Lesser degrees of inhibition by nordihydroguaiaretic acid could be accounted for by decreased prostaglandin synthesis rather than by lipoxygenase blockade. Tetrodotoxin, hexamethonium, and atropine also inhibited immune agonist-stimulated Isc, but had no effect on immune agonist-stimulated production of PGE2 or PGI2. These results indicate that immune system agonists alter intestinal epithelial electrolyte transport through release of cyclooxygenase products from cells in the lamina propria with at least 50% of the response being due to cyclooxygenase product activation of the enteric nervous system. The immune system, like the enteric nervous system and the endocrine system, may be a major regulating system for intestinal water and electrolyte transport in health and disease.\r"

Anti-TDT antibodies were detected in serum by ELISA and reached stable levels 4-5 wk after the first immunization. Spleens from immunized mice were fused with NS-1 mouse myeloma cells and approximately 9,329 resultant hybrids were screened by ELISA for reactivity to TDT. Two stable hybrids were isolated, subcloned, and characterized. These hybrids, termed TD13a1 and TD2C5, secreted specific anti-TDT antibodies that recognized TDT but not the related sodium channel blocker, saxitoxin (STX), as determined by competition ELISA. Both antibodies were of the IgG1k subclass with Ka's approaching 10(7) M-1. The inhibitory ability of these antibodies was tested by a competitive displacement assay for [3H]STX on rat brain membranes. Both antibodies strongly inhibited TDT binding to membranes. A nanomole of TD2C5 was able to bind approximately 1.8 nmol of TDT, whereas a comparable amount of TD13a1 bound half as much. Furthermore, TD2C5 was able to protect against TDT-induced reduction of peripheral nerve action potentials in rat tibial nerve when administered in situ. These antibodies thus represent potentially useful reagents for neurobiologic research, detection of toxin contamination and diagnosis of poisoning, and may provide protection against the toxicity of TDT in vivo.\r"

Using two different antibodies (directed against GAWK [1-17] and [20-38] fragments) GAWK-LI was measured in tumors from 194 patients and in the plasma of 434 patients by RIA. The highest tissue concentrations of GAWK-LI were found in pheochromocytoma (GAWK [1-17]-LI, 18,173 +/- 3,915; GAWK [20-38]-LI, 17,852 +/- 2,763 [mean +/- SEM] pmol/g wet wt tissue; n = 9), which were at least ten times higher than any other tumors producing GAWK-LI. High concentrations of GAWK-LI were also found in other types of endocrine tumors including carcinoid, medullary carcinoma of thyroid, pancreatic, and ACTH-producing lung tumors. On the other hand, low concentrations of GAWK-LI were found in nonendocrine tumors. Plasma concentrations of GAWK-LI were found to be elevated in patients with endocrine tumor, but more so in those with pancreatic tumors than with pheochromocytomas. Plasma concentrations returned to normal after successful tumor removal. Chromatographic profiles of GAWK-LI in extracts of pheochromocytomas and normal adrenals showed high molecular weight peaks that were absent in the extracts of other endocrine tumors and normal pancreas, suggesting differential tissue-specific processing. Thus GAWK-LI is produced by a variety of endocrine tumors and may serve as a plasma tumor marker, especially in patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of chronic intrauterine pulmonary hypertension on the perinatal pulmonary circulation, we induced chronic elevations of pulmonary artery pressure in 24 late-gestation fetal lambs by maintaining partial compression of the ductus arteriosus with an inflatable vascular occluder. Pulmonary artery pressure was increased from 44 +/- 1 to 62 +/- 3 mmHg for 3-14 d. Although left pulmonary artery blood flow initially increased during acute partial ductus compression, the increase in flow was not sustained during chronic ductus compression despite persistent elevations of pulmonary artery pressure (P less than 0.01). Chronic hypertension decreased the slope of the pressure-flow relationship from 3.4 +/- 0.3 (initial) to 0.9 +/- 0.1 ml/min per mmHg, and blunted the fetal pulmonary vascular response to small increases in PO2 (P less than 0.0001). Pulmonary hypertension for greater than 8 d increased the wall thickness of small pulmonary arteries (P less than 0.001). Compared with controls, hypertensive animals had higher pulmonary artery pressure, lower pulmonary blood flow, and predominant right-to-left ductus shunting after cesarean-section delivery (P less than 0.0001). We conclude that chronic pulmonary hypertension in utero, in the absence of hypoxemia or sustained increases in blood flow, causes abnormal fetal pulmonary vasoreactivity, structural remodeling, and the failure to achieve the normal decline in pulmonary resistance at birth.\r"

Apical and basolateral membrane H permeabilities were 0.52 +/- 0.07 and 0.67 +/- 0.18 cm/s, respectively. Using these permeabilities we calculate that proton backleak from the luminal fluid to cell does not contribute significantly to net proton secretion in the early proximal tubule, but may contribute in the late proximal tubule. Apical and basolateral membrane formic acid permeabilities measured at extracellular pH 6.62 were 4.6 +/- 0.5 X 10(-2) and 6.8 +/- 1.5 X 10(-2) cm/s, respectively. Control studies demonstrated that the formic acid permeabilities were not underestimated by either the simultaneous movement of formate into the cell or the efflux of formic acid across the opposite membrane. The measured apical membrane formic acid permeability is too small to support all of transcellular NaCl absorption in the rat by a mechanism that involves Na/H-Cl/formate transporters operating in parallel with formic acid nonionic diffusion.\r"
