  ".W": "Eleven southeastern medical schools cooperated to evaluate nutrition knowledge and attitudes of medical students. This study complements previous reports of an examination of entering freshmen and seniors. Average knowledge scores for 165 students tested after basic sciences (preclinical) training in this study were 67 +/- 7% compared with 53 +/- 6% for freshmen and 69 +/- 8% for seniors. The upperclassmen's scores were higher than the freshmen's (p less than 0.001) and varied with the amount of required nutrition teaching. Only 13% of preclinical students perceived nutrition as important to their careers compared with 74% of entering and 59% of graduating students, suggesting that preclinical teaching reduces their sense of relevance of nutrition to medicine. These findings suggest that nutrition knowledge can be increased through preclinical coursework and that the knowledge level can be maintained through the clinical years. However, the positive attitude of freshmen toward nutrition is lost after preclinical training and is only partially regained after the clinical years.\r"

Clearly, routine elution studies were nonproductive. However, there was no evaluation method for exclusion from elution studies. Therefore, an algorithm correlating laboratory, transfusion, and clinical data was developed. It identified delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and possible autoimmune hemolytic anemia. By following the algorithm, technologists would perform elution studies, forego them, or consult the Medical Director. To test the algorithm, 568 positive DATs identified from 12,416 specimens were analyzed. Technologist evaluation without medical consultation for 194 specimens yielded 106 elution studies; 374 specimens required medical consultation, and 166 had eluates. Seven delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions were found. This suggests certain elution studies can be eliminated routinely. However, DATs with positive results associated with possible delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions require investigation. The search for autoimmune hemolytic anemia was not productive.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: HLA-B27, an immunogenetic marker that is present in 8 percent of the white population around the world, has been found to be an important risk factor for the development of a group of rheumatic disorders, the seronegative spondyloarthropathies. Our objective was to assess the possible role of HLA-B27 and the associated inflammatory disease process in the development of lone aortic regurgitation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A group of 91 patients with lone aortic regurgitation were studied by HLA typing and clinical and roentgenologic examination. RESULTS: The HLA-B27-associated inflammatory disease process was found to be the probable underlying cause in 15 to 20 percent of patients with lone aortic regurgitation of different degrees of severity. Furthermore, HLA-B27 was found in 88 percent of the male patients with the combination of aortic regurgitation and severe conduction system abnormalities. CONCLUSION: We suggest that this cardiac syndrome should be regarded as an HLA-B27-associated syndrome, sometimes part of ankylosing spondylitis or Reiter's disease, but just as often presenting without obvious rheumatic disease. The marker is thus an important and widely distributed risk factor not only for the development of rheumatic disease but also for acquired aortic regurgitation and sever conduction system abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The prevalence and characteristics of the rheumatic and extra-rheumatic manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were determined in a prospective manner. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred one patients with HIV infection were consecutively interviewed and examined. The prevalence of autoantibodies and their association with rheumatologic symptoms were also determined. RESULTS: The musculoskeletal system was involved in 72 patients. Thirty-five patients had arthralgias, 10 had Reiter's syndrome, two had psoriatic arthritis, two had myositis, and one had vasculitis. Also found were two previously unreported syndromes. The first, occurring in 10 patients, consisted of severe intermittent pain involving less than four joints, without evidence of synovitis, of short duration (two to 24 hours), and requiring therapy (ranging from nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to narcotics). The second, occurring in 12 patients, consisted of arthritis (oligoarticular in six patients, monoarticular in three patients, and polyarticular in three patients) involving the lower extremities and lasting from one week to six months. The synovial fluid of five patients (three with arthritis, one with Reiter's syndrome, and one with psoriatic arthritis) was sterile and inflammatory. CONCLUSION: Musculoskeletal complications are common in advanced stages of HIV infection. Persons in a high-risk group for HIV infection who manifest oligoarthritis with or without any other extra-articular manifestation suggestive of Reiter's syndrome or other form of spondyloarthropathy should be tested for HIV.\r"

Total lymphocyte and T-cell levels declined to similar degrees following injury or sepsis and did not appear to be of value as prognostic indicators. However, analysis of T-cell subsets in septic patients indicated that survivors exhibited normal T-cell subpopulations as well as helper to suppressor cell ratios. Nonsurvivors generally exhibited a selective depression of helper (OKT4) T-cells and the resultant degree of helper to suppressor ratio decline was directly related to mortality. A helper to suppressor ratio (OKT4/T8) below 0.6 was uniformly associated with a fatal outcome. Finally, a small subgroup of septic nonsurviving patients exhibited a selective depression of suppressor (OKT8) lymphocytes which also appeared to carry an unfavorable prognosis. These data indicate that T-lymphocyte subpopulation analysis is a useful predictor of hospital course.\r"

All patients were successfully treated with intravenous acyclovir. Herpetic tracheobronchitis may be a commoner clinical syndrome than generally assumed. In an elderly patient with unresolving acute bronchospasm, herpesvirus infection of the lower respiratory tract should be considered in the differential diagnosis. In the immunocompetent host, antiviral therapy can successfully treat herpesvirus respiratory infection, with reversal of clinical, virologic, and pathologic findings. A prompt and accurate diagnosis is crucial.\r"

Single-photon emission tomography showed that marked hypoperfusion was not limited to the right posterior capsular region, but also involved the overlying parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent the frontal cortex. At autopsy in 1 patient, the infarct was nearly limited to the deep white matter of the temporal isthmus and the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule; only minute lesions were present in the globus pallidus, body of caudate, and amygdala. These findings are consistent with a disconnection phenomenon as the basis for subcortical neglect with ipsilateral deactivation of the parietofrontal cortex.\r"

We examined a possible pathogenetic role of toxic oxygen species elaborated by macrophages in EAN by administering oxygen radical scavengers. Early treatment of rats with either catalase or superoxide dismutase (10,000 U/kg/day) protected animals from the development of EAN. Treatment delayed until there was clinical manifestation of EAN (day 13) still markedly attenuated the severity of the disease, as evidenced by clinical assessment, electrophysiological studies, and morphological observation. In cell culture, macrophages from sham-treated controls generated heightened oxidative metabolic responses indicating in vivo macrophage activation. Addition of catalase or superoxide dismutase abrogated or diminished chemiluminescence and production of reactive oxygen intermediates by macrophages ex vivo. Our findings underscore the importance of macrophages in EAN and provide evidence that, in this model, macrophage-derived reactive oxygen intermediates contribute to damage of the myelin sheath.\r"

Clinical syndromes observed in the 11 (52%) symptomatic patients included distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN) and chronic inflammatory demyelinative polyneuropathy (CIDP). Specimens from 19 of 20 patients (95%), both symptomatic and asymptomatic, had histopathological evidence of moderate or severe demyelination (79%), axonal degeneration (36%), and mononuclear cell inflammation (37%). Nerves from patients with CIDP and DSPN showed similar degrees of demyelination and axonal degeneration, but inflammation was more intense in CIDP. Immunohistochemical staining identified the majority of inflammatory cells as T lymphocytes or macrophages, with a predominance of CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor cells. Diffuse immunostaining for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR was present on endothelial cells, mononuclear inflammatory cells, and Schwann cells, and variable patchy immunostaining for HLA-DR was present on nerve fibers. Control nerve specimens showed staining for HLA-DR limited to endothelial, and a few mononuclear cells. The patterns of immunostaining were similar for AIDS and ARC patients. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was cultured from peripheral nerve in 3 patients, but HIV antigen was not detected by immunohistochemical staining of 8 specimens. The findings implicate HIV infection in nerve, with T cell- and macrophage-mediated tissue destruction as the pathogenetic mechanism of the AIDS/ARC neuropathy.\r"

The frequency of HLA-A and HLA-B antigen loci and the median values of peripheral blood T lymphocytes were similar to the control population. However, seven patients with moderate or severe clinical disease had a marked reduction in T lymphocytes and these patients had an increased frequency of the HLA antigens, A1 and B8. These results suggest that T lymphocytes may play a role in the pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa and that HLA-A1 and HLA-B8 may predispose the patient to more severe disease, but further research is necessary to clarify this.\r"

  ".W": "Complement activation was examined prospectively in 100 cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) patients. Plasma C3a desArg (C3a) increased (cannulation: 234 +/- 33 ng/mL; 20 minutes on CPB: 622 +/- 51; 2 hours after CPB: 1143 +/- 109, p less than 0.0001). C3a at 2 hours was higher in the 13 patients requiring mechanical ventilation for longer than 1 day (1023 +/- 274) than in the 67 without respiratory complication (568 +/- 45, p less than 0.004). Five more patients were studied for neutrophil activation to confirm that a biologic effect of complement activation occurs during CPB; in these five patients C3a increased to 317% of baseline after 10 minutes on CPB with a corresponding rise in neutrophil cell surface receptors for the complement opsonin C3b (as measured by indirect immunofluorescence) to 168% (p less than 0.05). Both increases were sustained at 30 minutes. Temperature, dilution, and heparin were studied as variables relevant to CPB. Exposure of normal neutrophils to C5a in vitro caused an increase in C3b receptors which was dependent on temperature (0 specific fluorescence at 0 C, 30 at 25 C, 180 at 30 C, and 275 at 37 C). Generation of C3a and C5a in normal serum by zymosan was also temperature-dependent (ng/mL C5a generated: 0.7 at 25 C, 200 at 30 C, and 897 at 37 C; ng/mL C3a generated: 546 at 25 C, 10,872 at 30 C, and 65,667 at 37 C). Serum dilution to 33% decreased ng/mL C5a generated in the same system from 200 to 76 with no effect on C3a. Addition of heparin to 20 U/mL decreased ng/mL C3a generated from 10,872 to 913 and C5a from 200 to 8. Thus, hypothermia, dilution, and heparin protect CPB patients from complement activation by reducing both generation of C3a/C5a and the subsequent cellular response of neutrophil activation.\r"

There are few reports related to the use of FES in the treatment of conversion disorder paralysis of the hysterical type. This paper presents a case of hysterically paralyzed muscles where the patient received daily treatment with FES for two weeks. Electric current was applied to a weak quadriceps and to paralyzed tibialis anterior muscles. This electrotherapeutic modality was effective in improving the function of the quadriceps and in reversing the paralysis of the tibialis anterior muscles. The improvement in the muscles' functional abilities was documented through the use of quantitative measures of muscle strength as well as computerized analysis of EMG signals. The results showed that the administration of FES resulted in a dramatic increase in motor units recruitment, increased muscle strength, and improved voluntary muscle control.\r"

The autistic group showed significantly fewer large positive correlations between frontal and parietal regions, particularly those with the left inferior frontal region and its right hemispheric homologue, and significantly lower correlations of the thalamus, caudate nucleus, lenticular nucleus, and insula with frontal and parietal regions, with many correlations negative in the autistic group that were positive in the control group. These results are compatible with functionally impaired interactions between frontal/parietal regions and the neostriatum and thalamus, regions that subserve directed attention.\r"

The system determines the threshold chrominance of a colored grating in which there is no change in luminance. The study included 13 control subjects aged 10 to 57 years and 19 patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma aged 20 to 58 years. In the 13 eyes with visual field loss, color contrast sensitivity was profoundly reduced when the grating colors fell on a tritan color confusion line. In the eyes without visual field loss, tritan color contrast sensitivity was reduced to an average level considerably below the extreme limits of the control group. These results were compared with those of other color vision tests and diagnostic criteria for glaucoma. The findings suggest that among the tests used, color contrast sensitivity testing was able to discriminate most effectively between patients who had retinal damage and the normal population.\r"

The basic requirement of vestibular habituation training for positional vertigo is that vertigo should be elicited. Indeed it has been experimentally shown that the error situation itself is the very stimulus for compensation and adaptation to develop. Only maneuvers eliciting vertigo fulfill the requirement of adequate exercises. As the testing showed that the combinations of positive maneuvers were different from one patient to another, prior testing of the patient is necessary to prescribe adequate exercises.\r"

A history of STD was reported by 20 men (33%), and 34 (57%) had signs of STD including genital HPV infection, 2 (3%) had a chlamydial infection, one had molluscum contageosum, 7 (12%) had genital warts and 24 (40%) had abnormal acetowhite epithelium, indicating HPV infection. The HPV lesions were principally subclinical and located on the glans penis and the prepuce. Colposcopy and application of acetic acid are essential for detection. The gynaecologist and venereologist must recognize the sexually transmitted nature of CIN, and the causal link between CIN and HPV infection. Assessment and treatment of the male sexual partner of women treated for CIN might be an essential part in disease control with the aim of preventing cervical cancer.\r"

The ratio increased to over 1.0 (1.05-53.3) after one or two courses of chemotherapy in seven of the 12 patients. These women achieved complete remission. In the other five patients who died of the disease due to drug resistance of the tumour, the ratio after chemotherapy was low (0.04-0.74) and tended to decline.

B-CLL cells present herpes simplex virus (HSV) antigen and purified protein derivative (PPD) to HSV- and PPD-specific, interleukin-2-dependent T-cell lines in an antigen-specific manner. Treatment of B-CLL cells with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced markedly increased levels of HLA-DR expression. TPA-treated B-CLL cells showed substantially more effective presentation, especially at low antigen concentrations, than did untreated B-CLL cells. By coculturing different allogeneic combinations of B-CLL cells and T cells and by adding anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody to cultures, it was found that antigen presentation by B-CLL cells was restricted by HLA-DR in the same way as for macrophages. We concluded from these experiments that B-CLL cells have a capacity to serve as antigen-presenting cells in an HLA class II-restricted fashion and that increasing the amount of HLA class II antigen and activation of B-CLL cells resulted in effective antigen presentation.\r"

The present study provides further characterization of inhibitors from two patients with severe vWD. Inhibitors in both, like polyclonal rabbit antibody, detected all sizes of multimers and the complex structure of each multimer from platelets and plasma of normal individuals as well as from plasma of patients with IIA, IIB, and IIC vWD. Both inhibitors and the rabbit antibody reacted mainly with the intact 225-Kd vWF subunit and the 189-H and 140-Kd fragments in contrast to monoclonal antibodies specific for vWF fragments that detected a higher relative proportion of 176-Kd fragment. Furthermore, all these antibodies recognized fragment III, although one inhibitor and rabbit polyclonal antibody reacted poorly and the other inhibitor did not react at all with reduced fragment II of vWF digested with Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease. These data suggest that although human inhibitors from severe vWD patients may behave, to some extent, as polyclonal heterologous antibodies against native vWF, the former show striking differences in their target specificity as well as a much broader specificity than that described for human factor VIII inhibitors.\r"

His illness, which began with enlarged occipital and axillary nodes and weight loss, ended after 7 months with generalized lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, and bone marrow involvement. A lymph node biopsy showed a large cell lymphoma mainly sinusoidal in distribution. The blast cells with pleomorphic nuclei resembled primitive histiocytes. The cells, which expressed the T-cell-associated markers CD4 and CD5, were positive for HLA-DR, epithelial membrane antigen, and CD30 (Ki-1 antigen). The karyotype was aneuploid and included a translocation 2;5. The site of translocation on chromosome 5 (at 5q35.1) is in the region of the locus of the c-fms oncogene (receptor of the monocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor MCSF or CSF-1). The cell line Karpas 299 has the same karyotype and pattern of antigen expression as the patient's cells. Northern blot analysis of RNA showed an active rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta-chain gene. This is to our knowledge the first Ki-1 antigen-positive line to be established from a case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "The CD1 cluster of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c, identifies molecules that are differentially expressed on hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic tissues. Our earlier finding that the mantle zone (MZ) but not the germinal center (GC) of normal lymph nodes (LN) is CD1c+, CD1a-, and CD1b- prompted us to further investigate the expression of these molecules on normal, activated, and malignant B cells. We report that blood and spleen contain CD1c+ B cells that account for 49% +/- 20.4% (mean +/- SD) and 50.9% +/- 4.4% of the total B cell population, respectively. CD1a- and CD1b-specific MoAbs are unreactive with both B and T cells; these latter are CD1c- as well. When CD1c+ and CD1c- B cells are activated in vitro, the CD1c molecule is upregulated in the former subset and induced de novo in the latter. Conversely, activated blood T cells remain CD1c-. Neither CD1a nor CD1b molecules are detected on activated T and B lymphocytes. At ultrastructural level, the CD1c+ B cells exhibit distinctive features, namely, condensed chromatin with or without a nucleolus and a unique cluster of cytoplasmic vesicles and organelles; the number of nucleolated cells is higher in the spleen (95%) than in the tonsil (40%) or blood (5%). These findings further confirm the similarity between blood and MZ B cells. The CD1c expression assessed on 27 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLL) and 46 B non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHL) was detected on 41% and 32% of cases, respectively; the latter comprised four follicular and 11 diffuse histotypes. The Burkitt's lymphomas were CD1c-negative. The B-cell neoplasms were all CD1a- and, except for four with a weak cytoplasmic staining, all CD1b- as well. The clear-cut CD1c distribution in normal LN (MZ+, GC-) contrasted with the evidence that some B-NHL cells of GC origin (eg, follicular with predominantly small cleaved cells) were CD1c+. Overall, the finding that CD1c expression is restricted to a fraction of B cells present in lymphoid organs and in peripheral blood indicates that CD1c is a powerful marker for the identification and dissection of B-cell subsets whose functional properties can now be evaluated.\r"

Adenosine inhibited granulocyte aggregation in response to 10(-7) mol/L FMLP in a dose-dependent fashion; inhibition in the presence of 1 mumol/L adenosine was 25% +/- 3% (SD) and was 50% (the maximal inhibition observed) with 1 mmol/L adenosine. Quantitatively similar results were obtained when ZAP or A23187 was used as the aggregant but the response to PMA was not affected. ADA not only reversed the inhibition due to adenosine but actually augmented the aggregation to FMLP by 118% +/- 9%. Similar results were obtained with ZAP and A23187 but not with PMA. These effects of ADA depended on its enzymatic activity as they could be blocked by preincubation with DCF. Fluorescent measurement of intracellular calcium in fura-2 loaded granulocyte suspensions established that neither adenosine nor ADA affected subsequent FMLP-stimulated calcium responses. Adenosine, therefore, may inhibit granulocyte responsiveness by blocking signal transduction at a point after calcium entry/mobilization but before activation of protein kinase C. Furthermore, the augmentation of responses seen with ADA suggests that endogenous adenosine may be a physiologic autocrine regulator of granulocyte function.\r"

Except for the rare severely affected patient with a gene deletion as etiology of the disease, the molecular basis for vWD is not known. We studied the molecular basis for vWD in a breeding colony of pigs with a disease closely resembling the human disorder. The porcine vWF gene is similar in size and complexity to its human counterpart, and no gross gene deletion or rearrangement was evident as the pathogenesis of porcine vWD. A restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) within the porcine vWF gene was identified with the restriction endonuclease HindIII, and 22/35 members of the pedigree were analyzed for the polymorphic site. Linkage between the vWF locus and the vWD phenotype was established with a calculated LOD score of 5.3 (1/200,000 probability by chance alone), with no crossovers identified. These findings indicate that porcine vWD is due to a molecular defect within (or near) the vWF locus, most likely representing a point mutation or small insertion/deletion within the vWF gene.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a protein predominantly produced by activated macrophages/monocytes, is presently available in recombinant, purified form for clinical trials. Intensive studies in many laboratories have shown that besides the tumorcytotoxic effects, TNF acts on a large array of different cells and has potent immunomodulatory activities. In a clinical phase I study, some immunologic functional parameters of blood cells from patients who received 24-hour infusions of recombinant human TNF (rhTNF) were analyzed. Natural killer (NK) cell activity, TNF production, interleukin-1 (IL-1) production and mitogen-induced proliferation were measured either in whole blood samples or in cultures of peripheral mononuclear leukocytes of the patients directly before and after rhTNF infusion. NK cell activity, TNF and IL-1 production capacity and proliferative responses to concanavalin A (Con A) were significantly reduced after rhTNF application. We conclude from these observations that rhTNF in vivo acts directly or indirectly on NK cells and monocytes by either inactivating their functional capacity or by absorbing the relevant cells to the endothelial cell layer, thus removing them from circulation.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of lymphoproliferative disorders using immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes have contributed to our understanding of clonality and lineages of these disorders. In this study, we examined the rearrangement of the recently discovered T-cell delta chain genes in a variety of lymphoproliferative diseases. We show here that six of 14 T-cell lymphomas and five of 23 B-cell lymphomas or B-cell leukemia cell lines have rearranged the delta loci, while two of two hyperimmune reactions retain germline configuration within these genes. Seven of ten cases of AILD were rearranged, and Lennert's lymphoma, which has been previously described as a T-cell malignancy, also contains rearrangements in the delta chain genes (three of five). Large cell anaplastic lymphomas positive for the activation antigen CD 30 also contain rearrangement in about one-half (five of 11) of the tumors examined. Two of seven of the Hodgkin's lymphomas studied contained a rearrangement for this gene. This study indicates that this newly identified T-cell delta gene is useful in evaluating clonality but is not lineage specific. However, with only one exception (in 28 rearrangements), this gene rearranges in tumors with gamma and beta chain gene rearrangements, indicating that when used in conjunction with the other TcR genes, delta rearrangement may also be useful in evaluating lineages.\r"

Bone marrow, splenic red pulp, and thymic macrophages, which are closely associated with hematopoietic cells, were stained by the antibody, whereas hematopoietic cells, circulating cells, alveolar macrophages, Kupffer cells, peritoneal resident macrophages, and macrophages derived from granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units cultured in the presence of L-cell-conditioned medium were not stained. In addition, thymic cortical epithelial cells, the framework of reticular cells of the cortical and medullary regions of the mesenteric lymph node and periarterial lymphoid sheath of the spleen, and some vessels of the tissues examined were also stained. After phlebotomy, the fine cytoplasmic processes of Forssman-positive splenic red pulp macrophages were distributed extensively throughout the erythroid colonies. On the other hand, after hypertransfusion, these macrophages retracted their processes, became round, and tended to aggregate. These results indicate that Forssman GSL can be used as an immunohistochemical marker for stromal macrophages in the hematopoietic foci of the bone marrow and splenic red pulp.\r"

This site has been localized within 500 basepairs (bp) 5' to the XmnI intron 3 polymorphic site and increases the heterozygosity of black females at the factor IX gene locus. In addition, haplotype analysis of factor IX genes at five polymorphic loci indicates that although there is conservation of sequences between the races, factor IX genes show more heterogeneity in an American black population and thus more heterozygosity is observed in black females compared with whites. This increased heterogeneity is due to DNA polymorphisms unique to black populations and to linkage equilibrium between the most 5' and 3' polymorphic sites in factor IX genes in blacks.\r"

Twenty-four of these patients (59%) had progressive disease. Clonal chromosomal aberrations were found in 28 patients; 12 had an extra chromosome 12. Thirty patients (73%), 17 with and 13 without clonal aberrations, retained their karyotype throughout the study, although six lost minor subclones. In five patients (12%), a clonal aberration was found only once. Six patients (15%) showed changes of the karyotype. One treated patient with multiple aberrations acquired another monosomy. Another patient with multiple aberrations and prolymphocytic transformation gained a marker chromosome. One treated patient with an initially normal karyotype acquired two independent clonal aberrations. Three patients lost one subclone but retained another clone that increased in frequency. In two cases, clonal changes were associated with clinical changes. The chromosomal aberrations are mostly established already at diagnosis and mark the disease of the CLL patient. Cytogenetic analysis at any time is representative and useful in the prognosis prediction.\r"

Emptying rates after acute and chronic treatment with duodenal ulcerogens were obtained. Acute administration of cysteamine, MPTP, or mepirizole significantly delayed gastric emptying of the meal. Chronically treated rats, however, showed either no change or accelerated gastric emptying after cysteamine, MPTP, or mepirizole. Gastric emptying in chronically treated animals was faster in rats that developed the most severe duodenal ulcers. These results indicate that delayed gastric emptying instead of accelerated emptying is a more common abnormality during duodenal ulceration. After the ulcer develops, however, unaltered or accelerated gastric emptying is observed experimentally, thus suggesting that accelerated gastric emptying in duodenal ulcers is an acquired alteration. The implications that these experimental findings may have in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer, in light of the clinical data available, are discussed.\r"

The intraperitoneal administration of carbamazepine (15 and 30 mg/kg) reduced the epileptic activity for approximately 90 and 120 min, respectively, whereas that of naloxone (8 mg/kg) was ineffective. The results suggest that rCRF-induced spiking activity might be a model of temporal lobe epilepsy.\r"

Because the T-lymphocyte dependency of such a model is controversial, we further assessed the role of T-lymphocytes by determining the occurrence and magnitude of hyperglycemia as well as the pancreatic insulin contents in both STZ-injected nude C57BL/6J male mice and STZ-injected euthymic C57BL/6J male mice selectively depleted in helper and/or cytotoxic T-lymphocytes with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). The effectiveness of MoAb treatment was assessed in lymph node cells by flow-microfluorometry analysis and in spleen cells by concanavalin A stimulation, allospecific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity, and T-lymphocyte lymphokine production. Sixteen days after the first STZ injection, hyperglycemia (plasma glucose greater than 200 mg/dl) occurred in significantly fewer helper T-lymphocyte-depleted mice (P less than .005) or helper and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-depleted mice (P less than .001) than in non-MoAb-treated mice. However, a progressive increase in the number of mice with hyperglycemia ensued in all MoAb-treated groups, and 2 mo after STZ was administered, the prevalence of hyperglycemia, mean plasma glucose levels, and pancreatic insulin contents did not differ significantly from the values obtained in the non-MoAb-treated animals. Similarly, STZ-injected C57BL/6J male nude mice developed hyperglycemia that was associated with a marked decrease in pancreatic insulin contents on a time course comparable with that of STZ-injected euthymic C57BL/6J male mice depleted in helper or in helper and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes by MoAbs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Endoscopic assessment, biopsies, and gastric wash collections for acid, mucus, and deoxyribonucleic acid recovery were performed weekly; aspirin was continued until the endoscopy showed minimal damage. Six subjects took 650 mg of aspirin b.i.d., and 8 took 650 mg q.i.d.; adaptation and resolution took longer with the higher dose (median 4.5 wk vs. 1 wk, p less than 0.01). Despite improvement in mucosal appearance, gastric microbleeding remained elevated throughout aspirin administration. In contrast, deoxyribonucleic acid recovery (a marker for cellular exfoliation and regeneration) increased significantly just before the time of resolution, when, on average, it more than doubled. As no other biochemical or histologic changes could be associated with the resolution of damages, we conclude that gastric adaptation to chronic injury may involve increased cellular regeneration.\r"

The sensitivity of this technique is sufficient to detect a monoclonal population when there is as little as 1% clonal expansion in a mixed cell population. In all these groups of patients, deoxyribonucleic acid from the non-T cells demonstrated only a germ-line gene pattern, and no non-germ-line rearrangements of immunoglobulin genes as assessed by an immunoglobulin-joining heavy-chain gene probe. Deoxyribonucleic acid from the lamina propria T cells showed a rearrangement pattern of the antigen-specific T-cell receptor beta- and gamma-chain genes that is characteristic of polyclonal T cells as assessed by T-constant beta- and T-joining gamma-gene probes. These results indicate that the lamina propria non-T and T-lymphocyte populations in inflammatory bowel disease and controls are polyclonal.\r"

Endothelium-dependent relaxations were studied in the carotid and renal artery of Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Rings with and without endothelium were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. Acetylcholine and adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) caused endothelium-dependent relaxations in both arteries that were impaired in the carotid, but not in the renal artery, of the SHR, similar to those to the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside. Indomethacin did not affect relaxations to acetylcholine in the carotid artery, but it significantly augmented them in the renal artery. This finding suggests that an impaired vascular responsiveness to endothelium-derived relaxing factor is responsible for the decreased relaxations in the carotid artery of the SHR. In the renal artery, acetylcholine appears to release both endothelium-derived relaxing factor and a vasoconstrictor prostanoid. Carotid arteries of SHR were more sensitive to the constrictor effects of serotonin than were those of WKY. Endothelium removal caused a twofold to eightfold increase in sensitivity to serotonin in both strains. Thus, endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine and ADP are reduced and constrictions to serotonin are enhanced in the carotid, but not in the renal, artery of the SHR.\r"

Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) fed normal (0.75%) K or high (2.1%) K and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were examined in an endothelial function study and a histological study. In the endothelial function study, aortic rings were suspended in tissue baths to monitor isometric tension. Rings contracted with norepinephrine were tested with acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. In normal K SHRSP (blood pressure, 156 mm Hg), endothelium-dependent acetylcholine relaxation was severely depressed by 49% (p less than 0.001), whereas in high K SHRSP (blood pressure, 155 mm Hg), normal values were preserved. Endothelium-independent nitroprusside relaxation was virtually the same in both the SHRSP groups (high K vs normal K diet). Since indomethacin did not improve the impaired acetylcholine relaxation in normal K SHRSP, the cyclooxygenase products do not appear to have affected the endothelium-dependent relaxation in the normal K SHRSP. Thus, the endothelium-dependent relaxation response was much decreased in the normal K SHRSP and was preserved in the high K SHRSP. Thus, a high K diet appears to protect the aortic endothelium from a hypertension-induced dysfunction. In the histological study, aortic and mesenteric intimal lesions were assessed blindly under the microscope and graded from 0 to 60 for aortic and from 0 to 40 for mesenteric lesions. Aortic intimal lesion scores were 28 in normal K SHRSP (blood pressure, 209 mm Hg) and 13 in high K SHRSP (blood pressure, 207 mm Hg; -54%; p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At 1, 6, 12, and 18 mo of age, male Fischer F344 rats were subjected daily to swimming exercise for 6 mo. At the end of the 6-mo training period, spleen lymphocytes were isolated from the exercised rats and from age-matched sedentary controls. The induction of lymphocyte proliferation was measured with the mitogens concanavalin A (ConA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In addition, the ability of the lymphocytes to produce interleukin 2 (IL 2) in response to ConA induction was measured. ConA- and LPS-induced proliferation decreased 41-63% between 7 and 25 mo of age in both exercised and sedentary control rats. ConA-induced IL 2 production decreased 42 and 62% between 7 and 25 mo of age for exercised and sedentary control rats, respectively. Although the age-related decline in mitogen-induced proliferation and IL 2 production was smaller in exercised rats, this was due to a lower level of mitogenesis and IL 2 production in lymphocytes from young exercised rats. Exercise resulted in a significant decrease (23-32%) in mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation and IL-2 production in 7-mo-old exercised rats compared with 7-mo-old sedentary rats. However, in the 18- and 24-mo-old rats, mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation and IL 2 production was not significantly different between exercised and sedentary control rats.\r"

Serum BGP concentrations changed in relation to age and sex with a pattern that resembles the height velocity curves for children. The increase in serum BGP occurred at the expected age of the growth spurt in both sexes, and the peak values occurred at the age of 12 yr in girls [mean, 49.2 +/- 5.6 (+/- SE) micrograms/L] and 14 yr in boys (64.0 +/- 6.3 micrograms/L). In the boys aged 10-14 yr and in the girls aged 9-12 yr, serum BGP correlated significantly with serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), serum testosterone, age and height. When the interrelationship was analyzed by means of partial correlation, with age held constant, serum BGP still correlated significantly with the other parameters, but when height was fixed there was only a correlation with serum IGF-I. In children with untreated central precocious puberty, the mean serum BGP concentration was significantly higher than in age-matched normal children [mean, 61.4 +/- 31.7 (+/- SD) vs. 29.0 +/- 10.3 micrograms/L; P less than 0.001]. Serum BGP values decreased significantly in these patients during 1 yr of treatment with a LHRH analog (buserelin) and cyproterone acetate. We conclude that serum BGP is a sensitive marker of bone growth in normal children and in children with increased growth velocity. Repeated measurements may provide useful information in the diagnosis and treatment of children with disturbances in bone turnover.\r"

  ".W": "Specific receptors for CRH were identified in five freshly excised pituitary adenomas causing Cushing's disease. Their kinetic properties and mean affinity constant [1.45 +/- 0.38 (+/- SE) nmol/L] were comparable to the characteristics of rat and monkey anterior pituitary CRH receptors. No correlation was found between the immediate preoperative plasma and urinary cortisol levels and the number of pituitary adenoma CRH receptors, which ranged from 6-96 fmol/mg protein, unlike in rats, in which corticosterone modulates the number of anterior pituitary CRH receptors. The lack of correlation between the concentration of CRH receptors and plasma cortisol levels may reflect the inability of glucocorticoids to down-regulate CRH receptors in these tumors. Thus, corticotroph adenomas are resistant not only to the feedback actions of glucocorticoids on proopiomelanocortin synthesis and secretion but also to their actions on CRH receptors.\r"

AMA titers and thyroid function tests were measured sequentially in 261 mothers from delivery to up to 1 yr postpartum. To test for the association of HLA haplotypes in the subgroup of women with postpartum painless thyroiditis with hyperthyroidism, typing for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, and -DQ antigens was carried out in a selected group of 38 mothers with this syndrome. Their results were compared to those in 60 women with hypothyroid goitrous autoimmune thyroiditis and 98 regional controls. In the AMA study, 40 (15%) of the 261 mothers had positive AMA titers (titer, less than or equal to 1:80) at delivery, 54 (21%) 2-4 months postpartum, 69 (26%) 5-7 months postpartum, and 60 (23%) 1 yr postpartum. Among 55 mothers who developed postpartum thyroid dysfunction, 25 (47%) had positive AMA at delivery [relative risk (RR), 10.0; P less than 0.001; sensitivity, 45%; specificity, 95%]. Two to 4 months postpartum, 46 mothers had thyroid dysfunction, of whom 35 (76%) had positive AMA, while only 19 of the 215 euthyroid mothers (9%) had positive tests for AMA. Positive AMA tests at these times resulted in a RR for postpartum thyroid dysfunction of 32.8 (P less than 0.0001; sensitivity, 76%; specificity, 91%). Five to 7 months postpartum, 55 mothers had thyroid dysfunction, of whom 47 (86%) had positive AMA, while only 22 of 206 euthyroid mothers (11%) were positive (RR, 59.0; P less than 0.0001; sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 90%). In the HLA studies, DR5 occurred in 11 of 38 (29%) women with postpartum painless thyroiditis with hyperthyroidism vs. 12 of 98 (12%) controls, resulting in a RR of 2.9 (P less than 0.05). HLA-DR5 was present in 22 of 60 (37%) patients with goitrous autoimmune thyroiditis (RR, 4.2; P less than 0.01). HLA-DR4 and HLA-DQw3 were slightly but not significantly increased in women with postpartum painless thyroiditis with hyperthyroidism and goitrous autoimmune thyroiditis compared to those in normal controls. DQw1 was reciprocally decreased (P less than 0.025) in the women with goitrous autoimmune thyroiditis, but not in the women with postpartum painless thyroiditis with hyperthyroidism compared to that in normal controls...\r"

Both normal and leukopenic animals had increased BBBP 18 h after inoculation, with normal rats demonstrating significantly increased BBBP after challenge with the encapsulated strain. Despite cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis in normal rats, CSF bacterial concentrations were not lower. Normal rats cleared unencapsulated Rd-/b-/02 more effectively than leukopenic rats, with BBBP correlating with CSF bacterial density and not leukocyte concentrations. Challenge with heat-killed Rd-/b+/02 resulted in increased BBBP in both normal and leukopenic rats, with greater BBBP at higher bacterial concentrations. The data suggest: (a) significant increases in BBBP occur in the near absence of CSF leukocytes; (b) CSF leukocytes can augment changes in BBBP; (c) type b capsule inhibits host clearance mechanisms within the CSF; and (d) BBBP appears to correlate with bacterial concentrations within the CSF.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and dexamethasone on proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA levels in cultured pituitary adenoma cells were studied in 10 patients with Cushing's disease. As a control, POMC mRNA levels in cells from nonadenomatous tissues were examined in four patients. Human POMC mRNA in the cells was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization. Human POMC DNA probe hybridized with only a single size class of RNA (approximately 1,200 nucleotides) from the adenoma and nonadenoma cells of each patient. The size of POMC mRNA did not change through the culture or after incubation with CRH or dexamethasone. CRH increased POMC mRNA levels in these cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The minimum concentration of CRH required to elevate POMC mRNA levels in these cells exposed for 15 h was 0.1 nM. The minimum duration of 1 nM CRH treatment required to increase these levels was 3 h under our conditions. Inhibitory effects of 1 and 10 micrograms/dl dexamethasone on ACTH release and POMC mRNA levels in nonadenoma cells were greater than those in adenoma cells. These results suggest the following: (a) that the mRNA in cultured pituitary adenoma cells is qualitatively the same as that in vivo; (b) that responses of mRNA levels to CRH are time- and dose-dependent; and (c) that adenoma cells resist the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on POMC mRNA levels and ACTH release.\r"

To define the regulation of IL-1 synthesis by human MC, Northern blot analyses were performed using specific probes for monocytic IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA. Proliferating MC expressed mRNA for both IL-1 alpha and beta, whereas nonproliferating MC contained no detectable IL-1 mRNA. Synchronized MC expressed IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA within 2 h of stimulation with serum. This serum effect could be reproduced with platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor. Immune precipitations of 35S-methionine-labeled cells indicate that the mesangial IL-1 is synthesized as a 33-kD precursor protein with a pI of 7.2. Extracellular mesangial IL-1 has a pI of 7.0 and molecular weight of 17 kD, consistent with its identification as IL-1 beta. Cellular proliferation in glomerular disease may be driven in part by peptide growth factor-mediated induction of mesangial IL-1 gene expression and protein synthesis.\r"

This immunotoxin was cytotoxic to proliferating peripheral blood T cells in vitro as measured by both direct and indirect assays. Two sequential intravenous infusions into macaque monkeys achieved plasma concentrations of immunotoxin far in excess of those shown to be cytotoxic for cultured T cells and coated all T cells in lymph nodes and spleen with intact immunotoxin for four days. However, the cytotoxic effect of the immunotoxin on T cells in vivo was considerably less than that predicted by the in vitro studies. Further experiments suggested that the state of activation of the targeted T cell population in vivo, or the appearance of anti-immunotoxin antibodies, which occurred in all infused monkeys, might attenuate immunotoxin-mediated cell killing in vivo. These studies illustrate the significant differences between the action of immunotoxin conjugates in vitro, and those seen when these conjugates are utilized as therapeutic agents in vivo.\r"

Incubation of NK cells with IgE-anti-IgE immune complexes or IgA-anti-IgA immune complexes induced up to 10 and 20% FcER+ or FcAR+ cells, respectively. These FcR were induced on CD3- but not on CD3+ NKH-1+ cells. In contrast, NK cells from patients with various dysgammaglobulinemias could not be induced to express FcER or FcAR corresponding to their abnormal circulating IgE and/or IgA levels. Enriched FcER+ or FcAR+ induced NK cell supernatants from normals enhanced IgE or IgA synthesis from Ig secreting B cell lines in an isotype-specific fashion without increasing proliferation. Thus NK cells, after interaction with specific Ig isotypes in complexes, express FcR and produce differentiation factors for that isotype.\r"

  ".W": "Osteoinduction is the formation of ectopic bone that follows implantation of demineralized allogeneic bone matrix (DABM) and is believed to be secondary to the release of associated inductive factors from bone matrix. To clarify the role of vitamin D in osteoinduction, we implanted DABM from vitamin D-deficient rats (-D rats) into normal rats (+D rats). Because mitogens and osteocalcin might be involved in osteoinduction, these were measured. Mitogenic activity in extracts from mineralized allogeneic bone matrix (ABM) and DABM from both +D and -D rats was determined with an assay that utilizes monolayer cultures of embryonic chick calvarial cells. Osteocalcin in serum and DABM was measured by radioimmunoassay. DABM from -D rats did not promote osteoinduction as effectively as DABM from +D rats. Resorption of implant matrix from -D rats was diminished compared with resorption of matrix from +D rats (P less than 0.01), and the decrease was attributed to a corresponding decrease in the number of osteoclasts in the implants (P less than 0.02). Bone formation (P less than 0.01) and total implant mineralization (P less than 0.001) were significantly reduced in implants from -D rats, and the reductions corresponded with a decline in the number of osteoblasts (P less than 0.05). Mitogenic activity in DABM from +D rats was only slightly decreased as compared with activity in ABM, but DABM from -D rats contained significantly less activity (P less than 0.001). No mitogenic activity was identified in implants of DABM from either +D or -D rats 3 wk after implantation. Serum osteocalcin was significantly higher in -D as compared with +D animals. In contrast, the concentrations of osteocalcin in DABM from the two groups of animals were not significantly different from each other. These findings indicate that the diminished osteoinductive activity of DABM from -D rats results from deficiency of one or more mitogenic factors that are essential for inducing the proliferation and differentiation of bone cells at the implant site and that osteocalcin does not play a role in this regard.\r"

The development of emphysema in the hereditary PiZ AAT deficiency state suggests that inhibition of leukocyte elastase in the lung is a major function of this protein. In addition, patients with AAT deficiency are at increased risk for developing cholestasis in infancy and chronic liver disease as adults. The mechanism for hepatic cell injury, however, is not understood. Transgenic mice that express the normal human AAT gene demonstrate abundant AAT in hepatocytes and specific cell types of numerous nonhepatic tissues. Immunoperoxidase techniques have previously disclosed AAT in many of the cell types seen in transgenic mice; however, the issue of local synthesis vs. endocytosis in these cell types has remained unresolved. In this study, AAT mRNA was seen in a variety of tissues in the transgenic mouse. Immunoelectron microscopy of renal tubular and small intestinal epithelial cells in the transgenic mice demonstrated AAT within the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, as in hepatocytes. These findings support the possibility of local synthesis in the various cell types. The results suggest that in addition to maintaining tissue integrity in the lung, the protease/antiprotease balance may have physiological functions in other organs as well.\r"

We have found authentic human CRH (hCRH) mRNA in human placental tissue that is similar in size to hypothalamic CRH mRNA. Furthermore, the transcriptional initiation site for placental hCRH mRNA is identical to that previously predicted for hypothalamic hCRH mRNA, 23-26 nucleotides downstream from a canonical promoter element. Placental hCRH mRNA increases more than 20-fold in the 5 wk preceding parturition, in parallel with a rise in placental hCRH peptide content. These data strongly suggest that the hCRH gene is expressed in the placenta and that this expression changes dramatically during gestation.\r"

CLB-RAg 201 partly inhibits platelet adhesion to these surfaces, but this directly affects the interaction between von Willebrand factor and platelets and is not due to inhibition of binding of von Willebrand factor to these surfaces. Another MAb, CLB-RAg 38, does not inhibit the binding of von Willebrand factor to collagen. CLB-RAg 38 completely inhibits the binding of von Willebrand factor to extracellular matrices. CLB-RAg 38 inhibits platelet adhesion to cellular matrices completely insofar as it is dependent on plasma von Willebrand factor. CLB-RAg 38 does not inhibit the total binding of von Willebrand factor to subendothelium, as there are too many different binding sites, but it completely inhibits the functional binding sites for von Willebrand factor that support platelet adhesion. The epitopes for CLB-RAg 38 and 201 on the von Willebrand factor molecule are located on different fragments of the molecule.

Immunodiffusion-defined monospecific autoimmune sera to Ro/SS-A reacted with this synthetic peptide in ELISA, whereas autoantibodies with other specificities such as anti-La/SS-B and anti-Sm, as well as normal human sera, were not reactive. In addition, rabbit anti-peptide 6-19 antisera reacted specifically with native human Ro/SS-A antigen in ELISA. Furthermore, this synthetic peptide inhibited the binding of rabbit anti-peptide antiserum to native human Ro/SS-A. An additional synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 7-24 partially inhibited the binding of a patient anti-Ro/SS-A serum to native Ro/SS-A. These results suggest that the amino terminal portion of the molecule represents a major epitope of Ro/SS-A. The determination of the amino acid sequence of Ro/SS-A and the availability of synthetic peptide(s) bearing this antigen should provide additional approaches to further characterize the autoimmune response to this antigen.\r"

Using in situ nucleic acid hybridization methods, we show that there is HSV-encoded RNA in ganglion cells from 10 of 12 seropositive and zero of three seronegative patients studied at autopsy. Transcripts mapping to the region encoding the immediate-early polypeptide ICPO and the latency-associated transcript (LAT) were detected in the nuclei of these neurons. No other region of the HSV-1 genome was found to be expressed. When carefully defined probes were used to identify the transcripts, RNA corresponding to the LAT and, rarely, to ICPO was found. These results suggest that HSV-1 latency is an active process and that the LAT may be involved in regulating viral genetic expression.\r"

In this report, erythropoietin, the major hormone governing erythroid differentiation, was found to elicit an increase in Ca++ in human bone marrow mononuclear cells. Two chelators of intracellular calcium, quin 2 and the more specific and sensitive analogue, fura-2, were used to characterize the response evoked by both recombinant and native hormone. Erythropoietin caused a rapid, dose-dependent rise (within seconds) in Ca++ in bone marrow mononuclear cells, which could be prevented by preincubation of hormone with a rabbit erythropoietin antiserum. The erythropoietin response did not occur in purified populations of T- or B-lymphocytes. These studies suggested that increased Ca++ on erythropoietin binding may be an early transmembrane signal in hormone action.\r"

Among nine MAbs to vWF, MAb H9 inhibits binding of vWF to GPIb, MAb 9 blocks binding of vWF to GPIIb-IIIa, and MAbs B200 through B204 inhibit binding of vWF to collagen. Collagen-coated cover slips were exposed to human citrated blood at shear rates varying from 200 to 2600 sec-1 in parallel-plate perfusion chambers. Blood was reconstituted with washed radiolabeled platelets, erythrocytes, and citrated autologous plasma previously incubated with MAb IgG or F(ab')2. Platelet-collagen interactions were estimated by radioactive counting and by quantitative morphometry. Inhibition of 70% of platelet adhesion was observed at a concentration of 20 micrograms/ml MAb 9, similar to that observed with MAbs H9 or B202. The effect of each MAb was dose dependent, and their inhibitory effect on platelet adhesion was also shear rate dependent. Virtually 100% inhibition was observed at 2600 sec-1 shear rate when a mixture of the MAbs (H9 + 9 + B202) was added to reconstituted blood. Thus, blocking three functional domains of vWF virtually abolishes platelet-collagen adhesion at high shear rates, indicating that normal adhesion to collagen is mediated through binding of vWF to collagen and to both platelet membrane GPIb and GPIIb-IIIa.\r"

Effects of IL-1 such as fever, acute phase protein synthesis, hypotension, and loss of body mass are complications of hemodialysis. Endotoxin-contaminated dialysate fluid, sodium acetate as a dialysate buffer, and activated complement can induce IL-1 during hemodialysis. In the present study, we investigated the intrinsic property of hemodialysis membranes to stimulate human blood mononuclear cells (MNC) to produce IL-1. Incubation of MNC on sheets of two commonly used hemodialysis membranes, regenerated cellulose (RC) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) resulted in significant induction of IL-1 in the absence of endotoxin or complement. Production of intracellular and extracellular IL-1 was greater in MNC exposed to PAN compared with RC (p less than 0.01). Similar results were obtained when MNC were exposed to strips of hemodialysis membranes in rotating tubes. However, compared with RC, PAN binds significant amounts of human IL-1. In a model of in vitro hemodialysis, radiolabeled recombinant human IL-1 was added to the blood compartment of a PAN and a RC dialyzer. Forty percent of radiolabeled IL-1 bound to the PAN dialyzer membrane compared with 10% to the membrane of a RC dialyzer. In addition, 22% of radiolabeled IL-1 was found in the dialysate compartment of a PAN dialyzer after 1 hour whereas 1% was found in the dialysate side of a RC dialyzer; these results were confirmed by measuring bioactivity of IL-1. These studies demonstrate the intrinsic property of hemodialysis membranes to stimulate human IL-1 production; in addition they establish that dialysis membranes differ in their ability to bind and clear IL-1.\r"

Murine IgG monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) against human thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and human TSH receptors were also used as antigens in parallel ELISA assays. Patients with active and patients with inactive Graves' disease showed elevations of IgG anti-F(ab')2 antibodies when compared with normal controls. Similarly, both active and inactive Graves' disease sera showed higher levels of IgG anti-LE4, a mouse Mab to human TSH, than was seen with normal controls. However, F(ab')2 isolated from sera reacting with LE4 in the ELISA did not inhibit binding of the LE4 Mab with labeled TSH in a fluid phase competition assay. Patients with inactive Graves' disease showed higher ELISA reactivity with two different murine anti-TSH receptor Mabs than was recorded with either active Graves' or normal controls. A rough inverse correlation was noted between strongly positive ELISA reactions against these two Mabs with anti-TSH receptor specificity and the ability of immunoglobulins from inactive Graves' sera to stimulate increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the normal rat thyroid cell line assay. Untreated Graves' sera showing high cAMP release only rarely showed elevated ELISA reactivity against Mabs with anti-TSH receptor activity.\r"

This form of therapy has been complicated by the development of fluid retention, azotemia, and hypophosphatemia. To evaluate the effects of IL-2 on renal function, we prospectively studied eight patients who received IL-2 (10(5) micron/kg every eight hours intravenously [IV]) for five days as the initial phase of a treatment protocol using IL-2 plus lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells. Dopamine and fluids were used to maintain blood pressure and all patients received indomethacin (100 mg/d). IL-2 therapy produced a syndrome similar to endotoxemia with the development of respiratory alkalosis (pH = 7.44 +/- .2, pCO2 = 30 +/- 2) and hypotension (mean BP, 71.3 mm Hg). These changes were accompanied by marked sodium avidity, edema formation, and mild elevations of BUN and creatinine. Hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia were commonly seen. No defects in renal calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, net acid excretion, or glycosuria were demonstrated. We conclude: (1) IL-2 induces an increase in vascular permeability causing the development of edema, sodium avidity, and prerenal azotemia as occurs during endotoxemia; (2) IL-2 therapy induces respiratory alkalosis with the subsequent intracellular shift of phosphorous accompanied by increased renal phosphorous reabsorption; and (3) there is no evidence of renal tubular dysfunction (renal tubular acidosis [RTA], renal leak of glucose, phosphorous, or magnesium).\r"

Following the two-hour infusion of dl-CF, mean peak plasma concentration and elimination half-life of I-5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid (I-CF) were 24 +/- 6 mumol/L and 0.8 +/- 0.1 hour, respectively. CI of dl-CF over five days yielded a mean steady-state plasma level of I-CF of only 1.2 +/- 0.5 mumol/L. Peak and steady-state plasma concentrations of the metabolite 5-methyl tetrahydrofolic acid were comparable in the two schedules (17 +/- 8 mumol/L for the two-hour infusion and 12 +/- 5 mumol/L for the CI). Areas under the concentration v time curve (AUC) of total reduced folates were significantly greater under conditions of CI: 89.0 v 16.7 mmol/L/min for the two-hour infusion. In tumor tissue, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate increased eight-fold two to four hours following the two-hour infusion and two-fold during the CI of dl-CF and FUra. Inhibition of thymidylate synthase (dTMP-S) by the two-hour and CI infusion schedules were 66% v 39%, respectively. The observed differences in the intracellular dTMP-S folate cofactor pools and the degree of inhibition of dTMP-S achieved in patients treated by two different schedules may be due to differences in the biochemical properties and/or to differences in the modulation of FUra metabolism by folate of tumor tissues obtained from newly diagnosed and previously treated patients.\r"

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from all subjects showed high levels of cytotoxicity against these targets. There was no significant difference between the patients and the control group when LAK cytotoxicity was compared. Thus, although glioma patients are known to have depressed immunological reactivity, the cytotoxic capacity of LAK cells derived from glioma patients is similar to that of LAK cells from healthy control subjects. However, the glioma patients had significantly reduced numbers of mononuclear cells in their peripheral blood, possibly due to steroid treatment. Therefore, the volume of blood required to generate the same number of LAK cells was approximately three times larger from the glioma patients than from control subjects.\r"

Hemoglobin (10(-5)M) markedly augmented contractions induced by 5-HT (10(-9) to 10(-6)M) and slightly augmented those induced by KCl (20 to 80 mM) in arteries with intact endothelium. On the other hand, the augmentation induced by hemoglobin was almost abolished in arteries that were chemically denuded of endothelial cells by pretreatment with saponin. Since hemoglobin is known to be a selective inhibitor of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), it is possible that the augmentation of contraction by hemoglobin in endothelium-intact arteries was mediated via an inhibition of spontaneously released EDRF. The effect of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on spontaneously released EDRF was investigated by injecting 5 ml of blood into the cisterna magna and sacrificing the rabbits 2 days later. Arteries after SAH showed a significant reduction in hemoglobin-induced augmentation compared to that seen in control arteries with intact endothelium. This result suggests that spontaneously released EDRF is significantly reduced after SAH. It is concluded that EDRF is released spontaneously in the rabbit basilar artery and that inhibition of its release might be involved in pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm.\r"

Fifty-one patients underwent both stress-delayed SPECT imaging using a rotational gamma camera and stress-rest PET imaging using a high resolution PET camera. Of 48 CAD patients, SPECT showed abnormal perfusion in 46 patients (96%), while PET detected perfusion abnormalities in 47 (98%). The sensitivity for detecting disease in individual coronary arteries (greater than 50% stenosis) was also similar for SPECT (81%) and PET (88%). When their interpretations were classified as normal, transient defect, and fixed defect in 765 myocardial segments, SPECT and PET findings were concordant in 606 segments (79%). However, 66 segments showed a fixed defect by SPECT but a transient defect by PET, whereas there were only nine segments showing a transient defect by SPECT and a fixed defect by PET. PET identified transient defects in 34% of the myocardial segments showing a fixed defect by SPECT. We conclude that both stress SPECT and PET showed high and similar sensitivities for detecting CAD and individual stenosed vessels. Since stress-delayed SPECT with single tracer injection detected fewer transient defects, it may underestimate the presence of myocardial ischemia, compared with high resolution PET imaging with two tracer injections.\r"

Male Lewis rats with renal failure due to bilateral ligation of ureters and sham-operated controls (ZOX and CZX), as well as rats with uranyl nitrate-induced renal dysfunction and saline-injected controls (ZOX only), received an infusion of ZOX or CZX until onset of loss of righting reflex. Drug concentrations in serum, brain and cerebrospinal fluid at that time were substantially lower in animals with renal failure or dysfunction than in normal controls. The ZOX concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid correlated negatively with indices of renal function (serum creatinine and urea concentrations). Administration of a concentrated dialyzate of serum from rats with uranyl nitrate-induced renal dysfunction to normal animals also decreased the concentrations of ZOX at onset of loss of righting reflex. Thus, the sensitivity of the central nervous system of rats to the depressant action of ZOX and CZX is significantly increased by renal failure. This effect appears to be mediated, at least in part, by an endogenous, dialyzable substance that accumulates in the blood of rats with impaired renal function.\r"

The proliferative response depended on the presence of histocompatible antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the cultures in the form of either autologous lymphoid cell lines (Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells) or histocompatible peripheral blood lymphocytes and was maximal at 3 days. Presentation appeared to be via class II major histocompatibility complex antigens, in that monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the class II antigens, but not the class I antigens, on the APCs inhibited the proliferative responses. The response the CTLs appeared to be mediated by interaction with the alpha beta CD3 T-cell receptor complex, in that pretreatment of the CTL clones with MAbs against CD3 inhibited the response of these clones to the antigen extracts irrespective of the phenotypes of the clones. Extracts from several nonmelanoma cells did not stimulate CTL clones specific for melanoma. At least two different specificities were detected in extracts from autologous and allogeneic tumor cells. The specificity of proliferative responses by CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ CTLs appeared to be similar to their cytotoxic activity, but CTLs with the CD3+ CD16+ CD8+- phenotype had wider cytotoxic activity against target cells not stimulating proliferative responses. The antigen(s) responsible for the stimulation were shown in all instances to have a molecular mass of 48 kilodaltons. Preliminary analysis suggested that the antigen(s) have both protein and glycolipid (ganglioside) components.\r"

The mean number of years of marijuana smoking was 13.7. The mean number of daily marijuana cigarettes smoked was 3.4. The clinical trial consisted of five consecutive days of 50 minute aversion therapy sessions (faradic, rapid smoking, and quick puffing) utilizing THC-free marijuana. Three weekly 60 minute group cohort sessions in self-management counseling followed. The treatment period spanned four weeks. Pretreatment and posttreatment (one month interval) the Shipley Institute of Living Scale was administered to measure changes in both cognitive functioning and organic brain dysfunction. All 22 subjects achieved abstinence (by self-report) by the end of the five days of aversion therapy; 19 of 21 subjects (90.5%) reported abstinence at the conclusion of the clinical trial, following the group sessions. At six months post treatment follow-up 15 of the 20 subjects (75.0%) reported abstinence; at 12 month posttreatment follow-up 16 of the 19 subjects (84.2%) achieved abstinence. The mean number of daily marijuana cigarettes smoked by the subjects decreased from a baseline pretreatment level of 3.40 to 0 at the conclusion of aversion therapy, .07 at the conclusion of the clinical trial, .26 at six month posttreatment follow-up and .23 at the 12 month posttreatment follow-up. The mean scores on the Shipley Institute of Living Scale, were: IQ 106 and CQ 92 at pretreatment; IQ 112 and CQ 104 at posttreatment. The difference in these means was significant for both intelligence and conceptual quotient. The investigators conclude that the treatment procedure offers promise as a marijuana smoking cessation treatment program.\r"

On the other hand, RLNL exhibited the same level of cytotoxicity against autologous tumor cells as PBL, although the cytotoxicities against K562 and QG-56 were low. Cytotoxicity of RLNL against autologous tumor cells exhibited a significant degree of depression with the advance of stage, T and N factors. Cytotoxicity of PBL did not significantly change as the stage progressed. When both PBL and RLNL were cultured with purified interleukin-2 (p-IL2) in vitro, their cytotoxic activities were markedly augmented and the cytotoxicities could not be diminished by the treatment with anti-Leu-7 + anti-Leu-11b + C'. These facts indicate that the augmented cytotoxicity may be due to lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells.\r"

The tumor was located in the lower pole of the left lobe and the isthmus of the thyroid, and it had invaded the thyroid parenchyma, thyroid capsule, adjacent connective tissue, and neck muscles. Continuity between the cervical thymus and the tumor was noted. Subsequently, the patient developed widespread metastases in the liver, lungs, bones, and lymph nodes without local recurrence. Histologic examination disclosed a solid growth of epithelial cells with squamous cell differentiation and keratinization. The tumor cells had an ill-defined cell border and large nuclei with large nucleoli. Moderate mitoses and slight necrosis of the tumor were seen. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the tumor cells were stained positively for keratin but not for calcitonin or thyroglobulin. There were infiltrations of lymphocytes in the tumor and fibrous stroma, and most of them proved to be T cells.\r"

  ".W": "We studied survival rates among 767 men with good left ventricular function who participated in the European Coronary Surgery Study, 10 to 12 years after they were randomly assigned to either early coronary bypass surgery or medical therapy. At the projected five-year follow-up interval, we observed a significantly higher survival rate (+/- 95 percent confidence interval) in the group that was assigned to surgical treatment than in the group assigned to medical treatment (92.4 +/- 2.7 vs. 83.1 +/- 3.9 percent; P = 0.0001). During the subsequent seven years, the percentage of patients who survived decreased more rapidly in the surgically treated than in the medically treated group (70.6 +/- 5.8 vs. 66.7 +/- 5.3 percent at 12 years). Thus, the improvement in the survival rate among patients with stable angina who were treated surgically appears to have been attenuated after five years. However, the gradually diminishing difference between the two survival curves still favored surgical treatment after 12 years (P = 0.04), despite the fact that 136 patients in the medically treated group had coronary bypass surgery and 23 in the \"surgically treated\" group did not. The benefit of surgical treatment tended to be greater, but not significantly so, as assessed by interaction analysis in the subgroups of patients who were older or who had signs of ischemia or previous infarction on the resting electrocardiogram, a markedly ischemic response to exercise testing, peripheral arterial disease, an absence of hypertension, and proximal obstruction in the left anterior descending artery. The reasons for the loss of a beneficial effect of surgery after five years are unknown and merit further study.\r"

A link between the vulnerability of nigral neurons and the prominent pigmentation of the substantia nigra, though long suspected, has not been proved. This possibility is supported by evidence that N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and its metabolite MPP+, the latter of which causes destruction of nigral neurons, bind to neuromelanin. We have directly tested this hypothesis by a quantitative analysis of neuromelanin-pigmented neurons in control and parkinsonian midbrains. The findings demonstrate first that the dopamine-containing cell groups of the normal human midbrain differ markedly from each other in the percentage of neuromelanin-pigmented neurons they contain. Second, the estimated cell loss in these cell groups in Parkinson's disease is directly correlated (r = 0.97, P = 0.0057) with the percentage of neuromelanin-pigmented neurons normally present in them. Third, within each cell group in the Parkinson's brains, there is greater relative sparing of non-pigmented than of neuromelanin-pigmented neurons. This evidence suggests a selective vulnerability of the neuromelanin-pigmented subpopulation of dopamine-containing mesencephalic neurons in Parkinson's disease.\r"

The proportion of patients with active disease was greater in infants and toddlers; 2 of whom also had meningitis. Two children with active disease were infected with human immunodeficiency virus, 1 of whom died with cavitary tuberculosis. Only 43% of 211 patients were born in the United States. The ethnic distribution was Hispanic 45%, Oriental 30%, Black 18% and other 7%. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination was documented in 53 (25%) patients; 5 (9%) of these developed active disease. Despite vaccination and the availability of effective drugs, tuberculosis persists and appears to be increasing. Meeting the challenge of tuberculosis in the future will require more rapid diagnostic methods and recognition of the burden of infection in human immunodeficiency disease-infected children, together with revitalization of screening and follow-up programs, especially for toddlers and adolescents.\r"

The most frequent clinical features at presentation were persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (14 of 14), hepatosplenomegaly (11 of 14) and a history of recurrent otitis media (7 of 14). Except for hypergammaglobulinemia (14 of 14) and reversed T4/T8 ratios (9 of 14), immunologic analyses, including in vitro responses to mitogens and antibody responses following immunization, revealed no consistent abnormalities. Over the course of follow-up, none of the patients have developed serious or opportunistic infections and 12 of 14 have shown catch up or age-appropriate growth. The T4/T8 ratios have remained stable in 8 of 11 and improved in 2 of 11 patients. Gradual regression of hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy has been noted patients. Although follow-up studies over a longer period are needed to confirm our observations to date, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex may represent a prolonged plateau in the course of human immunodeficiency virus infection in many infected children. Detailed immunologic evaluation of these patients may help to identify a subset of children that could benefit from periodic gamma-globulin or chronic antibiotic therapy.\r"

Receptor mRNA levels were quantified by DNA-excess solution hybridization by using a 170-nucleotide single-stranded probe derived from the hamster beta 2AR cDNA. RNA blot analysis of poly(A)+-selected RNA with the solution probe revealed a 2.2-kilobase species. Digestion of the RNA/solution probe mixture with S1 endonuclease revealed a single species of RNA (170 bases) that was protected by the solution probe. DDT1 MF-2 cells were found to contain 0.38 pg of beta AR mRNA per microgram of total cellular RNA. Incubation (16 hr) with isoproterenol decreased beta AR mRNA levels in cells by 40%. This agonist-induced decrease in receptor mRNA levels was found to be dependent on the time of incubation and the dose of agonist. The decrease in beta AR mRNA was half-maximal at 0.1-0.5 microM isoproterenol. The beta-adrenergic antagonists CGP 20712A (beta 1-selective) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2-selective) blocked in a dose-dependent fashion the ability of isoproterenol to effect receptor mRNA levels. The beta 2-adrenergic antagonist displayed a potency 25-fold greater than that of the beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, in agreement with the subtype of receptor (beta 2) expressed by these cells. For down-regulated cells in which receptor mRNA levels declined in response to agonist, the addition of the antagonist ligand (-)-propranolol (1 microM) was able to restore receptor mRNA levels to 90% of the control value within 12 hr. Full recovery of steady-state beta AR mRNA was achieved within 60 hr. These studies provide a molecular explanation for the down-regulation of GTP-binding regulatory protein (G protein)-linked cell-surface receptors that accompanies desensitization.\r"

Physiol. Chem. 361, 1389-1399]. In excellent agreement with the x-ray data, helices occur in the regions of residues 17-28 and 36-43 in solution. In contrast to the x-ray data, where a third long helix was found from residue 47 to residue 73, the solution data show a shorter helix in the region from residue 47 to residue 66, followed by a transition range at positions 67-70, leading into a six-residue carboxyl-terminal peptide in dynamic random coil conformation. At the amino terminus, a well-defined helix is observed in solution for the residues 8-15 region, which, like the carboxyl terminus, gradually changes to dynamic random coil toward the end of the polypeptide chain. This is at variance with the x-ray data as well, in which residues 13-15 are nonhelical and no electron density could be assigned to the first 12 residues due to disorder.\r"

  ".U": "88276897\r", 
  ".W": "Many cells exhibit periodic transient increases in cytosolic calcium levels rather than a sustained rise when stimulated by a hormone or growth factor. We propose here a molecular model that accounts for periodic calcium spiking induced by a constant stimulus. Four elements give rise to repetitive calcium transients: cooperativity and positive feedback between a pair of reciprocally coupled (crosscoupled) messengers, followed by deactivation and then by reactivation. The crosscoupled messengers in our model are inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and cytosolic calcium ions. The opening of calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum by the binding of multiple molecules of InsP3 provides the required cooperativity. The stimulation of receptor-activated phospholipase C by released calcium ions leads to positive feedback. InsP3 is destroyed by a phosphatase, and calcium ion is pumped back into the endoplasmic reticulum. These processes generate bistability: the cytosolic calcium concentration abruptly increases from a basal level to a stimulated level at a threshold degree of activation of phospholipase C. Spiking further requires slow deactivation and subsequent reactivation. In our model, mitochondrial sequestration of calcium ion prevents the cytosolic level from increasing above several micromolar and enables the system to return to the basal state. When the endoplasmic reticulum calcium store is refilled to a critical level by the Ca2+-ATPase pump, cooperative positive feedback between the InsP3-gated channel and phospholipase C begins again to give the next calcium spike. The time required for the calcium level in the endoplasmic reticulum to reach a threshold sets the interval between spikes. The amplitude, shape, and period of calcium spikes calculated for this model are like those observed experimentally.\r"

In the somatic macronucleus of Tetrahymena, the rDNA is in the form of linear palindromic molecules. The rDNA molecules from the C3 strain have a replication advantage over rDNA from both B strain and the C3 rDNA mutant rmm1. We constructed two circular plasmids carrying replication origin sequences from C3 rDNA and a point mutation (Pmr) in the 17S rRNA gene that confers resistance to the antibiotic paromomycin. One plasmid contained a single complete copy of the rRNA gene and its flanking sequences, while the other had an additional rDNA origin of replication. In all B or rmm1 Tetrahymena cell lines transformed with the plasmids, rDNA sequences from the plasmid were found in palindromic rDNA molecules. In one transformant line, a small amount of the plasmid was also retained in a form with the original circular restriction map. Our results show that the plasmids underwent homologous recombination with one arm of the endogenous rDNA to give heteropalindromic rDNA, or with both arms of the palindrome to form homopalindromic rDNA. The resulting recombinant molecules were able to replace the recipient's original rDNA completely, providing strong evidence that C3 rDNA sequences in the donor DNAs confer a replication advantage over recipient rDNA. Thus microinjection of circular plasmids provides a method for replacement of an endogenous gene or gene fragment with exogenous sequences.\r"

Recombination occurs at a specific site, called lox, and does not require any other protein factors. The Cre protein is shown here also to be able to cause synapsis of DNA and site-specific recombination in a mammalian cell line. A stable mouse cell line was established that expresses the Cre protein under the control of the Cd2+-inducible metallothionein I gene promoter. DNA recombination was monitored with DNA substrates containing two directly repeated lox sites. One such substrate is a circular plasmid with two directly repeated lox sites (lox2) flanking a marker gene and was introduced into cells by Ca3(PO4)2 transformation. As a second substrate we used a pseudorabies virus (a herpesvirus) containing a lox2 insertion designed to provide a sensitive detection system for recombination. In both cases, site-specific recombination in vivo is dependent on the presence of the Cre protein and occurs specifically at the 34-base-pair lox sites. These results demonstrate the controlled site-specific synapsis of DNA and recombination by a prokaryotic protein in mammalian cells and suggest that Cre-mediated site-specific recombination may be a useful tool for understanding and modulating genome rearrangements in eukaryotes.\r"

  ".W": "The amino acid sequence corresponding to residues 107-116 of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) has been identified as containing an immunodominant T-cell epitope recognized in association with the I-Ed molecule. The immunodominance of this epitope in HEL-primed H-2d mice was demonstrated by analysis of the T-cell proliferative response induced by synthetic peptides covering almost the entire HEL sequence. All the T-cell hybridomas from H-2d mice analyzed recognize the HEL sequence 107-116 in association with the I-Ed molecule. Correlating with the restriction of T-cell recognition, HEL-(105-120)-peptide binds to I-Ed but not to I-Ad molecules. Conservative or semiconservative substitutions at positions 113 (Asn----Lys), 114 (Arg----His), or 115 (Cys----Ala) abrogate the ability of HEL-(105-120) to activate T cells. Substitutions at residues 113 and 115 affect T-cell recognition but not the binding to I-Ed molecules, whereas, as shown by binding data and competition experiments, an Arg----His substitution at position 114 profoundly impairs the capacity of the peptide to interact with I-Ed molecules. In agreement with these results, [Lys113]HEL-(105-120)-peptide but not [His114]HEL-(105-120)-peptide was found to be immunogenic in H-2d mice. Thus, a single semiconservative substitution drastically reduces binding capacity and abolishes immunogenicity, suggesting that a strict correlation exists between binding of a peptide to Ia molecules and its immunogenicity.\r"

We have extended this finding to show that, directly after removal from the mouse, antigen-presenting cells from a variety of tissues stimulate our hemoglobin-specific hybridomas without any manipulation or addition of exogenous antigen. This constitutes direct functional proof that in a nondisease state self proteins are processed constitutively and can be presented in a fashion similar to that in which foreign antigens are presented. Our demonstration that antigen-presenting cells can process and potentially present self as well as foreign molecules implies that self-tolerance occurs at the level of the T cell. This constitutive processing and presentation of self antigens has potentially far-reaching implications in self-tolerance, autoimmunity, and alloreactivity.\r"

Although it appears likely that these cytokines are involved in regulation of trabecular bone turnover, nothing is known of their effects on extracellular fluid calcium concentration. In this report, we show the effects of 72-hr subcutaneous infusions of interleukins 1 alpha and -beta on plasma calcium and bone morphology in mice. Both interleukins 1 caused a marked dose-dependent increase in the plasma calcium. In higher doses, which cause the animals to die, the plasma calcium fell preterminally. Quantitative histomorphometry of bone sections showed evidence of increased numbers of osteoclasts and bone resorption surfaces. The effects were similar to those obtained with infusions of parathyroid hormone. These data suggest that in addition to its potential influence on trabecular bone volume, interleukin 1 may also modulate extracellular fluid calcium homeostasis under conditions in which it is produced excessively.\r"

  ".U": "88276933\r", 
  ".W": "The \"debrisoquine polymorphism\" is a clinically important genetic defect of drug metabolism affecting 5-10% of individuals in Caucasian populations. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. A full-length cDNA for human cytochrome P-450db1, the deficient enzyme (also designated P450IID1 for P450 family II subfamily D isozyme 1), has recently been cloned. Leukocyte DNA from \"extensive metabolizers\" (EMs) or \"poor metabolizers\" (PMs) of debrisoquine was examined by Southern analysis. Two polymorphic restriction fragments were associated with the PM phenotype when DNAs from 24 unrelated PM and 29 unrelated EM individuals were probed with P-450db1 cDNA after digestion with Xba I restriction endonuclease and Southern blotting: a polymorphic 44-kilobase (kb) fragment was found in 58% of PMs but only in 3.4% of EMs, and a polymorphic 11.5-kb fragment was present in 33% of PMs but in none of the EMs. Seventy-five percent of PMs had either the 44-kb or the 11.5-kb fragment or both. Segregation of these restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the families of six PM probands demonstrated that each of the two fragments is allelic with the 29-kb fragment present in all EM individuals and suggests that they identify two independent mutated allels of the P-450db1 gene (designated P450C2D1). At least a third mutated allele not detected by these restriction fragment length polymorphisms must be present in the population. The Xba I 44-kb fragment and 11.5-kb fragment were in linkage disequilibrium with restriction fragment length polymorphisms generated by four and five additional restriction endonucleases, respectively, which can be used to identify the same mutant alleles for the P-450db1 gene.\r"

One mutation produced a nonfunctioning allele in that there was synthesis of mRNA but no detectable synthesis of pro alpha 2(I) chains from the allele. The mutation in the other allele caused synthesis of shortened pro alpha 2(I) chains that lacked most or all of the 18 amino acids encoded by exon 28. Subclones of the pro alpha 2(I) gene were prepared from the proband's DNA and the DNA sequence was determined for a 582-base-pair (bp) region that extended from the last 30 bp of intervening sequence 26 to the first 26 bp of intervening sequence 29. Data from six independent subclones demonstrated that all had the same sequence as a previously isolated normal clone for the pro alpha 2(I) gene except that four subclones had a single base mutation at the 3' end of intervening sequence 27. The mutation was a substitution of guanine for adenine that changed the universal consensus sequence for the 3' splicing site of RNA from -AG- to -GG-. S1 nuclease experiments demonstrated that about half the pro alpha 2(I) mRNA in the proband's fibroblasts was abnormally spliced and that the major species of abnormal pro alpha 2(I) mRNA was completely spliced from the last codon of exon 27 to the first codon of exon 29. The mutation is apparently unique among RNA splicing mutations of mammalian systems in producing a shortened polypeptide chain that is in-frame in terms of coding sequences, that is used in the subunit assembly of a protein, and that contributes to a lethal phenotype.\r"

Because MR imaging is highly sensitive to changes in water distribution, these changes should be detectable under appropriate imaging conditions. Imaging of the forearms and/or legs was performed in 16 volunteers at 0.35 T, before and after exercise. Exercises included finger flexion and extension, wrist flexion, ankle plantar flexion, and great toe extension. In the case of handgrip exercise, the level of exertion was quantitated. Individual muscles were frequently indistinguishable on preexercise scans. After exercise, active and inactive muscles could be clearly distinguished. For example, in the flexor digitorum profundus, finger flexion resulted in an increase in the image-derived estimate of T1 (T1 postexercise was 1037 +/- 162 msec vs T1 preexercise of 590 +/- 49 msec, p less than .001). T2 also increased (T2 postexercise was 35 +/- 2 msec vs T2 preexercise of 28 +/- 1 msec, p less than .001). Relative spin density also increased (p less than .001). T1, T2, and spin density subsequently decreased with time but were still increased above baseline at 10 min postexercise (p less than .005). Signal changes correlated moderately with the level of exertion (r = .63) and fatigue (r = .45). Vascular occlusion did not prevent intensity changes. Thus, changes in skeletal muscle MR signal intensity occur with exercise and appear to parallel known alterations in water distribution.\r"

  ".U": "88279261\r", 
  ".W": "Over the past 3 years, three radiographic contrast media that are lower in osmolality than traditional contrast media have become available in the United States. These lower osmolality media have been reported to produce fewer adverse reactions than the higher osmolality media, but they cost 10 to 20 times more than higher osmolality media. To explore hospital and physician decision-making regarding the use of lower osmolality media in the increasingly price-sensitive health-care environment, we surveyed the 40 hospitals in the United States that received the most funding from the National Institutes of Health in 1985. Radiologists in 27 (68%) of the hospitals responded. Of these, 93% believed lower osmolality media improve the quality of patient care. However, nearly half of responding institutions limited the use of lower osmolality media. On average, in 1986 lower osmolality media were used in 9% of procedures in which contrast media were injected intravascularly. The decision to limit use was made primarily by radiologists, rather than hospital administrators, and was based on concerns regarding the high price of lower osmolality media. Twelve respondents had developed guidelines for appropriate use of lower osmolality media, but only 25% of these had developed mechanisms to ensure or increase compliance with those guidelines. Only one respondent (4%) reported that he routinely informs patients of the issues and tradeoffs involved in deciding whether to use lower or higher osmolality media. We conclude that cost is an important factor in physicians' and hospitals' choices of contrast media and that increased attention should be given to defining appropriate procedures to follow when informed consent is obtained for the use of contrast material.\r"

  ".W": "Subcarinal lymph nodes are commonly involved by metastases from cancers of both the right and left lungs. No data exist on the relative accuracy of radiologic methods for evaluating subcarinal nodes. We prospectively studied lung cancer patients who were surgical candidates with CT, MR imaging (0.35 T), esophagography, and anteroposterior tomography. Forty-six patients who subsequently underwent thoracotomy had excision or sampling of subcarinal nodes at mediastinoscopy. All 46 had CT scans, 27 had MR imaging, 23 had esophagography, and 21 had anteroposterior tomography. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were constructed for each technique, and the area under each curve was calculated. MR and CT were nearly identical in subcarinal evaluation, with areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves of 0.90 and 0.86, respectively; both were superior to esophagography (0.55) and anteroposterior tomography (0.61). The size threshold at which subcarinal nodes were considered abnormally enlarged in this lung cancer population was 11 mm in short axis for CT, agreeing with the size threshold previously reported for a normal population. The size threshold for abnormal nodal enlargement with MR imaging was 18 mm in short axis. We conclude that CT and MR imaging are comparable in the detection of subcarinal lymphadenopathy and are superior to both tomography and esophagography. Different size thresholds for metastatic subcarinal nodes are needed for CT and MR imaging to be comparable in overall performance.\r"

This procedure was performed under CT guidance in eight patients with pancreatic pseudocysts. There was no communication with the pancreatic duct at the time of initial aspiration. Communication was later demonstrated in six of eight patients and persisted for the entire duration of drainage. Resolution of the cysts occurred in seven of the eight patients. In one patient an infection of the pancreatic collection developed that required surgery. As with abdominal abscess drainage, a preexisting fistula may be opacified only after several days of catheter drainage and cannot be predicted at the time of initial aspiration. The percutaneous transgastric approach mimics the surgical approach and allows a mature tract to form from the cyst to the stomach. This eliminates the risk of a pancreaticocutaneous fistula and permits tube removal within a reasonable period of time.\r"

These may contain mature teratoma, fibrotic tissue, or tumor. Mature teratoma, which is unresponsive to chemotherapy, may result from evolution of a malignant lesion during treatment, or it may represent a metastasis from a focus of mature teratoma in the primary testicular tumor. An enlarging retroperitoneal mass during the course of chemotherapy is usually due to treatment failure but rarely may be due to an enlarging mature teratoma, the so-called growing teratoma syndrome. This report concerns five patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors metastatic to the retroperitoneum in whom mature teratomas were found at surgery. These tumors had grown despite the administration of combination systemic chemotherapy, and the cystic component had increased in size. Three patients had evidence of urinary tract compression, three had vascular compression or displacement, and one had gastrointestinal compression. The retroperitoneal mass was excised in each patient, and all are alive 4-27 months after surgery without evidence of recurrence. Growing mature teratoma is unresponsive to chemotherapy but is cured by surgical excision. The possibility of the growing teratoma syndrome should be considered so that these lesions can be treated appropriately.\r"

Seven hundred forty-three consecutive TMJ arthrograms were successfully obtained in a total of 443 patients by using a single 27-gauge needle and a two-compartment technique in each joint. There was a 100% correlation with surgical findings in 218 radiologically abnormal joints operated on within 90 days of arthrography with respect to the presence or degree of meniscus displacement and normal or abnormal disk morphology and function. In 604 patients 1052 TMJs were studied with high-field-strength surface-coil MR. Surgical findings were available for correlation in 170 of the joints studied. Forty-three joints were studied with both two-compartment arthrography and MR. Eight operated joints had been imaged successfully with both two-compartment arthrography and MR. Both methods of evaluation provided highly reliable and accurate information regarding meniscus position and shape. Arthrography was superior to MR in detecting capsular adhesions and the presence or absence of perforation of the disk or meniscus attachments. Simple meniscectomy (with or without insertion of a temporary Silastic TMJ implant) was the most frequently performed surgical procedure in the series, followed by meniscus repositioning procedures. Joint effusions, failed TMJ implants, and avascular necrosis were demonstrated best with MR. Soft-tissue lesions, including intrinsic degeneration of the meniscus, anomalous muscle development, muscle atrophy, tendinitis, and injuries such as contusions and hematomas, were demonstrated only with MR. Partial-flip-angle GRASS (gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state) techniques permit both fast scanning and study of functional joint dynamic. Joint fluid may appear as high signal intensity on GRASS images because of T2*-weighting. We recommend MR as the procedure of choice for diagnosis of uncomplicated internal derangements of the TMJ. Two-compartment arthrography with videofluoroscopy is an important ancillary procedure that should be performed whenever capsular adhesions or perforations are suspected and not demonstrated with MR and whenever MR is inconclusive.\r"

The fragment was seen on the pronation oblique and/or lateral projections, but not on the posteroanterior projection. The radiographic appearance of the fragment was remarkably similar in all cases. In the one patient in which it was performed, pluridirectional tomography demonstrated that the fragment originated from the dorsal surface of the hamate. Five of the six patients also had associated posterior dislocation of the fourth and/or fifth metacarpals. We conclude that this fragment represents a coronal fracture through the body of the hamate resulting from posterior dislocation or subluxation of the fourth and/or fifth metacarpal.\r"

Four women had bilateral involvement and one man had unilateral involvement. The patients were 23-71 years old. The disorder was initially described by Mueller and Weiss and should not be confused with Koehler disease (osteochondrosis of the tarsal navicular in children). This group of patients was compared with five other patients (29-74 years old) with similar radiographic and clinical changes in whom an underlying disease (rheumatoid arthritis, renal failure, trauma, and lupus erythematosus) associated with osteonecrosis was known. Routine radiography in both groups defined characteristic abnormalities of the navicular bone (decreased size, a comma-shaped configuration, increased radiodensity, fragmentation, and medial or medial and dorsal osseous protrusion). MR in three patients confirmed alterations consistent with osteonecrosis. Three of the patients without underlying disease had bilateral involvement on plain films, with flat feet and hindfoot valgus deformity, leading to local pain and deformity. In a fourth patient, bilateral distribution was documented by MR as marrow alterations. Although no certain pathogenic explanation for spontaneous osteonecrosis of the tarsal navicular is known, trauma and chronic stress changes caused by physiologic pressure on the medial longitudinal arch in hindfoot valgus and increased tension forces of the plantar aponeurosis during weight-bearing (in pes planus) may be important. Discrimination of primary from secondary osteonecrosis of the tarsal navicular bone is not possible by radiologic means alone, although bilateral distribution, particularly in women, favors the diagnosis of spontaneous disease.\r"

White matter disease categories included demyelinating disease (five cases), dysmyelinating disease (eight cases), developmental white matter abnormalities (four cases), and white matter abnormalities of unknown origin (idiopathic) (six cases), as seen on long TR images. We found that MR is not more sensitive than CT in detecting disease in the demyelinating or dysmyelinating categories, although it is more sensitive than CT in detecting the degree of disease present. In cases of developmental delay, MR is distinctly more useful than CT in demonstrating abnormalities of myelination. And in the idiopathic group, MR detected the presence of focal white matter abnormalities on long TR images in children with neurologic complaints and normal CT. MR may serve to redefine and broaden the spectrum of reported imaging abnormalities in pediatric patients.\r"

Lacunar infarcts were imaged by CT in 11 patients; however, no lesions were identified on CT that were not detected with MR. Presumed lacunar infarcts were identified on MR images in 17 additional patients. Lacunae generally appeared as focal areas of decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and as focal areas of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. T2-weighted MR images detected a greater number of lacunar infarcts than did mixed T1-/T2-weighted images, which in turn detected more lacunae than did T1-weighted images. In general, acute lacunar infarcts (within 1 week of onset or recurrence of clinical symptoms) were seen only on T2-weighted images, while chronic lesions (more than 1 week) were seen on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Our results indicate that MR is superior to CT for evaluating lacunar infarcts, and second, that T2-weighted images are more sensitive than T1- and mixed T1-/T2-weighted images for detecting lacunar infarcts.\r"

Our clinical-radiologic-pathologic correlation suggested that, especially in the early stages of the disease, CT and MR were relatively insensitive in detecting the primary changes of HIV encephalitis. The multiple bilateral diffuse microscopic glial nodules with multinucleated giant cells of HIV found at autopsy in both gray and white matter were usually not directly visualized by either CT or MR. Secondary, nonspecific changes, however, were seen. These included cortical atrophy, found in virtually all patients with HIV encephalitis, and HIV-induced foci of demyelination found in the minority of cases. On CT the latter were seen in the white matter as nonenhancing, nonmass-producing areas of low density; on MR they were seen as frequently progressive high-intensity signal abnormalities on T2-weighted images, usually in the periventricular white matter and centrum semiovale. MR was more sensitive in detecting these demyelinative lesions than was CT. The clinical diagnosis of HIV encephalitis usually antedated the radiographic diagnosis. In HIV meningitis, contrast CT was more definitive than MR, showing striking enhancement of the subarachnoid spaces, although MR was more sensitive in detecting the secondary parenchymal changes.\r"

Many metallic biomedical implants are composed of nonferromagnetic materials and do not present a danger to patients during MR imaging. Therefore, to evaluate the ferromagnetic qualities of 36 different metallic biomedical implants (four aneurysm clips, six hemostatic clips, four dental implants, seven prosthetic heart valves, eight orthopedic prostheses, one artificial urinary sphincter, three contraceptive diaphragms, and three cerebral ventricular shunt tube connectors) not previously evaluated with a high-field-strength MR system, we measured deflection forces at the portal of the magnet of a 1.5-T MR system. Fourteen of the 36 metallic biomedical implants were determined to be ferromagnetic as indicated by their deflection in the static magnetic field. However, only the four aneurysm clips (Drake, Mayfield, McFadden, and Sundt-Kees) had sufficient ferromagnetism to warrant exclusion of patients with these implants from imaging with a 1.5-T MR system because of the possibility of movement or displacement. The calculated deflection forces for these aneurysm clips were comparable with previously reported values of certain aneurysm clips that have been designated to present a risk for patients undergoing MR imaging. Patients with 32 of 36 metallic biomedical implants tested can be safely imaged with high-field-strength MR systems.\r"

PE was found during either procedure in 77% of patients and was marked in 29%. Symptoms of postpericardiotomy syndrome (p less than 0.05), pericardial friction rub (p less than 0.01), atrial arrhythmias (p less than 0.05), cardiac enlargement (p less than 0.01), and pleural effusion (p less than 0.05) were detected more frequently in patients with PE than in those without PE. PE was not related to the type of antithrombotic therapy, the rate of coronary bypass graft occlusion, or the type of cardiac surgery. However, the use of the left internal mammary artery as a coronary bypass graft was associated with a slightly higher incidence of PE (p less than 0.05). One patient (0.7%) required surgical drainage of PE. It was concluded that PE is a common and benign finding after cardiac surgery and usually disappears without specific therapy.\r"

Oral administration of probucol, 100 mg/kg once daily for 14 days, inhibited the LPS-induced fall in serum zinc levels, suggesting inhibition of IL-1 release. Direct evidence for inhibition of IL-1 release by probucol was obtained with an ex vivo system in which, compared with controls, peritoneal macrophages from probucol-treated mice (100 mg/kg orally X 3, or 0.25% in the diet for 3 weeks) secreted 80 to 90% less IL-1 upon LPS stimulation, measured by the C3H/HeJ thymocyte proliferation assay. Inhibition of IL-1 secretion by probucol may contribute to the therapeutic effect of probucol in atherosclerosis since as little as 1 unit of recombinant IL-1 beta was found to induce proliferation of aortic smooth muscle cells. With regard to the endogenous stimulus for IL-1 secretion, oxidized LDL is a putative candidate because it is capable of stimulating peritoneal macrophages to secrete IL-1. Because oxidized LDL is involved in the transformation of macrophages to foam cells, our data on IL-1 induction by oxidized LDL and the mitogenic effect of IL-1 on aortic smooth muscle cells suggest that activated macrophages play an important role in atherogenesis.\r"

The authors have initially found that these reagents are useful in elimination of malignant lymphomas cells from human bone marrow for autologous bone marrow transplantation. In the current study, the authors have further characterized the reactivity of these antibodies in B-cell neoplasia and have analyzed the heterogeneity of antigenic expression among benign and neoplastic lymphoid cells for B-cell monoclonal antibodies. With the use of quantitative flow cytometric techniques to assess heterogeneity of antigen expression, the findings indicate that phenotypic heterogeneity within neoplasms from individual patients exists for a number of B-cell-related monoclonal antibodies, including B1, common acute lymphocyte leukemia antigen (CALLA), Ia, Ba-1, DLC-48, and LN-1. Within a given histologic class of lymphoid neoplasia, phenotypic heterogeneity was found to be a property of some individual cases and not others for all B-cell monoclonal antibodies examined. This heterogeneity was not consistently expressed in patients with similar tumors, nor was it a consistent property of a given antigen. Using cell lines derived from large cell lymphomas, the authors were able to find phenotypic heterogeneity within neoplastic cell lines that can be used to develop models for dealing with phenotypic heterogeneity in the context of complement-mediated cell lysis. They also established that for DLC-48 and LN-1, the heterogeneity was not related to the phase of the cell cycle of the proliferating cells. The results suggest that single monoclonal antibody treatment for bone marrow depletion of neoplastic cell may be insufficient to overcome phenotypic heterogeneity of B-cell neoplasms.\r"

According to their corticotropin-releasing factor-corticotropin-cortisol (CAC) axis function as evaluated by basal plasma cortisol levels and the response of cortisol to insulin hypoglycemia and to corticotropin-releasing factor, the patients were divided into three groups: group 1 (n = 25), patients with multiple hypothalamic and/or pituitary hormone deficiencies with normal CAC axis; group 2 (n = 38), patients with partial CAC deficiency without cortisol replacement therapy (hydrocortisone); and group 3 (n = 9), patients with CAC deficiency receiving hydrocortisone therapy (5 to 10 mg/d). Repeated CAC axis evaluation in patients of group 2 over years revealed a progressive decrease in the basal and stimulated cortisol levels with age and pubertal advancement. Despite the low cortisol levels and the low cortisol response to insulin hypoglycemia, these patients did not have clinical symptoms until the end of puberty when nine of 24 patients complained of abdominal pain, weakness, or anorexia. Linear growth, which was followed up in all patients at regular intervals, showed a lower growth velocity and irregular growth in response to somatotropin treatment in the patients receiving low doses of hydrocortisone (group 3 patients when compared with group 2 patients not receiving hydrocortisone).\r"

The purposes of this investigation were to determine the prevalence of neutralizing activity in a referral population of women with a gynecologic malignancy and to determine whether the level of neutralizing activity is related either to histology or stage or whether it is affected by treatment. One hundred thirty-eight patients were studied over a 1-year interval; 121 had a documented malignancy, 16 were healthy, and one had a benign ovarian neoplasm. The mean heparin neutralizing activity in the healthy patients was 4.5% +/- 7% and it was 46.2% +/- 26% in the group with malignancy (p less than 0.0000, two-tailed). Seventy-five percent of all patients with malignancy had neutralizing activity greater than 25%. The percent of staged, untreated patients with neutralizing activity increased significantly with advancing stage (from 59% with stage I to 85% with stages III and IV disease). There was no significant relationship between neutralizing activity and histology, site of origin, or patient weight. In 10 patients in whom the disease outcome was clear, the change in neutralizing activity reflected (or predicted) the response to therapy. We conclude that heparin neutralizing activity is a generalized phenomenon in women with one of the malignancies studied, and it may potentially be useful in the evaluation of the patient's response to therapy.\r"

The lymphoma arises in the intestine, where it may remain localized, although eventual dissemination is the rule. Intraepithelial tumour cells often are seen at the mucosal tumor margin. These features suggest that EATCL may be a tumor of intraepithelial lymphocytes. A monoclonal antibody (HML-1) has been produced recently that recognizes the entire intraepithelial lymphocyte population and 50% of lamina propria T cells but very few cells outside the mucosa. Immunocytochemistry has shown that all cases of enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma studied are HML-1 positive and all peripheral T cell lymphomas and mucosal B cell lymphomas are HML-1 negative. This suggests strongly that EATCL is a tumor of mucosal T cells, possibly the intraepithelial T cell component.\r"

To further pursue this concept, the synoviocytes from diseased rats were characterized in situ and in vitro for various parameters of \"transformation.\" The spindle-shaped synoviocytes were found throughout the synovium and were the predominant cell type at sites of invasion of bone and cartilage by synovium. They stained intensely for vimentin, a microfilament prominently expressed in immature and transformed mesenchymal cells. They stained variably for Ia antigens and did not exhibit T cell surface antigens nor did they stain with histochemical stains characteristic of monocytes or granulocytes. Electron microscopy confirmed their fibroblastlike morphology and suggested high grade metabolic activity. In primary culture, the abnormal synoviocytes were adherent, grew rapidly and did not contact inhibit. Moreover, they grew under anchorage-independent conditions. These abnormal growth characteristics were inhibited by all-trans retinoic acid. Finally, explants of the arthritic synovium formed short-lived tumorlike nodules in athymic nude mice. These observations, considered in the context of other data, support the concept that the pathologic process represents a thymic-dependent, nonmalignant, locally invasive inflammatory neoplasm.\r"

Pentamidine dosage was reduced by 30% to 50% for an absolute rise in serum creatinine of more than 88 mumol/L (1 mg/dL). SETTING: Tertiary care hospital and AIDS clinic. Patients: Thirty-six patients were treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 34 with pentamidine. Pretreatment clinical features and laboratory test results were similar in the two groups. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-six recipients of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 33 recipients of pentamidine completed therapy without crossover. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole caused a rash (44%) and anemia (39%) more frequently (P less than or equal to 0.03, whereas pentamidine caused nephrotoxicity (64%), hypotension (27%), or hypoglycemia (21%) more frequently (P less than or equal to 0.01). The (A - a)DO2 improved by greater than 1.3 kPa (10 mmHg) 8 days earlier for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole recipients (95% CI for the difference in response, -1 to 17; P = 0.04). Thirty-one (86%) patients treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 20 (61%) with pentamidine survived and were without respiratory support at completion of treatment (95% CI for the difference in response, 5% to 45%; P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: For most patients with AIDS and P. carinii pneumonia, successful treatment with a single agent is possible. Toxicity associated with the two standard treatments is rarely life-threatening and may be diminished if the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole dosage is modified by pharmacokinetic monitoring and the pentamidine dosage is reduced for nephrotoxicity. Oxygenation improved more quickly and survival was better with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\r"

DESIGN: Case series based on notifiable disease report forms and patient medical records. SETTING: Cases reported to the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services from 1981 to 1987. Patients: Sixty-two patients with V. vulnificus infection. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The three clinical syndromes found were primary septicemia (38 patients), wound infections (17 patients), and gastrointestinal illness without septicemia or wound infections (7 patients). Mortality rate was highest for patients with primary septicemia (55%; 95% CI, 38 to 71) and intermediate for wound infections (24%; 95% CI, 8 to 51): no deaths occurred in those with gastrointestinal illness. Common characteristics and exposures in patients with these syndromes included recent history of raw oyster consumption for primary septicemia and gastrointestinal illness, liver disease for primary septicemia, and either having a preexisting wound or sustaining a wound in contact with seawater for wound infections. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should ask about marine exposures in patients with underlying medical conditions, especially liver disease, who present with unexplained febrile illness, and should start appropriate therapy promptly.\r"

While 11 (73%) of 15 untreated control animals had P. carinii pneumonia after 10 weeks of immunosuppression, none of the animals given 125 mg of dapsone per kg daily, weekly, biweekly, or monthly had evidence of infection. Of the 10 rats given a single dose of dapsone 23 and 50 days after immunosuppression was started, 5 (50%) had P. carinii pneumonia. When three drugs were given separately to groups of 10 rats in single doses biweekly, P. carinii pneumonia occurred in 40% of those treated with TMP-SMZ and in none of those treated with TMP-dapsone; although only 2 of those treated with pentamidine survived for evaluation, both had P. carinii pneumonia. The experiments showed that dapsone is highly effective in chemoprophylaxis for P. carinii pneumonia when given at monthly intervals or more frequently and that dapsone and TMP-dapsone are more effective than is TMP-SMZ when given at biweekly intervals. It seems reasonable to expect that biweekly doses of dapsone or TMP-dapsone would provide an effective and reasonably safe chemoprophylaxis regimen for patients at high risk for P. carinii pneumonia, and studies to test such a scheme are justifiable. Biweekly doses are preferred over monthly doses to allow for occasional inadvertent omission of doses expected from patients.\r"

Ninety percent of beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited at a concentration 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it was less active against Branhamella spp. It did not inhibit (MIC, greater than 16 micrograms/ml) enterococci, viridans group streptococci, or methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The MICs of R-3746 for 90% of strains tested for Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Citrobacter diversus; Proteus mirabilis; and Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia spp. were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. It was two- to eightfold less active than cefixime but was markedly superior to cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. R-3746 inhibited 50% of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella spp., Providencia spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas spp. were resistant. Fifty percent of Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but MICs for Bacteroides spp. were greater than 128 micrograms/ml.

We also studied the Diff-Quik stain in combination with (4) toluidine blue and (5) silver methenamine. The three stains were comparable for screening purposes. Each disclosed similar numbers of P carinii aggregates on similarly prepared slides. Cysts were difficult to recognize on Diff-Quik due to the negatively staining character of the cyst wall with this stain. The cyst-wall stains, toluidine blue and silver methenamine, clearly stained the cyst wall. The combination of a cyst-wall stain with Diff-Quik allowed visualization of cysts, highlighted by the cyst-wall stain, and aggregate area, delineated by the Diff-Quik, allowing expression of number of cysts per aggregate area, a measure termed cyst density.\r"

Prompted by reports of elevated corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and reduced 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with major depression, these CSF constituents were examined in 56 nonmedicated patients who were in the early stages of HD. Elevated CRF concentrations were found in patients with HD in comparison with a control group of 21 subjects without neurologic illness. The CSF 5-HIAA concentrations in patients with HD did not differ from that in four normal volunteers. Patients with HD who had depressive disorders (major depression or dysthymia) did not differ from those without depression with respect to CSF 5-HIAA or CRF concentration. However, a positive correlation was observed between severity of major depression and CRF concentration. These findings suggest that the depression associated with HD may differ neurochemically from that seen in other major depressive disorders, and support the notion that clinically significant depressive symptoms reflect heterogeneous pathophysiologic conditions with different neurochemical correlates.\r"

Deficiency in PHA-stimulated IL-2 production by cells from SLE patients was repaired by the addition of PMA, but not ionomycin. PMA alone did not stimulate IL-2 production but, in concert with PHA, induced IL-2 synthesis. Moreover, PMA was effective in the repair of the deficiency of PHA-induced IL-2 production by both T4+ and T8+ subsets. Thus, for effective IL-2 production, SLE T cells required signals either distinct from or in addition to those supplied by PHA.\r"

Western blot analysis best showed the appearance of antibodies to nucleocapsid proteins, and antibodies to higher molecular weight envelope glycoproteins were better demonstrated by radioimmunoprecipitation. With whole HIV, antibodies to p24 appeared first, and sometimes were the only ones to be demonstrable. Several immunizations with HIV or recombinant polypeptides were required to obtain antibodies to gp120, and the responses were weak. Although the envelope-specific response was weak, this was the only component that mediated neutralizing capacity. Escherichia coli-derived viral transmembrane polypeptide (g)p41 also had a poor immunizing effect. IgG synthesis from B cells in vitro was demonstrable to antigens and generally paralleled the antibody titers of sera after multiple immunizations. The HIV-specific lymphocyte proliferation response as measured by DNA synthesis was best seen with polypeptide p24-15, followed by the other antigens.\r"

Fifteen patients presented with moderate to severe disease and visual acuities from counting fingers to light perception, while two had acuities of 20/60 and 20/200. A final visual outcome of 20/70 or better was achieved in 13 of 17 eyes (76%). Only one eye lost perception of light secondary to retinal detachment. Therapy including vitrectomy is an effective means of controlling moderate to severe coagulase-negative staphylococcal endophthalmitis and restoring vision.\r"

There was no significant difference in the tear alpha 1-antitrypsin and serum albumin levels in viral isolation-positive and isolation-negative patients. The raised levels of the two proteins in tears may reflect conjunctival inflammation rather than infection, since both isolation-positive and isolation-negative patients had the raised levels.

  ".W": "Thirteen patients with recurrent glioblastoma were treated with adoptively transferred autologous lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells and recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2). Patients' blood mononuclear cells (MNC) obtained by leukapheresis were cultured at 2.5 million MNC per ml for 3 to 5 days in media containing 1000 U rIL-2/ml. After incubation, the nonadherent MNC from all cultures (0.5-5 X 10(9] were combined and concentrated for infusion in 5 to 10 ml saline containing 10(6) U rIL-2. Nine patients received one injection of LAK cells and rIL-2 into the brain tissue immediately surrounding the tumor cavity during craniotomy for subtotal tumor removal (Group 1). On each of the 3 days after surgery, patients received boosters of 10(6) U rIL-2 delivered into the tumor cavity through a skin flap or via an Ommaya reservoir. Approximately 1 to 2 weeks after this series of injections, these patients were treated with a second cycle of LAK cells and rIL-2 injected into the tumor cavity using the reservoir. Four patients received both adoptive immunotherapy cycles by intracavitary injection (Group 2). In this relatively small patient pool, neither age, sex, Karnofsky score, treatment history, nor anticonvulsant and steroid dosage appeared to influence a patient's ability to make LAK cells. The therapy, itself, was well-tolerated by all patients although they all displayed symptoms of aseptic meningitis and increased intracranial pressure, i.e., headache, fever, malaise on the days of LAK cell and/or rIL-2 infusion. The therapy did not appear to have a significant impact on patient survival (mean, 30 weeks) especially for those patients with a high postsurgical tumor burden. As the therapy is safe, the authors believe its efficacy can best be tested in patients with a newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma which lies in an area where a near-total resection is possible.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LG) and polymorphic reticulosis (PR), originally described as distinct entities, now are considered as a single disease process. Common histopathologic features include necrosis, vasculitis, and a granulomatous infiltrate. Such features have led to consider lymphomatoid granulomatosis as a systemic vasculitis; alternatively the possible emergence of an overt lymphoma has suggested that it could be a lymphoproliferative process. To investigate this later hypothesis, the authors analyzed the cellular infiltrate of tissue specimens from two patients with histologic features of LG. The analysis included the study of T-cell antigen expression and DNA rearrangement of the beta T-cell receptor gene. In one patient, the T-cell phenotype of infiltrating cells was abnormal because of antigen loss. In both patients, the cells contained rearranged DNA indicating the presence of a clonal T-cell proliferation. It is concluded that some cases of LG and PR, if not all, are related to a neoplastic T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.\r"

All patients suffered from severe chest pain, and the electrocardiogram showed signs of acute transmural ischemia. A reperfusion catheter manufactured by Advanced Cardiovascular Systems (ACS) has 36 side holes spirally arranged along the distal 10 cm. It is introduced over an exchange wire. After the catheter was positioned across the occlusion, five patients had complete relief of chest pain, and another patient had partial relief. The electrocardiogram normalized in all six patients (in one only initially). Two patients developed a limited myocardial infarction, but four did not. The time between introduction of the reperfusion catheter and aorta cross clamping varied between 1.5 and 6.5 hours, and there were no complications related to its use. We conclude that the ACS reperfusion catheter is useful in re-establishing coronary blood flow after failed angioplasty and prior to emergency coronary artery bypass surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Epicardial human coronary arteries (HCA) were obtained during heart transplantation. Strip preparations were mounted for isometric tension recording. Tension was induced with prostaglandin F2 alpha (0.3-3 microM). Aggregating human platelets (10(7)/ml and 10(8)/ml) caused marked relaxation if the endothelium of the HCA was intact, but produced modest additional constriction if the endothelium was removed. The endothelium-dependent relaxations to platelets were slightly enhanced in the presence of methysergide (1 microM) or after treatment of the platelets with the thromboxane synthase inhibitor dazmegrel (1 mM, 30 minutes). Relaxations to platelets were markedly inhibited or abolished in the presence of apyrase (1 unit/ml), after selective pretreatment of HCA with gossypol or methylene blue (both 30 microM, 30 minutes), or after addition of hemoglobin (20 microM) to the organ bath. Pretreatment of HCA (not the platelets) with aspirin (30 microM, 30 minutes) had no significant effect on platelet-induced relaxations. Adenosine 5'-diphosphate (0.1-100 microM) induced marked relaxations in endothelium-intact and much smaller relaxations in endothelium-denuded HCA. A low concentration (10 nM) of serotonin (5-HT) produced modest endothelium-dependent relaxations, higher concentrations (0.1-1 microM) led to increases in tension (also in the presence of endothelium). The thromboxane A2 mimetic U44069 (1-100 nM) was the most potent constrictor of HCA irrespective of the presence or absence of endothelium. After inhibition of thromboxane synthase, platelets produced large amounts of prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha. Both prostaglandins constricted HCA, which can explain the limited effects of dazmegrel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

TGF-beta dose-dependently inhibited DNA synthesis stimulated by both insulin-like growth factor I and epidermal growth factor but did not affect the number or affinity of receptors for the two growth factors, suggesting that TGF-beta inhibits postreceptor events responsible for initiation of DNA synthesis. TGF-beta was a potent inhibitor of iodine metabolism. When porcine thyroid cells were cultured with TSH for 3 days in the presence of TGF-beta, TSH-induced iodide uptake and organification were reduced at rates that were dependent on the TGF-beta concentrations. The inhibition was detectable at TGF-beta concentrations as low as 50 pg/ml, and complete suppression was seen at 1 ng/ml. Only 6 h of exposure to TGF-beta resulted in a significant inhibition of TSH-induced iodine metabolism. Treatment of thyroid cells with TGF-beta for 3 days did not reduce cAMP production stimulated by TSH. Moreover, the intracellular cAMP level of thyroid cells cultured with TSH plus TGF-beta did not differ from that of cells cultured with TSH alone. TGF-beta decreased iodide uptake stimulated by forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP. These results strongly suggest that TGF-beta inhibits TSH-stimulated iodine metabolism, at least in part, by affecting events subsequent to cAMP production. The physiological role of TGF-beta remains to be determined, but it may be involved in the regulation of thyroid cell growth and function.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma ACTH, arginine vasopressin (AVP), and alpha MSH were measured in pituitary venous effluent at 5-min intervals from five unanesthetized horses during cortisol infusion and after an iv bolus of AVP or ovine (o) CRF. In control experiments (no hormone) there was a significant overall correlation between the timing of concentration changes in ACTH and alpha MSH. Cortisol infusion increased jugular cortisol levels by 70% and was associated with a reduction in mean ACTH, AVP, and alpha MSH secretion rates and ACTH peak secretion rate, but did not alter the observed pulse frequencies of these hormones. Administration of AVP raised plasma concentrations to a level comparable to the spontaneous peaks in pituitary venous blood and resulted in an increase in the secretion of ACTH and alpha MSH in all horses. Furthermore, spontaneous AVP peaks occurred in pituitary venous blood between 90 and 180 min after AVP injection, indicating that the exogenous hormone did not suppress AVP secretion. oCRF administration led to a prolonged elevation in plasma CRF and an increase in secretion of ACTH and alpha MSH, but not AVP, in all horses. The pulsatile secretion of ACTH and alpha MSH was maintained despite plasma CRF levels in excess of 400 pmol/liter, and the timing of concentration changes in AVP and ACTH continued to be highly correlated. It is concluded that pulsatile ACTH secretion continues during cortisol, oCRF, or AVP administration. Like that of ACTH, alpha MSH secretion is stimulated by oCRF and AVP administration and suppressed by cortisol. Although the timing of concentration changes in ACTH and alpha MSH is highly correlated, the correlation of the actual concentrations of these two hormones varies considerably in different animals.\r"

Specific binding sites were observed on a cell profile enriched in endocytic components, including lysosome-like structures, a rough endoplasmic reticulum-rich cell profile, and a cell profile that histologically resembles an undifferentiated precursor cell. By the criteria of gel filtration and precipitability by trichloroacetic acid, most of the bound [125I]iodo-EGF was considered intact. By morphological criteria none of the cell profiles that bound [125I]iodo-EGF corresponded to fully formed osteoclasts or osteoblasts. The endocytic cell was found in the epiphyseal plate between the invading capillary and the transverse and longitudinal cartilage septa as well as near osteoclasts in the zone of mixed spicules. The rough endoplasmic reticulum-rich cell was present in vacated chondrocyte lacunae of the epiphyseal plate close to the metaphysis, and the poorly differentiated cell was observed between the mixed spicules of the metaphysis. Similar cell types were also found in the alveolar bone surrounding the incisors. These cells may be the origin of established bone cell lines that harbor high concentrations of EGF receptors and may also be responsible for the humoral hypercalcemia in response to the reported actions of injected EGF or transforming growth factor-alpha as well as that of malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) regulate hormone production in several endocrine cells cultures. We have previously found that 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a protein kinase C activator, potentiates the cAMP-mediated secretion of human CB (hCG) in cultured human choriocarcinoma cells. We have now studied whether EGF and IGF-I modify cAMP-mediated hCG secretion in JEG-3 cells, which possess high affinity receptors to these growth factors. EGF, TPA, and cholera toxin (CT), an activator of adenylate cyclase, stimulated the secretion of hCG in a concentration-dependent manner during a 24-h culture period. The maximal effective concentrations of EGF (10 ng/ml), TPA (10 ng/ml), and CT (1.0 ng/ml) exerted 2.3-, 2.4-, and 3.9-fold increase over unstimulated level, respectively. EGF and TPA potentiated the effect of CT on hCG secretion from 3.9- to 7.8-fold and from 3.9- to 14.8-fold, respectively. By contrast, IGF-I was ineffective. During a 24-h culture, EGF and TPA potentiated the effect of CT on cAMP accumulation 1.4-fold and 1.3-fold over the production of CT-treated cells. Time-course studies indicated that these effects on cAMP and hCG were detectable at 3 h and 6 h, and they continued to increase up to 48 h and 72 h, respectively. When added alone, EGF and TPA increased cAMP production y 2.0-fold and 2.5-fold over controls at 24 h. Again, IGF-I was ineffective. Moreover, EGF and TPA potentiated the effect of 8-bromo-cAMP (on hCG production to a similar extent than they did to CT-stimulated hCG production. The binding of [125I]iodo-EGF to the cells was not altered by a 48-h CT-treatment whereas the binding of [125I]iodo-IGF-I was increased by 2.1-fold above untreated cells. Our data show that both EGF and TPA potentiated the effect of CT on hCG secretion in JEG-3 cells, whereas IGF-I had no effect. Although EGF and TPA facilitated CT-stimulated cAMP accumulation, their site of action on cAMP-mediated hCG production is distinct from the adenylate cyclase or EGF-receptor level since EGF and TPA potentiated the hCG secretion stimulated by 8-bromo-cAMP and an increase in cAMP production did not alter the binding properties of EGF-receptor.\r"

The present study examines androgen binding and metabolism in regions of the cerebral cortex and several subcortical structures at different time points during the development of the rhesus monkey. Androgen binding and metabolism were assessed in selected cortical and subcortical regions from neonatal, juvenile, and adult rhesus monkeys. Specific high affinity androgen-binding sites (apparent equilibrium dissociation constants for [3H]R1881, 0.04-0.3 nM) were observed in many areas of the rhesus monkey brain. These areas included (but were not limited to) the hypothalamus, amygdala, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbital prefrontal cortex, visual and somatosensory cortex, and corpus callosum. Although the highest level of androgen binding was observed in the hypothalamus (8-20 fmol/mg protein), cortical samples also had measurable levels of binding (1-5 fmol/mg protein). No apparent regional or developmental differences in the number or affinity of androgen-binding sites were detected in animals ranging from 1 week to 8 yr in age. Androgen metabolism via aromatization and 5 alpha-reduction was observed in all regions of the neocortex examined, although at lower levels than in the hypothalamus and amygdala. Overall production of estrogens and 5 alpha-reduced androgens declined approximately 10-fold from prenatal to early postnatal life in both cortical and subcortical structures. The presence of androgen binding and metabolism in the monkey cerebral cortex indicates that steroid hormones may have considerable impact on cortical function in primates at postnatal as well as prenatal ages.\r"

  ".W": "Colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS; De-Nol) exhibits gastroprotective properties in experimental animals and enhances the healing of chronic gastroduodenal ulcers, but the mechanisms of these actions have not been entirely elucidated. The present study was designed to determine whether epidermal growth factor (EGF), which also has gastroprotective and ulcer healing properties, contributes to the action of De-Nol on the stomach in rats. It was found that De-Nol protects the gastric mucosa against ethanol damage and that this is accompanied by increased mucosal generation of prostaglandins (PG). Removal of the endogenous source of EGF (sialoadenectomy) did not significantly decrease the protective and PG stimulating effects of De-Nol. Pretreatment with exogenous EGF partially protected the stomach against ethanol injury, but did not influence the protective action of De-Nol in sialoadenectomised animals. De-Nol, like EGF given orally, enhanced the healing of chronic gastric and duodenal ulcers induced by serosal acetic acid. De-Nol was found to bind EGF in a pH-dependent manner and to accumulate it in ulcer area. Thus the peptide is available locally in high concentrations to accelerate the re-epithelialisation and tissue repair of the ulcerated mucosa. These ulcer healing effects of De-Nol were reduced by sialoadenectomy and restored in part by oral administration of EGF. We conclude that salivary glands in rats are not essential for the gastroprotection induced by De-Nol, but seem to play an important role in the ulcer healing action of this drug possibly via an EGF mediated mechanism.\r"

Luminal sucralfate (0.5 g/l) significantly increased bicarbonate secretion by fundic and antral mucosa without influencing transmucosal potential difference. Significant stimulation of duodenal bicarbonate secretion occurred only at 1.0 g/l without change in potential difference. Aluminium, a component of sucralfate, produced similar increases in bicarbonate secretion, while the sucrose and sulphate components were without effect. Pretreatment of mucosae with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10 5M) did not abolish the secretory response to sucralfate or aluminium. The results suggest that stimulation of gastroduodenal bicarbonate secretion, possibly by the aluminium moiety of sucralfate, may play a role in its protective and ulcer healing actions.\r"

We used beta 1 cDNA probes, derived from beta Fc gamma R gene transcripts which encode murine Fc gamma RII molecules. We found that all CCGG sequences detected with these probes were methylated in the genomic DNA of the Fc gamma RII-(-) cells. By contrast, two CCGG sites were found to be selectively unmethylated in the DNA of all Fc gamma RII(+) cells tested. These sites could be assigned to the region of the 5' end of the beta Fc gamma R gene. Besides, the treatment of Fc gamma RII(-) thymoma cells BW5147 with 5-azacytidine induced a hypomethylation of the beta Fc gamma R gene concomitantly with the transcription of that gene as seen by Northern blotting and the expression of functional Fc gamma RII. Conversely, the DNA-methylating agent ethyl methanesulfonate completely reversed the phenotype of the 5-azacytidine-treated cells to that of the Fc gamma RII(-) BW5147 parent cells. In ethyl methanesulfonate-treated cells, the beta Fc gamma R gene was remethylated and the corresponding transcript was no more detectable. We conclude that the methylation of a specific 5' segment of the beta Fc gamma R gene regulates the expression of Fc gamma RII in murine T cells, B cells, mast cells, and macrophages, possibly by controlling the gene transcription.\r"

  ".U": "88285663\r", 
  ".W": "The adoptive transfer of specifically sensitized T lymphocytes can effectively mediate the regression of established local and metastatic tumors. Previous experiments using the weakly immunogenic MCA 105 sarcoma indicated that cellular interactions between transferred L3T4+ helper and Lyt-2+ cytotoxic immune T cells were necessary for mediating tumor regression. In this study, the kinetics of T-T cell interactions were analyzed by in vivo depletion of T cell subsets with mAb. The anti-tumor efficacy of transferred immune cells was abrogated by in vivo administration of either L3T4 or Lyt-2 mAb on the day of cellular therapy. However, if mAb were given 3 days after the transfer of immune cells, depletion of Lyt-2+ but not L3T4+ cells abrogated anti-tumor efficacy. T cell depletion on day 6 after transfer of immune cells had no adverse effect on tumor regression, indicating the period required for T cell reactivity in vivo. Furthermore, depletion of Ia+ cells by in vivo mAb treatment abrogated the anti-tumor efficacy of immune cells. It is thus hypothesized that there are two distinct but sequential phases of in vivo T cell interactions leading to the regression of established tumors after adoptive immunotherapy. An initial \"helper/inducer\" phase apparently requires the interaction of L3T4+ immune cells and the tumor Ag involving Ia+ cells. The inducement of L3T4+ cell activation is to provide helper function via the secretion of IL-2. The second phase designated as an \"effector phase\" involves differentiation of immune Lyt-2+ cells under the influence of IL-2 secreted during the helper/inducer phase for generation of mature Lyt-2+ effector cells. To further support the hypothesis of a two-phase process we have examined the phenotype and kinetics of tumor regression mediated by effector cells generated by secondary in vitro sensitization (IVS). Although the IVS cells were generated from fresh MCA 105 immune spleen cells, their anti-tumor efficacy was mediated solely by Lyt-2+ lymphocytes. Kinetic studies revealed that the in vivo requirement of IVS Lyt-2+ effector cells to mediate tumor regression was less than 3 days, and the anti-tumor reactivity of these cells was not affected by in vivo depletion of Ia+ cells. Thus, the IVS reaction is likely representative of the in vivo counterpart of the helper/inducer phase leading to the generation of mature Lyt-2+ immune effector cells. Tumor regression after transfer of Lyt-2+ cells generated in IVS therefore required a relatively shorter period of time than that required after the transfer of fresh noncultured MCA 105 immune spleen cells.\r"

  ".U": "88285665\r", 
  ".W": "In these studies we utilized the Ag (SRBC)-reactive B cell line CH12LX to study isotype switching. CH12LX cells are a stable population of B cells mainly bearing membrane IgM (mIgM) (98 to 99%) with a small population of B cells bearing membrane IgA (mIgA) (1 to 2%). LPS induced a 5- to 10-fold increase in the secretion of both Ig, whereas a lymphokine-rich supernatant of D10 T cells induced a greater increase in the secretion of IgA than IgM. Analysis of the latter effect with recombinant lymphokines disclosed that rIL-4 induced an increase in the number of mIgA+ cells (6 to 15%) with minimal effect on IgA secretion, whereas IL-5 induced increased IgA secretion but had no effect on mIgA expression. The addition of both lymphokines induced increased mIgA expression and IgA secretion. No effect on mIgA expression or IgA secretion was seen with other lymphokines, including IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, GM-CSF, and IFN-gamma. The rIL-4 effect on CH12LX cells represents true differentiation rather than selective proliferation for the following reasons: first, subclones of CH12LX cells respond to IL-4-containing T cell supernatant in the same fashion as the original cell line; second, culture of CH12LX cells with IL-4 causes the appearance of large numbers of dual-bearing mIgM/mIgA cells as well as mIgA+ cells and a dual-bearing mIgM/mIgA line was obtained by cloning CH12LX after stimulation with an IL-4-containing supernatant; third, sorted mIgA+ and mIgA- CH12LX cells had similar rates of proliferation in the presence or absence of IL-4. In further studies, it was found that IL-5 causes IgA secretion by mIgA+ but not mIgA- CH12LX cells indicating that it is acting as a post-isotype switch differentiation factor. These studies are consistent with the view that IL-4 and IL-5 act in a sequential fashion to induce IgA expression and secretion in CH12LX cells, IL-4 inducing differentiation of mIgM+ cells to mIgA+ cells and IL-5 enhancing the IgA secretion by the resulting mIgA-bearing cells.\r"

  ".W": "The present study investigates the distinctiveness of Class I H-2 alloantigen-reactive Lyt-2+ helper/proliferative T cell subset in the aspect of tolerance induction. Primary mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) revealed that Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ T cell subsets from C57BL/6 (B6) mice were exclusively capable of responding to class I H-2 [B6-C-H-2bm1 (bm1)]- and class II H-2 [B6-C-H-2bm12 (bm12)]-alloantigens, respectively. Anti-bm12 MLR was not affected by i.v. injection of bm12 spleen cells into recipient B6 mice. In contrast, a single i.v. administration of bm1 spleen cells into B6 mice resulted in the abrogation of the capacity of recipient B6 spleen and lymph node cells to give anti-bm1 MLR. This suppression was bm1 alloantigen-specific, since lymphoid cells from B6 mice i.v. presensitized with bm1 cells exhibited comparable anti-bm12 primary MLR to that obtained by normal B6 lymphoid cells. Such tolerance was rapidly (24 h after the i.v. injection of bm1 cells) inducible and lasting for at shortest 3 wk. Addition of lymphoid cells from anti-bm1-tolerant B6 mice to cultures of normal B6 lymphoid cells did not suppress the proliferative responses of the latter cells, indicating that the tolerance is not due to the induction of suppressor cells but attributed to the elimination or functional impairment of anti-bm1 proliferative clones. The tolerance was also demonstrated by the failure of tolerant lymphoid cells to produce IL-2. It was, however, found that anti-bm1 CTL responses were generated by tolerant lymphoid cells which were unable to induce the anti-bm1 MLR nor to produce detectable level of IL-2. These results demonstrate that class I H-2 alloantigen-reactive Lyt-2+ Th cell subset exhibits a distinct property which is expressed by neither Lyt-2+ CTL directed to class I H-2 nor L3T4+ Th cells to class II H-2 alloantigens.\r"

  ".W": "This study showed that a mAb (145-2C11) against the T3 epsilon-chain of the TCR complex augmented the cytotoxic activity of the lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) effectors. The LAK cells were induced by culturing normal spleen cells with purified human rIL-2. Adding alpha T3 at the effector phase of the cytotoxic reactions augmented the LAK-mediated cytotoxicity. The alpha T3-augmented LAK killing was seen only with tumor targets, and there was no increase of killing against Con A-induced lymphoblasts. The augmentation effect was dose dependent on both the amounts of alpha T3 and the number of LAK cells added. A very low concentration of alpha T3 (1/10,000 dilution of culture supernatants) was sufficient to induce alpha T3-augmented LAK-mediated cytotoxicity. Human rIL-2 at 10 to 30 U/ml was sufficient to generate LAK cells for maximal alpha T3 augmentation, whereas 300 to 1000 U/ml of IL-2 were needed to generate maximal LAK activity when tested in the absence of alpha T3. LAK cells generated for longer periods of time showed a progressive increase of alpha T3-augmented cytotoxicity. For some targets, the alpha T3-augmented LAK killing was FcR dependent as evidenced by the ability of alpha FcR mAb 2.4G2 to inhibit, and for others it was not inhibited. The alpha T3-augmented killing did not correlate with the FcR expression on target cells as defined by 2.4G2. The LAK cells were both Lyt-2+ and Lyt-2-, but the LAK cells involved in alpha T3-augmented killing were exclusively Lyt-2+. Preincubation of LAK cells with alpha T3, but not preincubation of targets with alpha T3, resulted in augmented killing suggesting that the alpha T3 effect was unrelated to an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Our findings indicate that alpha T3 is a potent reagent to augment the cytotoxic reaction of LAK cells. These results suggested that a relationship might exist between the T3 complex and the cytotoxic activity of a subpopulation of Lyt-2+ LAK cells.\r"

  ".U": "88285671\r", 
  ".W": "A profound state of specific tolerance for the contact sensitivity reaction can be produced by i.v. exposure to hapten on the surface of syngeneic macrophages. When the same haptenated cells are incubated with specific antibody to form cell-bound Ag-antibody complexes, i.v. injection induces immunity rather than tolerance. We observe that such cell-bound Ag-antibody complexes induce not only effector cells for contact sensitivity but also hapten-specific contrasuppressor T (Tcs) cells, which are capable of rendering effector cells resistant to the inhibitory effects of Ts cells. Whereas the induction of the effector cells of contact sensitivity by cell-bound complexes required I region compatibility between the injected cells and the recipient, the induction of Tcs cells showed no genetic restriction. On the other hand, induction of contrasuppression required intact Fc on the complexed antibody, inasmuch as F(ab')2 fragments of specific antibody did not induce immunity. In addition, Tcs cells could also be induced by Ag-antibody complexes on opsonized TNP-mouse RBC treated with anti-TNP antibody. Immunity induced by cell-bound Ag-antibody complexes was observed only when antibodies of the IgM, IgG3, or IgG1 isotypes are used to generate the complexes. Further studies demonstrated that the Tcs cells induced in this way displayed the phenotype of Tcs cells described in other systems (Lyt-1+,2- I-J+, Vicia villosa lectin-adherent) and released a hapten-specific contrasuppressor factor. These studies indicate that Tcs cells can be induced independently of other T cells (such as the effector cells of contact sensitivity) and are likely to be responsible for some of the immunoregulatory effects of cell-bound Ag-antibody complexes. The role of antibody isotype in the induction of Tcs cells is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The influence that the isotype of Ag-specific antibody has on the induction of contact hypersensitivity (CS) has been investigated. Injection (i.v.) of mice with haptenated peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) pretreated with anti-hapten mAb of the IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes results in the activation of Ag-specific afferent acting Ts cells (Ts-aff). These suppressor cells are not generated when animals are injected with anti-hapten antibodies of other isotypes. The Ts-aff cells function to inhibit the generation of CS responses when injected into naive animals. Suppression is due to the induction of both Lyt-1+,2- I-J+ and Lyt-1-,2+ I-J+ T cells, both of which adhere to the lectin Vicia villosa. Attachment of both TNP and 4-ethoxymethylene-2-phenyloxazolone haptens to the same PEC, followed by treatment with an IgG2a anti-TNP antibody, generates Ts-aff cells specific for both 4-ethoxymethylene-2-phenyloxazolone and TNP. The MHC haplotype of the PEC is irrelevant, as allogeneic PEC will also induce Ts-aff cells when injected by using an identical protocol. Ts-aff cells cannot be generated in B cell-depleted mice, nor does the Ts-aff cells generated in normal mice suppress CS responses in B cell-depleted mice. These results show that Ag-antibody complexes bound on the surface of a PEC can induce potent afferent suppression in vivo. A possible general role for antibody isotypes in directing regulatory activities is discussed.\r"

In this study, we have investigated whether CTL-derived granules that exhibit lytic activity also induce DNA fragmentation in murine target cells. Cytolytic granules isolated from three different alloreactive CTL clones were tested for the induction of DNA fragmentation in P815 and EL4 target cells, by using a Triton X-100-facilitated, radiolabeled DNA release assay. In contrast to the CTL clones from which they were derived, the cytolytic granules did not induce DNA fragmentation. Agarose gel electrophoretic analysis of DNA confirmed the lack of discrete DNA fragments in target cells lysed by CTL-derived granules. Possible explanations for the difference in the ability of CTL and CTL-derived granules to trigger DNA fragmentation are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Target cell lysis by cytolyic lymphocytes follows a sequence of events that culminate in osmotic destruction of the target. Although it is clear that killer cell derived components play a crucial role in target cell lysis it is not clear to what extent the target itself is involved in its destruction. Recent observations have pointed to the possibility that glucocorticoid mediated and cell mediated lysis may utilize common pathways of cell lysis. In analyzing this question we found that cell lines that have nonfunctional glucocorticoid receptors like S49-78 and S49-88 are good targets for both NK and thymus-derived killer (TK) cells. Cell lines that are glucocorticoid sensitive such as Q1(4)6 are sensitive to NK-mediated lysis as its derivative HL4-6-3 which contains glucocorticoid receptors but is glucocorticoid resistant. An intriguing exception to this is the glucocorticoid-resistant mutant S49-4RD which is relatively resistant to both NK and TK lysis compared with parent S49. The resistance of S49-4RD to cell-mediated lysis we show here is most likely due to a defect in the target which results in its failure to trigger the cytolytic machinery in the killer cell rather than in its resistance to lysis per se. In support of this we demonstrate that lysis of S49-4RD by cytolytic granules from TK cells is normal. Moreover TK cells lyse S49-4RD as efficiently as its parent in the presence of the lectin Con A. The conclusion that S49-4RD has a defect in its ability to induce killer cells to initiate the cytolytic reaction is also in agreement with the finding that TK-S49-4RD conjugates show inefficient reorientation of the Golgi apparatus in the effector.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to examine the in vivo proinflammatory properties of IL-1, the effects of rIL-1 beta on the development of collagen-induced arthritis in mice were investigated. The results presented in this paper demonstrated that the administration of rIL-1 beta via mini-osmotic pumps into DBA/1 mice which were suboptimally immunized with native chick type II collagen (NcII) markedly accelerated the onset as well as the progression of the arthritic disease. When IL-1-containing osmotic pumps were s.c. implanted onto mice 18 days post-collagen immunization, clinical signs of arthritis appeared within 3 to 4 days after the implant with the pumps. Maximal incidence of arthritis which was usually 80 to 100% occurred between the 6th and 7th day after the administration of rIL-1 beta. Histologic analyses revealed that the knee and ankle joints from mice which were treated with rIL-1 beta for 7 days were most severely and consistently affected. Furthermore, these IL-1-treated mice exhibited granulocytic hyperplasia within the marrow as well as marked peripheral blood neutrophilia. By contrast, arthritis was not observed during the 7-day course of the IL-1 study in the following control groups: 1) mice that were only immunized with NcII, and 2) collagen-immunized mice which received osmotic pumps containing PBS. A substantial number of these collagen-immunized mice which were not treated with IL-1 eventually developed arthritis but at later times after the incidence of arthritis had peaked in the IL-1-treated group. In addition, unimmunized mice failed to develop arthritis upon treatments with IL-1 beta. Moreover, the humoral responses to NcII were not altered in the IL-1-treated mice. Thus, these in vivo studies suggest that IL-1 is potentially capable of triggering the various inflammatory events of collagen-induced arthritis, and thereby, contribute to the pathogenesis of murine arthritis.\r"

Supernatants from type 1 Th cell clones, which contain a different set of lymphokines, were not stimulatory. In the present experiments, we attempted to define the active Th2 factor(s) and to better understand the cellular basis for the hyperresponsiveness. In response to optimal concentrations of supernatant (Th2-Sup), B cells from 3-mo-old NZB/NZW mice produced up to 40-fold greater amounts of IgM anti-DNA compared with unstimulated B cells, whereas BALB/c B cells produced levels only slightly above background. Although Th2-Sup contained large amounts of IL-4, comparable concentrations of rIL-4 alone did not stimulate NZB/NZW B cells. Furthermore, a blocking anti-IL-4 mAb did not prevent Th2-Sup-stimulated autoantibody production. Th2-Sup was fractionated by HPLC, and the stimulatory factor(s) was found in fractions known to contain IL-5 (also known as B cell growth factor II). Indeed, a highly purified preparation of IL-5 reproduced the effects of Th2-Sup by stimulating NZB/NZW B cells to produce high levels of IgM anti-DNA antibodies while enhancing production by nonautoimmune cells only slightly. In limiting dilution studies, NZB/NZW compared with BALB/c spleens contained a three- to four-fold greater frequency of DNA-specific B cells that were responsive to IL-5. Together, the results suggest a potential role for IL-5 in the pathogenesis of NZB/NZW autoimmune disease.\r"

Various B cell growth factors (BCGF) have been described including a 60-kDa BCGF called high m.w. BCGF (HMW-BCGF). In this paper we describe a mAb BA5 that blocks the proliferation of normal activated human B lymphocytes in response to HMW-BCGF and does not affect the proliferation of T cells in response to PHA or IL-2. BA5 shows minimum binding to resting B cells, significantly enhanced binding to resting B cells, significantly enhanced binding to activated B cells and essentially no binding to resting or activated T cells. BA5 recognizes a 90-kDa protein from solubilized membranes of activated B cells. 125I-HMW-BCGF cross-linked to its binding site on activated B cells produces a 150-kDa R-protein complex. Unlabeled HMW-BCGF cross-linked to its binding site on activated B cells produces a 150-kDa band recognized by both BA5 and BCGF/1/C2 (a mAb to HMW-BCGF) using Western blotting. Thus, BA5 recognizes a molecule intimately associated with the receptor for HMW-BCGF which includes a binding site for HMW-BCGF. BA5 can be used to explore the role of HMW-BCGF and B cell proliferation in various aspects of human B cell physiology.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that mAb Ly-5 which on B cells recognizes a 220,000-Da (B220) molecule, inhibits LPS-induced IgG responses without affecting IgM or proliferative responses, whereas mAb Lyb-2 which modulates B cell activation processes induced by B cell stimulatory factor-1 (BSF-1) or IL-4, has no effect on LPS-induced B cell responses. In this report we further examined the cellular mechanisms of Ly-5 antibody action and the effect of Lyb-2 antibody in IgG responses induced by LPS and BSF-1. The results presented demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of Ly-5 antibody seems to be restricted to the IgG class and is observed in all IgG subclasses induced by LPS. Limiting dilution analysis showed that the Ly-5 antibody reduces primarily the precursor frequency of IgG-secreting cells and that the effect on the clone size is partial. Lyb-2 antibody, on the other hand, greatly inhibited IgG1 induction initiated by LPS and BSF-1 by the action on processes triggered by BSF-1, although it could not reverse the reduced IgG2b or IgG3 responses. Limiting dilution analysis revealed that Lyb-2 antibody reduces the precursor frequency but not the clone size of BSF-1-induced IgG1-producing cells, supporting our previous proposition that Lyb-2 plays a critical role in the B cell differentiation mediated by BSF-1. Taken together, these results indicate that both Ly-5 and Lyb-2 are important molecules in IgG subclass regulation, each acting on a distinct activation step.\r"

After transfer of the HLA-6.2 gene into a class I null human lymphoblastoid cell line, a protein associated with beta 2-microglobulin is detected. Analysis of HLA deletion mutant cell lines places the HLA-6.2 gene between the HLA-C and HLA-A loci on the short arm of chromosome 6.

The apparent activation of ODC occurs by two independent steps. Rapid activation of enzyme occurs within the first 10 min of lymphokine treatment of cloned IL-2-dependent murine cell lines. The initial rapid rise in enzyme activity is insensitive to protein or mRNA synthesis inhibitors. The early rise in ODC activity is followed by a protracted increase in enzyme activity, apparent protein measured by [3H]difluoromethylornithine binding, and by accumulation of steady state ODC mRNA. Stable analogues of cAMP which inhibit IL-2-stimulated proliferation, suppressed only the mRNA-dependent increase in ODC activity. Phorbol esters were shown to increase steady state levels of ODC mRNA whereas cAMP analogue clearly inhibited the growth factor-induced increase in ODC mRNA. These studies show that IL-2 regulates the expression of ODC at multiple levels, including transcription and accumulation of steady state mRNA, and post-translational activation of an enzyme important for DNA synthesis. Furthermore, anti-proliferative signals such as cAMP may effect the regulation of ODC enzyme production at the level of mRNA accumulation and stability.\r"

In an effort to understand the relationship between HTLV-I infection and malignant transformation, we have examined transferrin receptor expression in HTLV-I-infected cells. Transferrin receptor expression in normal T cells is tightly regulated and essential for cell proliferation. We have used matched T cell sets originating from a normal donor, consisting of tetanus toxoid-specific normal T cell clones (TM3 and TM5) and their in vitro HTLV-I-infected counterparts (TM3H and TM5H). Using these matched sets of virus-infected and normal T cells, we have determined that HTLV-I infection leads to hyperexpression of surface transferrin receptors (five- to six-fold higher than normal counterparts). Although the growth rates of the virus-infected cells did not differ significantly from their normal controls, HTLV-I-infected cells constitutively hyperexpressed surface transferrin receptors, whereas the level of surface receptor expression of normal counterpart cells varied during the cycle of antigenic stimulation. Immunoprecipitation of total (surface plus cytoplasmic) transferrin expression showed that the HTLV-I-infected cells did not possess a greater total number of transferrin receptors than their normal counterparts. This data was supported by Northern blot analysis, which showed equivalent transferrin receptor mRNA expression in HTLV-I-infected and uninfected cells. Functional analysis revealed a marked defect in 59Fe-transferrin internalization in the HTLV-I-infected cells. Furthermore, the HTLV-I-infected cells showed markedly decreased transferrin receptor phosphorylation and internalization in response to active phorbol ester. Thus the data demonstrate that in peripheral blood T cells, HTLV-I infection is accompanied by surface transferrin receptor overexpression secondary to subcellular redistribution and defective internalization.\r"

Biochemical analysis of CD3+, CD4-, CD8- splenocytes revealed that the vast majority of these cells express one of at least two distinct CD3-associated TCR gamma delta heterodimeric structures, but no detectable TCR alpha beta. One disulfide-linked heterodimer (77 kDa) is composed of two chains of 45 to 46 and 32 kDa. The latter chain was immunoprecipitated with an anti-TCR C gamma 1/C gamma 2 antiserum and was not glycosylated. An antiserum produced against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal region of the predicted C gamma 4 gene product immunoprecipitated additional heterodimers (80 to 90 kDa). One heterodimer, composed of disulfide-linked 41- to 45-kDa protein (including a V gamma/C gamma 4 component), is expressed on a T cell hybridoma, DN-1.21, which was derived from fused splenic CD3+, CD4-, CD8- T cells. Another V gamma/C gamma 4-containing heterodimer is composed of disulfide-linked 46- to 47-kDa glycoproteins. These findings demonstrate that CD3+, CD4-, CD8- T cells present in the peripheral lymphoid organs express a variety of paired TCR gamma delta proteins.

  ".W": "Recent work in both the human and murine systems has demonstrated that IL-4 is capable of specifically inducing the synthesis of the low affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RII). In addition, in conjunction with LPS, IL-4 will induce IgG1 and IgE synthesis. To analyze the correlation between Fc epsilon RII induction and IgE secretion, Fc epsilon RII and IgE levels were measured by RIA on murine splenic B cells stimulated with LPS and IL-4 over 7 days of culture. Treatment with LPS and IL-4 gave a 20- to 50-fold (day 3) \"superinduction\" of Fc epsilon RII levels compared with a 3- to 5-fold induction with IL-4 alone; removal of IL-4 resulted in a rapid decline in Fc epsilon RII levels. The cells expressing high Fc epsilon RII levels were determined to be blasts. Superinduction of Fc epsilon RII occurs at 10 U/ml IL-4 and remains relatively constant in the range of 10 to 1000 U/ml. In contrast, with increasing IL-4, IgE levels increase, reaching microgram levels at day 7 with 300 U/ml IL-4. Triggering the cells with anti-Ig, as expected, gave no Ig secretion, and in addition, Fc epsilon RII superinduction by IL-4 and anti-Ig was not seen. PMA is known to block Ig secretion induced by LPS. Concentrations of PMA that totally abrogated IgE secretion had no effect on Fc epsilon RII superinduction, indicating that the latter phenomena can be separated from IL-4-induced Ig secretion. Superinduction also results in higher levels of Fc epsilon RII fragment release into the media. Thus, attempts were made to influence IgE secretion by adding additional purified Fc epsilon RII fragment to the culture. The purified fragment did not have a significant influence on IgE levels in this system.\r"

We demonstrated that irradiated MHC class II-positive but not class II-negative 1B-6 thyrocytes stimulated CD4+ T cells in a primary sensitization reaction over 4 days. In contrast, CD8+ T cells had no response in similar experiments. This stimulation of CD4+ T cells was dose dependent for 1B-6 thyrocytes and was abrogated by anti-rat MHC class II mAb (MRC OX-6). Autoreactive (Fisher) and alloreactive (Buffalo) T cell lines and isolated CD4+ T cells derived from these lines, which were developed against Fisher rat spleen cells, similarly recognized MHC class II Ag expressed on 1B-6 cells but had no detectable response to 1B-6 MHC class II-negative thyrocytes or MHC class II-positive human thyroid cells. The CD4+ T cell recognition of 1B-6 cells via MHC class II Ag supports our previous data with autologous human thyroid T cell co-cultures and is indicative of an autospecific role for thyrocytes in the development of autoimmune thyroiditis.\r"

All in vitro growing CD3+ and CD3- clones expressed Tp103 regardless of their phenotype and the expression of a CD3-associated TCR complex. Whereas the CD2 pathway was functional in all these clones, only CD3-expressing clones could be triggered via Tp103 to kill target cells. In contrast, both CD2 and Tp103 pathways were suppressed after modulation of the TCR complex with anti-CD3 mAb. This indicates that the function of Tp103 but not of CD2 is dependent on the expression of a functional Ag receptor on cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, modulation of the Ag receptor induces a state of unresponsiveness in cytotoxic T cells that cannot be attributed to just the removal of the CD3/TCR complex from the cell membrane.\r"

  ".W": "The structure-function relationships in human class I HLA molecules have been examined by the analysis of two T cell-defined subtypes of HLA-A3 (A3.1 and A3.2). These subtypes differ by two amino acid residues that are located at positions 152 (GluA3.1 vs ValA3.2) and 156 (LeuA3.1 vs GlnA3.2). By the methods of site-directed mutagenesis and DNA-mediated gene transfer, mammalian cell transfectants have been produced that express only one of the above A3.2 amino acid residues at either position 152 or position 156. Previous studies using murine transfectants have shown that A3.1- and A3.2-expressing cells can be distinguished by A3.1-restricted type A influenza virus-specific CTL and A3.2-allospecific CTL and have implied that amino acid position 152 plays a key role in this specificity. To test whether these results were a function of the virus specificity, the alloantigen, or the cell type expressing the class I molecules, we have tested the recognition of human and murine cell transfectants by A3.1-restricted, A/JAP/305/57 and B/Ann Arbor-specific CTL and by A3.1- and A3.2-allospecific CTL. The results indicate that the Glu at position 152 is critical for recognition by all of the A3.1-restricted CTL populations tested and 15 of 16 of the A3.1-allospecific CTL populations tested. The A3.1 Leu at position 156 was sufficient for recognition by only one A3.1-allospecific CTL line. Substitution of the charged Glu residue for the polar Gln at position 156 of A3.2 affected recognition of some but not all A3.2-alloreactive CTL. These data demonstrate that the structural basis for epitopes that are recognized by almost all CTL that discriminate between A3.1 and A3.2 is primarily the amino acid at position 152. The implications of these data for Ag presentation and CTL recognition are discussed.\r"

The 7D4+ cells have predominantly nonrearranged TCR beta-chain genes and express incomplete 1.0-kb beta-messages, whereas the 7D4- cells have rearranged beta-genes and express complete 1.3-kb as well as incomplete 1.0-kb beta-messages. These two populations of double-negative thymocytes also differ in their responses to IL-2 and IL-4. The 7D4+ cells are nonresponsive to IL-2 alone or IL-2 plus PMA but they are stimulated to proliferate by the combination of IL-4 and PMA. In contrast, the 7D4- cells vigorously proliferate in response to IL-2 alone or IL-2 plus PMA but they respond poorly to IL-4 alone or IL-4 plus PMA. These results suggest that IL-2 and IL-4 may be involved in the stimulation of immature thymocytes at distinct steps of their differentiation. IL-4 together with PMA stimulate immature thymocytes which seem to express the IL-2R but do not respond to IL-2.\r"

The antibody J11d has been shown to define a differentiation Ag found on immature thymocytes but not on mature and functional peripheral CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. To analyze the possible relationship between the lpr double-negative T cells and the thymocytes, we investigated the simultaneous expression of J11d and Thy 1 Ag on the double-negative lpr lymph node cells by using two-color immunofluorescent staining technique. We observed that lpr mice at 3 to 4 weeks of age, before the onset of lymphadenopathy, did not have significant numbers (less than 4%) of J11d+ T cells in the periphery, similar to the number found in the control MRL +/+ mice. However, with increasing age of approximately 8 to 10 weeks and coinciding with the appearance of lymphadenopathy, a significant number (approximately 35%) of J11d+ Thy-1+ cells started appearing in the periphery of lpr mice and was maintained until the mice died at 20 to 24 weeks of age. The J11d+ T cells belonged to the abnormal double-negative T cell pool, inasmuch as J11d+ CD4+ or J11d+ CD8+ cells were absent in the lymph nodes of 20-wk-old lpr mice. Furthermore, 20-wk-old lpr mice demonstrated increased numbers (approximately 41%) of double-negative T cells in the thymus, a significant proportion of which were J11d+. In contrast, the 20-wk-old +/+ mice or 4-wk-old lpr mice had only 4% double-negative T cells in the thymus. The present study suggests that a significant number of peripheral double-negative T cells of lpr mice bear the immature thymic differentiation Ag J11d. The possibility that the accumulation of double-negative T cells results from abnormal peripheralization of double-negative J11d+ thymocytes, before complete differentiation into CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The primary interaction of HIV-1 with the target cell involves the viral large envelope protein (gp120) and the cellular CD4 molecule. mAb reacting with portions of CD4 have been shown to block HIV-1 attachment and infection. In one of the early reports describing HIV-1 cell interaction, some mAb reacting with MHC class II Ag were also found to block infection. To investigate further a possible role for MHC class II in HIV-1 binding, a cultured T lymphocyte cell line (H-9) that expresses MHC class II molecules and PHA-stimulated PBL was exposed for various time periods to concentrated viral particles and individual HIV-1 proteins. A decrease in the ability to detect the CD4a epitope and HLA-DR was observed after the cells were exposed to virus for 15, 30, and 60 min whereas HLA-DP and HLA-DQ Ag increased or remained unchanged. After 120 min of virus exposure, the CD4a epitope remained diminished whereas HLA-DR was detected at levels found on cells not exposed to virus. mAb detecting the CD4a epitope and HLA-DR, as well as alloantisera detecting the specific HLA-DR Ag on the target cell, blocked HIV-1 binding. When immunopurified gp120 was added to PHA-stimulated and unstimulated PBL, the CD4a epitope decreased in the same manner as was observed with whole virus preparations. In contrast to exposure to the intact virus, HLA-DR expression appeared to increase. Other viral proteins, p17, p24, and a portion of the small envelope protein, gp41, had no effect on the ability to detect cell surface Ag. Thus, although CD4 is the primary receptor for HIV-1 binding, HLA-DR appears to be involved in the binding site, probably by virtue of its close proximity to the CD4 molecule on the cell surface.\r"

Both mutant mouse strains develop a lupus-like syndrome accompanied by hyperplasia of a functionally and phenotypically abnormal T cell subset. These defective cells, which are Thy-1.2+ CD4- CD8- B220+ F23.1+, display an abundance of type l K+ channels. Phenotypically similar lymph node T cells from normal C3H-HeJ mice, or young C3H-lpr/lpr mice before the onset of disease, do not display large numbers of type l K+ channels. CD4+ CD8- T cells (helper/inducer) from the mutant mice express a small number of type n K+ channels, and CD4- CD8+ T cells (suppressor/cytotoxic) show a low level of type l or n' K+ channels, as do their phenotypically equivalent counterparts in the normal mouse thymus. These results suggest that the abundant expression of type l K+ channels is a marker for the defective lpr and gld T cell subset and may reflect the \"abnormal\" proliferative status of these cells.\r"

All three strains of mice developed experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) by active immunization with whole GPBP or by passive transfer of LNC cultured with whole GPBP. SJL (H-2s) and PL (H-2u) mice developed EAE by active immunization with fragments 89-169 or 1-37, respectively, or by passive transfer of LNC cultured with the same Ag. F1 mice developed EAE by active immunization only with fragment 1-37 or by passive transfer of LNC cultured with either of the above fragments. Removal of macrophages (MO) from immune-F1 LNC resulted in the loss of a proliferative response and the ability to transfer EAE. Reconstitution of MO-depleted immune F1 T cells with either F1-, SJL-, or PL-MO restored the proliferative responses to whole GPBP and the three fragments. Cultures of immune F1 T cells reconstituted with any of the three MO populations and incubated with whole GPBP passively transferred EAE into naive F1 mice. Immune F1 T cells cultured with F1 MO in the presence of either fragment 1-37 or 89-169 transferred EAE. F1 T cells cultured with SJL MO were able to transfer EAE only if the Ag was fragment 89-169, whereas F1 T cells cultured with PL MO were able to transfer disease only if incubated in the presence of fragment 1-37. F1 mice are passively susceptible to EAE induced by adoptive transfer of cells reactive to either the N-terminal or C-terminal fragment and that the encephalitogenic determinant of GPBP is related to the genome of MO present in vitro.\r"

All five lines proliferated and produced IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF in a dose-dependent fashion in response to HBcAg, but not to HBV envelope Ag. The cloned lines and derivative clones were HLA class II (DR1) restricted. All T cell clones were able to induce anti-HBc production by autologous B cells in response to HBcAg (helper effect). The proliferative response and the helper effect of the HBcAg-specific T cell lines and clones were augmented by co-cultivation with an autologous, autoreactive (HLA-DQ1 specific) T cell clone, even in the absence of HBcAg, and the autoreactive T cells directly stimulated anti-HBc secretion by autologous B cells, presumably due to the release of Ag-nonspecific factors.

  ".W": "It has been suggested that autoimmunity to the proteoglycan (PG) component of cartilage plays a major role in the etiology of adjuvant arthritis (AA), which occurs in rats, but not in mice, after injection of CFA. In order to more directly investigate this role, bovine and human cartilage PG were used to modulate AA, and immunity to PG was assessed. Immunization of rats or mice with PG by itself does not induce arthritis. However, in rats, a single i.v. injection of soluble PG, given 1 wk before injection of CFA, results in a significant increase in incidence and severity of the arthritis induced. Rats injected with CFA have both antibody and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) to PG. Upon pretreatment of rats with PG i.v., both DTH and antibody titers to PG are increased. Rats immunized with PG in IFA have high titers of anti-PG and strong DTH to PG, which are also enhanced by pretreatment with PG i.v., although none of these animals develops arthritis. In contrast to these findings in rats, when mice are pretreated with PG i.v., DTH to PG induced by injection of CFA is lower, whereas anti-PG titers are higher than in unpretreated controls. The results presented here show that, in rats, i.v. injection of PG synergizes with CFA in the induction of AA, and enhances both humoral and cellular immunity to PG. The findings support the hypothesis that immunity to PG is of importance in AA, although under the conditions of these experiments immunity induced by PG alone is clearly not sufficient for the induction of arthritis.\r"

The lymphokine, IL-4 has been shown to increase expression of class II Ag on B cells and induce B cell proliferation. In the murine system, IL-4 induced differentiation of precursor B cells into pre-B cells. In order to analyze growth factors on B cell development we have established an in vitro culture system for human bone marrow cells. We found that in the presence of IL-4, normal human precursor and pre-B cells can be induced to differentiate in the absence of cell proliferation with four days of culture. Furthermore, IL-4 depressed proliferation induced by supernatant from a T cell line. The differentiation was measured by an increase in both the number of cytoplasmic mu and surface IgM-positive cells. The effect of IL-4 on precursor and pre-B cell differentiation was detected as soon as 14 h of exposure to the lymphokine in the absence of an adherent feeder layer. These data suggest that IL-4 directly affects the differentiation process of normal human precursor and pre-B cells, and may antagonistically affect cell proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "The proliferation of murine T cell clones can be supported by IL-2 or by IL-4. We present here evidence that glucocorticosteroids differentially affect these two pathways of proliferation. Dexamethasone (DEX) and other corticosteroids were observed to induce autocrine proliferation of the D10.G4.1 Th cell clone (D10) in the presence of the anti-clonotypic antibody 3D3. This effect was inhibited by the anti-murine IL-4 antibody 11B11, indicating that it is mediated by IL-4. Furthermore, on this cell line, representative of the Th2 group of helper cells, DEX had little effect on the proliferation induced by exogenous IL-4 but completely inhibited the growth-promoting effects of IL-2. In contrast, the effects of DEX on the proliferation of the cytotoxic IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cell line are completely opposite. DEX blocked the IL-4-driven proliferation of CTLL-2 cells, while leaving unaffected their response to IL-2. It is also shown in this study that the effects of glucocorticoids in this system are totally antagonized by the high affinity anti-glucocorticosteroid RU 38486, indicating that they are mediated through the described intracellular glucocorticoid receptor. These data suggest that the growth effects of IL-2 and IL-4 may be mediated by distinct pathways that are strikingly different in their sensitivity to glucocorticoids. In addition, the regulation of lymphokine-dependent proliferation and the response to glucocorticoids appeared very different in helper and cytotoxic cells.\r"

In these cell lines, IL-2 mRNA was not detectable in RNA extracted from whole adult T cell leukemia cell populations because of dilution by other RNA species from the vast majority of cells that do not contain IL-2 mRNA. The data indicate the possibility of paracrine growth stimulation via IL-2 and its receptor even in those human T lymphotropic virus I-infected T cell populations that apparently lack IL-2 activity when analyzed by conventional assay procedures.\r"

Biosynthetically radiolabeled murine B cells were incubated for 2 h in the presence or absence of T lymphocytes before treatment with the cleavable cross-linking reagent dimethyl-3,3'-dithiobispropionimidate. Anti-Ia immunoprecipitates of solubilized cell extracts revealed novel cross-linked products of Mr 90,000 to 95,000 which, upon cleavage of the cross-linker, could in part be resolved into native Ia and other structures of approximately Mr 67,000. The detection of the cross-linked products was significantly enhanced in B cells that had been co-cultured with T lymphocytes, but not with other cell types, and co-culture with various monoclonal T cell lines resulted in different levels of enhancement. Detection of the 90- to 95-kDa cross-linked products appeared to be independent of the foreign Ag for which the T cells were specific and could be enhanced when either cell type was replaced by a plasma membrane fraction, indicating that it resulted from direct cell-cell contact. These results suggest that some proportion of the Ia glycoproteins expressed on the surface of B cells become associated with other structures of Mr 67,000 upon Ag-non-specific interactions between T and B lymphocytes.\r"

Fusions of this type yielded hybridomas, the majority of which failed to express Lyt-2. In the minority of hybridomas that did express surface Lyt-2, expression was transient and greatly diminished in terms of molecules of Lyt-2 per cell. Lack of Lyt-2 expression was not due to loss of the gene encoding this cell surface molecule; rather, negative regulation of Lyt-2 appeared to be at the level of transcription (i.e., no Lyt-2 transcripts were detected in these hybridomas). We have shown that the Lyt-2 gene is undermethylated in normal Lyt-2+ T cells, whereas the gene is heavily methylated in Lyt-2- liver cells and in BW5147. Loss of Lyt-2 expression in (BW5147 x Lyt-2+ SJL/J lymph node cell) hybridomas was associated with remethylation of DNA within the Lyt-2 gene and at sites 5' of the Lyt-2 gene.\r"

  ".W": "The present study has characterized the short term and long term cultured murine-activated killer (AK) cells that are induced by antibody directed against the epsilon-chain of T3 complex. The conventional lymphokine AK (LAK) cells were generated by culturing normal B6 spleen cells with purified human rIL-2. The alpha T3-induced AK cells (T3AK) were induced by culturing normal B6 spleen cells with alpha T3 and were then maintained in culture medium supplemented with human rIL-2 and/or alpha T3. After initial activation with alpha T3, lymphocyte proliferation and generation of cytotoxic effectors (T3AK) were noted, and these events were related to the endogenous production of IL-2 and IL-4. Addition of alpha IL-2 and/or alpha IL-4 suppressed both the proliferative response and the cytotoxic response induced by alpha T3. In comparing the T3AK cells with the conventional LAK cells, there were many similarities as well as some distinct differences. Both cells displayed a similar cytotoxic spectrum against a variety of tumor targets. The T3AK cells usually gave much higher levels of cytotoxic activity against susceptible targets. However, the susceptibility of different tumor targets to conventional LAK cells and T3AK cells varied. The time course for the generation of lytic activity also differed between the conventional LAK and T3AK cells. One distinct difference was their ability to survive in vitro. The conventional LAK cells survived in culture for only 1 wk. The T3AK cells could survive for at least 4 to 5 wk with active growth. The serologic phenotype of the LAK precursors was asialo GM1 (AsGM1+) cells, but the T3AK precursors could be either AsGM1+ or AsGM1-, depending on the target cell. The LAK effectors were both Lyt-2+ and Lyt-2-, but the short-term T3AK effectors were exclusively Lyt-2+. The long term T3AK cells (cultured for more than 2 wk) were found to consist of Lyt-2+ and Lyt-2- cells, and these subsets of T3AK cells showed different target specificities. These findings demonstrate the heterogeneity of LAK and T3AK cells, and this heterogeneous property may contribute to their diversity in specificity against different tumor targets and thus may affect their effectiveness in the immunotherapy of cancer.\r"

To characterize these anti-idiotopes further, they were used to immunize mice and rabbits. Several murine anti-anti-Idiotype mAb (Ab3), mostly of IgM-k isotype, were obtained. mAb3 and sera from rabbits immunized with Ab2 contained antibodies that bind to gp37 Ag and leukemic MOLT-4 and JM cells. Also, mAb3 and immune sera from rabbits competed with Ab1 for binding to MOLT-4 cells. They inhibited the binding of iodinated Ab1 to Ab2 indicating that Ab3 in mice and rabbits shares idiotopes with Ab1 (SN2). Furthermore, both the murine mAb3 and rabbit polyclonal Ab3 immunoprecipitated the same gp37 Ag as SN2 (Ab1). The production of Ag-specific Ab3 (Ab1') in mice and rabbits in absence of any exposure to gp37 indicates that these Ab2 may indeed carry the internal image of the gp37 Ag. Such anti-idiotopes (Ab2 beta) may be useful as Ag substitute for the induction of therapeutic immunity in T cell leukemia patients.\r"

As accessory cells we used autologous, as well as allogeneic, monocytes, and dendritic cell enriched cells. Both NK and T cells were able to generate LAK activity, but their activation requirements were different. NK cells were activated merely by IL-2, and accessory cells did not enhance their lytic activity in the presence or absence of IL-2. Conversely, T cells were practically unresponsive to even high concentrations of IL-2 having a strict requirement for accessory cells for the development of lytic activity and proliferation. Accessory cells differed in their ability to activate T cells presumably depending on their ability to induce IL-2 synthesis, allogeneic dendritic cells being the most effective accessory cells and IL-2 synthesis stimulators. Allogeneic accessory cells could induce lytic activity in T cells even in the absence of exogenous IL-2. Thus, accessory cells play a central role in expanding the LAK effector cell population.\r"

Langerhans cells (LC) are essential for initiation and maintenance of specific T-cell-mediate responses in the skin. Therefore, a change in this antigen-presenting LC population may alter the host response. To determine whether the LC population varies during the evolution of primary cutaneous melanoma 32 melanocytic lesions, nevi, and cutaneous melanomas were studied by quantitative immunohistology. The monoclonal antibody, Leu-6, and the avidin biotin complex immunoperoxidase method were used to identify LC. Compared with histologically normal melanoma-adjacent skin, epidermal LC were depleted above \"deeply invasive\" melanomas but were relatively unchanged above nevi, \"early invasive\" melanomas, and cutaneous metastatic melanoma nodules. Dermal LC were significantly increased around in situ and \"early invasive\" melanomas but not around \"deeply invasive\" melanomas or cutaneous metastatic nodules. Dermal LC are thus associated with early transformed melanocytes and may present neoantigens to T lymphocytes in situ or after LC maturation in the draining lymph node. Melanoma-associated LC decline in number as melanoma progresses.\r"

  ".W": "Intracellular calcium ([Ca++]i) plays an important role in signal transduction and cell activation. The measurement of [Ca++]i in intact monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with the fluorescent calcium-sensitive probe fura 2 has been evaluated. Monolayers provide a more physiologic cell preparation than suspensions and allow a greater variety of experimental manipulation. Basal [Ca++]i was 117 +/- 5 nmol/L, with a range from 40 to 280 nmol/L that was not affected by cell age (days of primary culture) or degree of confluence. Thrombin in concentrations of 0.005 to 5 NIH units/ml produced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca++]i up to a maximum of 1500 +/- 147 nmol/L; this increase was shown to depend in part on the concentration of extracellular calcium. The presence of antithrombin III at physiologic concentrations abolished responses to 0.5 NIH units/ml thrombin but had no effect on 5 NIH units/ml. The potential of this technique was demonstrated further by our ability to examine [Ca++]i responses in endothelial cells following infection with herpes simplex virus type 1, a virus implicated in vascular injury. After 18 hours' infection, the response to both thrombin and histamine was dramatically reduced despite a normal resting [Ca++]i. It is concluded that this method may be useful for detecting early and subtle changes in endothelial cell function under a variety of physiologic and pathologic conditions.\r"

In this study, the accessory function of monocytes from healthy subjects (n = 9) and subjects with AIDS (n = 4) and PGL (n = 5) was assessed by adding graded numbers of monocytes to lymphocytes stimulated with either tetanus toxoid or phytohemagglutinin. By nonparametric analysis, it was determined that a significantly greater number of monocytes was required for half-maximal responses of lymphocytes from subjects with PGL (for tetanus toxid but not phytohemagglutinin) and from those with AIDS, compared with healthy subjects. To address whether this observed difference was a result of a defect in accessory function of monocytes or a result of altered responsiveness of lymphocytes, a mixing experiment was performed between monocytes and lymphocytes obtained from a patient with PGL but without symptoms and an HLA-D-matched healthy sib. Dysfunction of both monocytes and lymphocytes was evident. Thus, this report provides data that monocytes in HIV infection are defective in accessory function for lymphocyte responses to soluble stimuli. We speculate that such dysfunction of monocytes may contribute to the progressive disturbance of the immune response that occurs during HIV infection.\r"

At the time of this study 80 per cent of the subjects showed also a certain degree of increased blood viscosity. The most common finding in the group was slow and progressive bilateral sensorineural loss of hearing. In most of the subjects the labyrinthine damage began with high-tone loss which, in time, became a flat curve. Less common, but still found in many patients, was a fluctuation in threshold. Short periods of spontaneous subjective improvement in hearing were accompanied by a better result in the Pure Tone Audiogram and Speech Reception Threshold. The discrimination scores remained generally lower than expected. Vestibular examination revealed pathological results for all the subjects in at least some of the tests. The mild subjective complaints concerning equilibrium could be explained by a central nervous system compensation.\r"

Immunologic evaluation at 5 years of age revealed persistent lymphopenia, decreased helper-suppressor T cell ratios, and low proliferative responses to mitogens. The IgG, IgM, and IgA levels were normal; the IgG2 level was low normal or below normal. The patient had specific antibodies against toxoids and viral antigens but failed to produce antibodies against Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal polysaccharides. Although no symptoms of allergy were present, she had persistent eosinophilia and elevated IgE levels. The patient had 0.6% of normal ADA activity in erythrocytes and approximately 1% of normal ADA activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Beginning at 6 years of age, she was treated with weekly injections of polyethylene glycol-modified bovine ADA. This treatment was well tolerated and effectively reversed the biochemical consequence of ADA deficiency. Concomitantly, she improved clinically and her T lymphocyte numbers and blastogenic responses to mitogens in vitro became normal. The late onset of clinical symptoms and relatively benign clinical course in this patient emphasize the need to consider ADA deficiency in a broad spectrum of immunodeficient children.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was assessed at varying cell densities from 3 X 10(3)-1 X 10(5) cells/culture in response to mitogen stimulation, using a cellular interleukin assay in which IL-2 responsive CTLL-2 indicator cells were added directly to stimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures. It was found that in both RA and SLE there was a significant overproduction of IL-2 demonstrable at low cell densities. At high cell densities, IL-2 production was decreased in SLE but remained enhanced in RA. The former abnormality appears to be related to disease activity and was not reversed by irradiation, suggesting that it is not the result of the actions of a radiation sensitive suppressor cell population. The possibility is discussed that a local hyper-production of IL-2 could induce disturbances of the immune response, resulting in the breaking of normal tolerance.\r"

Borrelia burgdorferi stimulated normal and patients' cells produced IgM, with cells from acutely ill patients producing the most; production fell during convalescence. Patients with active Lyme disease and those destined for later manifestations often had serum agglutinins for heterologous red blood cells. Thus, there is in vitro and in vivo B cell hyperactivity in Lyme disease caused by B. burgdorferi. Both mitogenic and antigenic stimulation of B cells may induce the humoral response seen in complicated Lyme disease.\r"

Quantifying the lung damage in these patients is difficult, and complement levels combined with clinical parameters of oxygenation might help define the severity of pulmonary deterioration. Forty-five high-risk patients, selected by arterial blood gas criteria, had their pulmonary insult related to C3a and C5a levels. Patients were stratified by pulmonary shunt, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, and radiographic findings into two categories of severity: pulmonary dysfunction, a milder insult, and ARDS, a major aberration in pulmonary function. The clinical assignment of a diagnostic category required at least 96 hours of monitoring. During this 96-hour period, multiple complement levels were obtained. These complement levels were then compared in pulmonary dysfunction and ARDS patients. ARDS patients had significantly higher C3a and C5a values after the patients were selected as high risk. These results suggest that the amount of complement activated in patients with incipient respiratory failure correlates with the severity of eventual pulmonary insult. The use of arterial blood gases and C3a and C5a levels should allow better and earlier definition of patients at risk for ARDS.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed the results of early (less than 24 hours) coronary artery bypass after unsuccessful percutaneous coronary artery angioplasty in 146 patients treated between October 1979 and July 1986. Overall operative mortality was 2.7%, and risk was significantly increased among patients with hemodynamic instability and new occlusion or further narrowing of the dilated vessel (3.8 versus 0%, p less than 0.05). Actuarial analysis was used to compute the rates of cardiac events during the follow-up interval, and event rates were also estimated in a comparison group of 776 patients who had successful first-time PTCA during the same time period. At a follow-up interval of 5 years, the cumulative risks of recurrence of angina and need for an additional procedure (bypass or angioplasty) were significantly (p less than 0.05) lower for patients who had undergone bypass than for those who had successful angioplasty (angina 21% versus 56%, PTCA 2% versus 21%, CAB 6% versus 16%). Cumulative risks of myocardial infarction and death were 4% versus 9% and 6% versus 9% in the two groups. The differences between late outcomes in the bypass and angioplasty groups persisted when patients were stratified into cohorts with single-vessel and multivessel disease, and the highest late event rate occurred in patients in the angioplasty group who had incomplete revascularization. The difference in late events after bypass or angioplasty was greatest during the first year. These late data should be considered when the mode of revascularization (bypass or angioplasty) is selected for symptomatic patients, especially those with multivessel disease.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1980 and 1987, 40 patients with ischemic mitral insufficiency underwent mitral valve replacement (with a mechanical prosthesis) and coronary bypass grafting, 3.5 grafts per patient. The posterior mitral leaflet was preserved in 17 and resected in 23. Five arrived at operation in cardiogenic shock, 15 after recurrent episodes of pulmonary edema, and 20 electively, but in congestive heart failure. Twenty-five had unstable angina, and the remaining had chronic angina. Perioperative and early deaths occurred only in patients with an ejection fraction less than 35%. None of the 21 patients with an ejection fraction greater than 35% died, whereas eight of 19 with an ejection fraction less than 35% died, whereas eight of 19 with an ejection fraction less than 35% died (p less than 0.001). When causes of death in patients with an ejection fraction less than 35% were studied, operative and early mortality was zero of seven with preservation of the posterior mitral leaflet versus eight of 11 with excision of the leaflet (p = 0.035). We concluded that the high mortality in mitral valve replacement for ischemic mitral insufficiency is linked to an ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% and, in this particular group of patients, is due to the surgical destruction of the left ventricular chordae tendineae supportive apparatus. Preservation of this apparatus by preservation of the posterior mitral leaflet drastically reduces operative and early mortality. Preoperative cardiogenic shock, left ventricular aneurysmectomy, and multiple grafting (up to five grafts per patient) did not increase the risk of operation. Extensive revascularization (3.5 grafts per patient) provides improved long-term results.\r"

Lysosomal and mitochondrial enzymes and cyclic nucleotides (adenosine cyclic monophosphate and guanosine cyclic monophosphate) were measured in coronary sinus blood. Aprotinin was given intravenously before cardiopulmonary bypass at total doses of 10 X 10(3) kallikrein units per kilogram (group A, six dogs) and 20 X 10(3) KU/kg (group B, six dogs). In group A, three dogs survived but with poor cardiac function; all dogs in group B survived and had better cardiac function. Lysosomal (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase) and mitochondrial (aspartate aminotransferase) enzymes in coronary sinus blood at 60 minutes of reperfusion were significantly (p less than 0.05) lower in group B than in group A. In both groups, guanosine cyclic monophosphate was significantly (p less than 0.01) lower during reperfusion than before cardiopulmonary bypass; however, the values were significantly (p less than 0.05) higher in group B than in group A. Serum adenosine cyclic monophosphate was lower during reperfusion than before bypass in both groups, but it recovered during reperfusion in group B. Myocardial adenosine triphosphate was well preserved in both groups but creatine phosphate was decreased (p less than 0.01) in group A. These results suggest that aprotinin at a dose of 20 X 10(3) KU/kg may be effective in preserving myocardial viability and function after prolonged cardioplegia.\r"

Test results were consistent with previous reports. Neuropsychologic deficits after cardiac operation are not uncommon, though they are often subtle and generally resolve by the sixth month after operation. Postoperative deficit was significant on measures of attention, psychomotor speed, and fine motor dexterity, but considerable interpatient performance variability was noted. Other findings imply that nonspecific aspects or surgery may make a substantial contribution to the immediate postoperative deficit in patients who have cardiac operations.\r"

Such presentation involves two distinct steps: (1) display of the antigen, which requires uptake, processing and re-expression of the antigen in association with MHC molecules on the presenting cell surface; and (2) triggering, in which the presenting cell provides signals leading to the activation of the responding T cell. Two sorts of cells can capture antigens, the 'professional' antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells and macrophages, and the B cells. Both types of cells can display antigens and the APCs are known to be able to trigger resting T cells. But despite in vitro evidence that certain B-cell types can reactivate previously-activated T cells, it is not yet clear whether a B cell can initiate an immune response by providing the signals necessary to activate a resting T cell. We reasoned that resting B cells should not have this capacity because of the problems this would present with tolerance to self idiotypes. By exploiting the unique properties of the avian haematopoietic system, we have examined the presenting capacity of B cells in vivo and found that resting B cells are indeed unable to activate resting T cells.\r"

It was hypothesized that in at least some of these infants a surgical approach (focal resection, cerebral hemispherectomy) might be of benefit in achieving seizure control, and that PET might assist in surgical selection. In three of the eight subjects, interictal PET revealed unilateral diffuse hypometabolism; following cerebral hemispherectomy in these three patients, all seizures ceased and there were no adverse effects. In one child, ictal PET showed hypermetabolism in the left frontal cortex, left striatum, and right cerebellum; a partial left cerebral hemispherectomy guided by intraoperative electrocorticography was performed, following which all seizures ceased. One infant had relative hypermetabolism in the right temporal and occipital lobes, right thalamus, and left frontal lobe on ictal PET, and EEG telemetry revealed a right occipitotemporal epileptic focus; this infant died from anesthetic complications following right occipitotemporal cortical resection. Of the three unoperated patients, one is a potential candidate for right frontal lobectomy, but the other two were not considered to be surgical candidates due to bilateral epileptogenicity. Neuropathologic correlation in our series revealed that PET is a sensitive test capable of detecting cytoarchitectural disturbances whereas CT and MRI failed in this regard. In addition, PET provides a very unique and important assessment of the functional integrity of brain regions outside the area of potential resection.\r"

The proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, or pokeweed mitogen was decreased in the HAM patients. Cell clusters were frequent in cultures of unstimulated PBL from the HAM patients, but much less common in the controls or carriers. This spontaneous PBL proliferation was depressed when adherent-cell populations were depleted from the cultures. IL-2 activity increased in the supernatant of 3-day cultured cells from HAM patients, but not in cultured cells from the controls. Since IL-2 receptor positive cells increased in HAM, this spontaneous PBL proliferation is probably a response to IL-2 through the expression of IL-2 receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Acute respiratory failure has a high mortality in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This study was undertaken to determine the etiology of acute respiratory failure and the outcome of children with AIDS and AIDS-related complex. Records of 31 children with AIDS or AIDS-related complex admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for acute respiratory failure throughout a 46-month period were reviewed. Acute respiratory failure was due to Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in 13, cytomegalovirus pneumonia in six, bacterial pneumonia in five, severe bacterial sepsis in four, Candida pneumonia in two, and a giant cell pneumonia in one patient. In addition, 11/19 patients with acute respiratory failure due to P carinii pneumonia or cytomegalovirus had superinfections with bacteria or Candida. Of the total of 19 primary and secondary bacterial infections, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was responsible in ten and Klebsiella pneumoniae in three children. Five children (16%) survived until pediatric intensive care unit discharge; three died within 6 months. The causes of acute respiratory failure were not significantly different in survivor and nonsurvivor groups. It is concluded that, in addition to P carinii pneumonia and cytomegalovirus pneumonia, bacterial infections (especially due to Pseudomonas and other Gram-negative organisms) are important causes of respiratory failure. The high mortality and grim ultimate prognosis seen may have implications for pediatricians attempting to identify the proper limits of medical intervention for this group of patients.\r"

We have expressed the product of one of these genes, UL9, in insect cells by using a baculovirus expression vector. The apparent size of the UL9 protein, both in insect cells and in herpes simplex virus-infected Vero cells, is 82,000 Da. By using an immunoassay for protein-DNA interaction, we have shown that UL9 protein binds specifically to the herpes simplex virus origins of DNA replication, oriS and oriL. DNase I \"footprint\" analysis has shown that the UL9 protein interacts with two related sites on oriS, located on each arm of a nearly perfect palindrome. Our data strongly suggest that the origin-binding activity described previously by Elias et al. [Elias, P., O'Donnell, M. E., Mocarski, E. S. & Lehman, I. R. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Complete sequences of three cDNA inserts yielded a cumulative sequence of 5106 base pairs. The deduced protein had 1289 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 148,431. The determination of an open reading frame was aided by the amino acid sequences of 21 tryptic peptides isolated from bovine brain phospholipase C. Only 9 residues of a total of 140 amino acid residues determined for the bovine enzyme were different from those deduced from the rat cDNA. Two regions of phospholipase C (amino acid residues 555-598 and 668-705) exhibited significant amino acid similarities to the products of various tyrosine kinase-related oncogenes (yes, src, fgr, abl, fps, fes, and tck). The homologous domain was located in the region that is not essential for the protein-tyrosine kinase activity but is likely to be involved in an interaction with cellular components that modulate kinase function. Therefore, this unexpected similarity raises the possibility that the 148-kDa phospholipase C and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases are modulated by common cellular component(s).\r"

  ".W": "Corticotropin (ACTH) secretion by the anterior pituitary is stimulated by catecholamines in vivo and in vitro. The nature of the response in vivo is controversial but appears to be mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors, whereas the response is dependent on alpha-adrenergic receptors in cultured anterior pituitary cells. In the present studies, by using a superfusion technique, we demonstrate that catecholamine stimulation of ACTH release from rat anterior pituitaries changes with time from a predominantly beta-adrenergic-mediated event to a predominantly alpha-adrenergic-mediated event. From 0 to 2 hr after initiating the superfusion, release of ACTH from anterior pituitary glands is stimulated up to 2.4-fold by the beta-adrenergic agonist l-isoproterenol. However, the ACTH secretory response to the alpha-adrenergic agonist l-phenylephrine is less than or equal to 5% of that to l-isoproterenol during the same time period. Beginning 2 hr after the start of the superfusion, the responsiveness to the beta-adrenergic agonist declines, and the response to the alpha-adrenergic agonist increases until, 10 hr after removal, greater than 95% of the catecholamine-inducible ACTH release is mediated by an alpha-adrenergic pathway. The addition of interleukin 1 alone to the medium from the beginning of the superfusion does not modify basal ACTH secretion rates and does not affect the acquisition of the response to phenylephrine. However, the presence of interleukin 1 does allow the maintenance of the full ACTH secretory response to isoproterenol. This effect of interleukin 1 is reversed by an interleukin 1 antagonist. These observations suggest an additional way in which immune regulators might interact with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\r"

The MIC2 HTF island is unmethylated on both the active and inactive X chromosome and is similarly unmethylated on the Y chromosome. Unlike the majority of genes borne on the X chromosome, MIC2 fails to undergo X chromosome inactivation. HTF islands associated with X chromosome-linked genes that are inactivated are highly methylated on the inactive or transcriptionally silent homologue. The failure of MIC2 to undergo X chromosome inactivation correlates with the lack of methylation of the HTF island at the 5' end of the gene. These results provide further evidence that DNA methylation plays an important role in the phenomenon of X chromosome inactivation.\r"

In eight unrelated subjects homozygous for 6.7-kilobase (kb) deletions, the breakpoints are within two blocks of highly homologous DNA sequences that lie 5' and 3' to the GH1 gene. In seven of these eight cases, the breakpoints map within a 1250-base-pair (bp) region composed of 300-bp Alu sequences of 86% homology and flanking non-Alu sequences that are 600 and 300 bp in length and are of 96% and 88% homology, respectively. In the eighth patient, the breakpoints are 5' to these Alu repeats and are most likely within a 700-bp region of 96% homologous DNA sequences. In the ninth patient homozygous for a 7.6-kb deletion, the breakpoints are contained within a 29-bp perfect repeat lying 5' to GH1 and the human chorionic somatomammotropin pseudogene (CSHP1). Together, these results indicate that the presence of highly homologous DNA sequences flanking GH1 predispose to recurrent unequal recombinational events presumably through chromosomal misalignment.\r"

This correlation has led to the suggestion that CD4 binds to a monomorphic region of the Ia molecule on the antigen-presenting cell (APC) and functions either by enhancing interaction between the T cell and the APC, or conversely, by transducing negative signals to the T cell. To address this hypothesis, we have made use of sublines from an unusual T hybrid that is class I MHC restricted but also CD4+. By incorporating purified MHC proteins into a planar membrane system, we show that different Ia molecules can greatly enhance the ability of a CD4+ but not a CD4- variant of this class I-restricted T hybrid to respond to isolated class I molecules. T-cell responses can be strongly augmented by the concurrent expression of CD4 on the T cell and any of four different Ia proteins on planar membranes, thus supporting the idea that CD4 binds to a monomorphic region of the Ia molecule and increases the avidity with which the T cell can interact with its target.\r"

Most mature T lymphocytes have, on their membrane, an antigen receptor consisting of alpha and beta subunits, while early T cells and thymocytes possess a heterodimeric receptor termed gamma-delta. The DS6 clone, isolated from the peripheral blood of a patient with immunodeficiency, is a CD3+, CD4-, CD8- human T-cell line that expresses the disulfide-linked form of the gamma-delta antigen receptor. The nucleotide sequence analysis of DS6 cDNA makes clear that its variable region is a member of an alpha variable-region gene family. We have cloned and sequenced the germ-line joining and variable regions used to create the DS6 delta mRNA. Comparison of these sequences does not show evidence of extensive somatic mutations. The major difference between the germ-line and the T-cell antigen receptor delta cDNA sequence is an insertion of three consecutive nucleotides between the variable and joining segments and is evocative of somatic diversification rather than of the use of a germ-line-encoded diversity region.\r"

IL-1 alpha and -beta are encoded by ancestrally related genes that have diverged dramatically in primary sequence; however, only modest differences in the regulation or biological activity of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta have been documented. Here we show that mouse L cells transfected with murine pro-IL-1 alpha cDNA expressed biologically active, 33-kilodalton pro-IL-1 alpha, and that this pro molecule was neither processed to the 17-kilodalton mature form nor secreted. The transfected cells also expressed membrane-associated IL-1 biological activity, indicating that the pro-IL-1 alpha cDNA can direct expression of membrane-associated IL-1 and that cleavage of the pro molecule is not required for membrane presentation. In contrast, transfection of pro-IL-1 beta cDNA did not generate biologically active material in L cells. Evidence is presented that the native murine IL-1 beta precursor molecule is also biologically inactive in peritoneal exudate cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. These differences in distribution of the bioactive forms of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta may provide selective advantages for the maintenance of two gene products with similar functions.\r"

Functional studies demonstrated that transgenic skin was rapidly rejected by normal C57BL/6 mice and that cytotoxic T lymphocytes generated by immunization of the Cw3 transgenic mice with influenza and Sendai virus were restricted by the Cw3 molecule.

A 980-base-pair subclone of fragment EM was identified, and its nucleotide sequence revealed three small open reading frames (ORFs), encoding 79, 83, and 34 amino acid residues. S1 nuclease analysis of HCMV-infected cells identified several distinct early RNA species within mtrII, two of which (P1 and P2) were of particular interest, since the length of the protected DNA fragments would position the 5' end of the RNAs upstream of the open reading frames. In addition, the 980-base-pair transforming sequence revealed DNA elements capable of forming stem-loop structures. Thus the transforming mtrII domain of HCMV strain Towne contains both small open reading frames that are expressed in lytically infected cells and sequences resembling insertion-like structures that may be involved in transformation.\r"

The effects of CGRP on the functional properties of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChoR) were examined by electrophysiological methods. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique and a mouse cell line derived from soleus muscle, we found that CGRP produces a progressive and reversible enhancement of the rapid-decay phase of AcChoR desensitization. Single-channel data further show that CGRP decreases acetylcholine-activated channel opening frequency. This decrease occurs when CGRP and acetylcholine are applied on different cell-surface areas and thus is likely mediated by a second-messenger system. CGRP is also shown to increase cAMP accumulation in this cell line. The effects of CGRP on macroscopic acetylcholine-activated currents are mimicked by external application of forskolin (10 microM) or by internal perfusion of the cell with cAMP (1 microM). In both these cases, further application of CGRP produces no additional enhancement of AcChoR desensitization. These results suggest that, on mouse muscle cells, CGRP regulates AcChoR desensitization by a mechanism that involves, at least in part, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the AcChoR.\r"

The effect of changing T-tubule membrane potential on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) stimulation of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum was studied to explore a possible role for InsP3 as a chemical signal in excitation-contraction coupling. InsP3 was microinjected into peeled rabbit skeletal muscle fibers at a pipette concentration of 0.5 microM; Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum was monitored as an isometric tension transient. The response to 0.5 microM InsP3 was significantly larger when T-tubules were in a depolarized state than when they were in a polarized state, and this difference in response was independent of the ionic composition of the bathing solutions or the method for depolarizing the T-tubules. Thus, T-tubule depolarization may sensitize the sarcoplasmic reticulum to a preexisting low concentration of InsP3 and greatly reduce the need for InsP3 production. Plasmalemma voltage control of the stimulatory effects of InsP3 may have relevance for mechanisms in excitable nonmuscle cells.\r"

Forty-five percent (221) of the distributed surveys were returned. Descriptive statistics and chi-square calculations were used in the data analysis. Respondents frequently used two forms of pulsed current and rarely used two forms of alternating current. No form of electrical current was used as frequently as ultrasound. The frequency and type of electrical stimulation used depended on the availability of electrical stimulators and the adequacy of entry-level training in electrotherapy.

Using this model, we conducted a study of the nasomaxillary region that has led us to conclude that facial bones do in fact regulate their own growth.

The mating-type clones contain nonhomologous DNA segments that are flanked by common DNA sequences. Neurospora crassa and all heterothallic and pseudohomothallic Neurospora species contain a single copy of one mating-type sequence or the other within each haploid genome. The six known self-fertile homothallic isolates contain an A homolog, but only one species also contains a homologous sequences. Homothallism in these species is not due to mating-type switching, as it is in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\r"

  ".W": "The binding of antigen or monoclonal antibody to the T cell receptor for antigen or the closely associated CD3 complex causes increases in the concentration of intracellular ionized calcium and subsequent cell proliferation. By measuring second messenger production in primary cultures of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)--infected T cells stimulated with monoclonal antibodies specific for either CD3 or CD2, a specific impairment of membrane signaling was revealed. The HIV-1--infected T cells were unable to mobilize Ca2+ after stimulation with anti-CD3, whereas CD2-induced calcium mobilization remained intact. Furthermore, the HIV-1--infected cells proliferated poorly after CD3 stimulation, although the cells retained normal DNA synthesis in response to interleukin-2 stimulation. These results show that the signals initiated by CD2 and CD3 can be regulated independently within the same T cell; uncoupling of signal transduction after antigen-specific stimulation provides a biochemical mechanism to explain, in part, the profound immunodeficiency of patients with HIV-1 infection.\r"

A peptide mixture composed of CD4(76-94), and synthesis side products, blocked HIV-induced cell fusion at a nominal concentration of 125 micromolar. Upon high-performance liquid chromatography, the antisyncytial activity of the peptide mixture was found not in the fraction containing the peptide CD4(76-94) itself, but in a side fraction containing derivatized peptide products generated in the automated synthesis. Derivatized deletion and substitution peptides in the region CD4(76-94) were used to demonstrate sequence specificity, a requirement for benzyl derivatization, and a core seven-residue fragment required for antisyncytial activity. A partially purified S-benzyl-CD4(83-94) peptide mixture inhibited HIV-induced cell fusion at a nominal concentration of less than or equal to 32 micromolar. Derivatized CD4 peptides blocked cell fusion induced by several HIV isolates and by the simian immunodeficiency virus, SIV, and blocked infection in vitro by four HIV-1 isolates with widely variant envelope gene sequences. Purified CD4(83-94) dibenzylated at cysteine 86 and glutamate 87 possessed antisyncytial activity at 125 micromolar. Derivatization may specifically alter the conformation of CD4 holoreceptor peptide fragments, increasing their antiviral efficacy.\r"

Understanding of concussion has been hampered by the lack of a uniform definition, with many authors including cases with gross, irreversible changes. The phenomenon occurs only with a blow that significantly accelerates and thus is best defined as \"a transient disturbance of neuronal function as a result of acceleration.\" There must be a threshold beneath which no loss of function occurs and a ceiling beyond which changes are not reversible. Experiments with nonanesthetized frogs revealed that at 33 g only the occasional frog would be stunned. From 50 to 230 g, consciousness was always lost but rapidly regained and retained, while beyond, the loss was not always reversible. The time of functional loss was increasingly proportional to acceleration.\r"

Postoperatively, the temporal bones were studied with a scanning electron microscope. The portions of the cochlear nerve fibers and branches of the internal auditory artery that exit from the bony cochlea into the internal auditory canal were susceptible to traction force derived from manipulations in the cerebellopontine angle. The cochlear nerve fibers from the basal turn of the cochlea were most easily pulled out from the fundus of the internal auditory canal. In some cases, massive hemorrhages and exudation of plasma were observed in the entire modiolus; these compressed the cochlear nerve trunk. The Schwann-glial junctions of the cochlear nerves were separated in some dogs, indicating this junction was one of the most vulnerable sites to operative manipulations in the cerebellopontine angle.\r"

  ".W": "Although the macrophage is important to wound healing, research has focused on its relationship to fibroblast and collagen synthesis. This study was designed to assess effects of enhanced macrophage function on early wound healing, before established collagen synthesis. Sprague-Dawley rats had dorsal incisions after one of three treatment regimens: (1) saline solution, 0.5 ml administered intravenously, (2) intravenous glucan, a macrophage stimulant, 20 mg; (3) topical glucan, 20 mg. Intravenous therapy was administered 24 hours before and after incision. Breaking strength was significantly increased (p less than 0.01) by both intravenous glucan (49.8 +/- 5.5 gm) and topical glucan (59.7 +/- 5.6 gm) on the fourth day after incision, compared with controls (22.0 +/- 2.6 gm). Similar results occurred on the seventh day after incision. Although formalin fixation significantly enhanced breaking strength in fresh control wounds (22.0 +/- 2.6 vs 39.5 +/- 2.2 gm), no increase occurred in wounds treated with intravenous glucan (49.8 +/- 5.0 vs 55.3 +/- 6.4 gm), indicating maximal cross-linking of collagen. Collagen synthesis, reflected by tritiated proline uptake, was no different in control versus glucan groups. Supernatants from control or glucan-activated macrophages were injected intraperitoneally or applied topically in the rat model. Activated supernatant, both intraperitoneal and topical, resulted in increased breaking strength on the fourth day after incision. Formalin fixation did not increase breaking strength in the activated supernatant groups. We conclude that enhanced macrophage function increases early wound breaking strength. This effect appears unrelated to collagen synthesis but may be related to increased cross-linking of collagen. Similar effects are seen with activated macrophage secretory products administered intraperitoneally or topically.\r"

This study was designed to clarify the relationship between cutaneous thermal injury, oxygen radical formation, and complement activation in vivo. A model for \"selective\" venous sampling from the area of a partial-thickness cutaneous burn over 25% to 30% of the total body surface in the rat was developed. Interventions involving oxygen radical scavengers, antioxidant enzymes, xanthine oxidase inhibitors, an iron chelator, complement depletion, and neutrophil depletion were used to probe the nature of the oxygen products involved in complement activation. Plasma from the area of burn was examined for total hemolytic complement activity, content of C5a-related chemotactic peptide, and relationship of oxygen products to appearance of this peptide. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, hydroxyl radical scavengers, and complement depletion diminished the generation of C5a activity at the burn site, whereas neutrophil depletion was without effect. These data suggest that C5a activity may be related to oxygen products from xanthine oxidase. The catalase sensitivity and iron dependency of C5a generation suggest that hydroxyl radical may be related to complement activation and C5a appearance. This is the first report to directly link oxygen radical generation and complement activation in vivo.\r"

We have previously shown that increased mortality from a septic challenge correlated with impaired splenocyte interleukin-2 (IL-2) production and response to T cell mitogens in mice subjected to a 25% surface area scald burn. We report now that the addition of recombinant (r) IL-2 (100 U/ml) in vitro to splenocytes from burned animals restored mitogen responses to normal. Burned mice intraperitoneally received 16,000 U of rIL-2 (selected on the basis of dose-response experiments) once daily in 0.5 ml 5% dextrose (5% D) on days 1 through 6 after thermal injury and were compared with burned mice treated with only 5% D. Both groups were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture 10 days after burn; 4 days later, there were no survivors in the 5% D group, whereas 45% of the rIL-2 group remained alive (p = 0.001; Gehan statistic). We found that rIL-2 treatment at the dose selected resulted in no apparent toxicity in burned mice. Finally, splenocytes from rIL-2-treated burned mice showed improved responses to T cell mitogens in vitro compared with 5% D-treated controls. We conclude that rIL-2 therapy may have a role in the restoration of immune competence after thermal injury.\r"

Animals underwent aortic clamping and declamping alone (group I) or with implantation of an externally supported PTFE graft (group II) or preclotted knitted Dacron graft (group III). Fifteen minutes after declamping, mild activation of complement reflected as a fall in CH50 to 72% of preoperative baseline values was observed in group I animals. Comparatively greater activation was seen in group II (43% baseline) and group III (28% baseline) animals. The differences between groups I and II (p less than 0.05) and I and III (p less than 0.01) were significant. The drop in platelet count was greater in group II (66% baseline) and group III (53% baseline) animals compared with group I (86% baseline). Neutrophil counts decreased in group I animals (75% baseline), but, again, this fall was more marked in group II (35% baseline) and group III (43% baseline) animals. The difference between groups I and II was significant (p less than 0.05). Similarly, monocyte count decreased in group I animals (80% baseline), which was also more marked in group II (32% baseline) and group III (31% baseline) animals. The differences between group I and groups II and III were significant (p less than 0.05 for each). These trends persisted throughout the first postoperative hour. These results suggest that the blood-surface interactions produced systemic effects in vivo.\r"

To elucidate the underlying mechanism of interaction of IL-2, with its known ability to induce expansion of T lymphocytes, and IFN-alpha A/D, with its antiproliferative activity, we studied splenocytes from normal and tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice in 5-day cultures and measured proliferation by means of a standard 4-hour 3H-thymidine incorporation assay. Potent inhibition of IL-2-induced proliferation (usually greater than 90%) resulted from high concentrations of IFN (100 to 1000 U/ml). Splenocytes from both tumor-bearing and normal mice, cultured alone or with mitomycin-treated syngeneic tumor, MCA106, exhibited similar patterns of inhibition. Unexpectedly, allostimulation with DBA/2 (H-2d) stimulators and C57BL/6 (H-2b) responders showed enhanced proliferation, most pronounced at lower IFN concentrations. Time course of IFN action revealed minimal duration of exposure necessary for inhibition to be less than 24 hours. Microfluorometric cell analysis showed the striking increase in Thy-1+ cells (55% to 96%) induced by IL-2 with parallel increase in Lyt2+ cells but almost complete disappearance of L3T4+ cells. IFN reduced IL-2-induced increase in Lyt-2+ cells (61% to 31%). These results emphasize the complexity of IL-2 and IFN interaction and the potential for dose-related antagonistic effects. This may be important in the clinical use of this combination.\r"
