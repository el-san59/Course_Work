  ".W": "Many patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma have dyspnea or chest pain. Cardiac symptomatology is frequently difficult to differentiate from symptoms of pleuropulmonary disease. To better define the clinical characteristics of cardiac involvement in patients with mesothelioma, the electrocardiographic (EKG) and echocardiographic findings in 64 patients with biopsy-proven malignant pleural mesothelioma were reviewed. A total of 19/64 (30%) patients had autopsy studies available for review. The EKG was abnormal in 55 patients (89%). Over half (60%) had an arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia (42%), premature atrial and ventricular contractions (13%), atrial fibrillation (3%), and atrial flutter (1%). Over one third (37%) had a conduction abnormality, including bundle branch block (13%), hemiblock (8.5%), and incomplete right bundle branch block (13%). Echocardiography revealed a total of 13 patients with pericardial effusions, two with pericardial thickening, and one with an anterior sonolucent space. Of 19 autopsies, cardiac invasion was found in 14 (74%), with more than half to the pericardium and more than one quarter to the myocardium. It is concluded that: clinical cardiac abnormalities occur in the great majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, pathologic cardiac invasion occurs in the great majority of patients with pleural mesothelioma, and the EKG and echocardiogram are helpful in differentiating cardiac involvement from progressive pulmonary disease in patients with pleural mesothelioma.\r"

  ".W": "Simultaneous urinary flow cytometry, cytologic, and cystoscopic examinations were performed at 3-month intervals for a minimum of 1 year on 29 patients receiving intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment of superficial bladder carcinoma. Flow cytometry (FCM) and cytology were concordant in 57 of 103 examinations; both FCM and cytology were positive in 38 instances, and carcinoma was confirmed by biopsy in 35 (92.1%). In 16 instances FCM and cytology were negative, but carcinoma was present on biopsy in 5 (31.3%). Three examinations were suspicious by both techniques. The 46 determinations with discordant FCM and cytology were subdivided into pathologically confirmed recurrences (25 instances) and no evidence of pathologic and/or cystoscopic disease (21 instances). In the 25 instances of recurrences, FCM was positive in 18 (72.0%), suspicious in 3 (12.0%), and negative in 4 (16.0%), while cytology was positive in 3 (12.0%), suspicious in 9 (36.0%), and negative in 13 (52.0%). Most patients had a severe BCG-induced inflammatory response that caused an elevation of the hyperdiploid population, believed secondary to epithelial regeneration and proliferation. In the 21 instances without detectable recurrence, hyperploidy led to a relatively high proportion of positive (15) and suspicious (4) results by FCM, but only eight had distinct aneuploid populations. It is possible that this latter group, at least, is harboring occult carcinoma. Conventional cytology in the nonrecurrent group was positive in 1 (4.8%), suspicious in 7 (33.3%), and negative in 13 (61.9%). In those instances when tumor was confirmed by biopsy, the false-negative rate for FCM was 19.7%; the false-negative rate for cytology was 40.9%. Thus, FCM appears to be more sensitive but less specific than conventional cytology, having a lower false-negative but a higher false-positive rate. Although serial FCM provides an objective quantitative measure of aneuploid stemlines and hyperdiploid populations in bladder irrigation specimens and can be helpful in following intravesical BCG therapy for superficial bladder carcinoma, it should still be used with conventional cytology. The greatest difficulty with FCM at present, as with conventional cytology, is in cases of marked inflammation. The results reported here were obtained under the most stringent conditions and represent the minimum level of accuracy. Potential improvements in the technique, with the addition of immunologic or other markers, hold hope of further increasing the accuracy of FCM.\r"

Twenty-six of these patients had received 2000 rad within the week preceding surgery, and nine patients had received no preoperative treatment. The frequency of bladders without residual TCC was 23% for irradiated and 22% for nonirradiated cases. Of the TCCs classified as papillary in the biopsy specimens and irradiated, 79% lacked a papillary component at cystectomy, but in no case was the invasive component eliminated or regression from muscle invasion to superficial TCC noticed. Flat carcinoma in situ (CIS) did not respond to irradiation. At cystectomy nuclear pleomorphism was greater than at biopsy in 60% of the irradiated TCCs, whereas all nonirradiated cases retained the same grade as at biopsy. In addition, irradiation induced squamous differentiation in neoplastic cells only, without affecting the nonneoplastic urothelium.\r"

Even in disorders that primarily affect the left ventricle, the once-considered-passive conduit has proved essential for maintenance of normal cardiac output. In coronary artery disease, the function of the right ventricle is affected by both its circulation and the after-load placed on it by dysfunction of the left ventricle. In congestive heart failure, right ventricular function relates to functional capacity, whereas left ventricular function does not, and right ventricular ejection fraction is a useful prognostic guide in these patients. In mitral and aortic valvular disease, the role of the right ventricle is only now becoming evident, and the precise interplay of all factors has yet to be explained. In systemic hypertension, it is likely that the pulmonary circulation is affected by the same humoral factors that elevate systemic pressures.\r"

Little information is available regarding disproportionate dysfunction of the right ventricle associated with cardiac operation and the recovery period therefrom. Recognition of the problem is of paramount importance, if support measures are to be implemented. A great deal has yet to be learned regarding the appropriate support for the acutely failing right ventricle. Much remains to be accomplished regarding the assessment of right ventricle reserve, defining the role of risk factors, and quantitating the value of measures to optimally protect the right ventricle from injury during the perioperative period. Recognizing that the integrity of the right ventricle can be altered by numerous preoperative, perioperative and postoperative factors will provide an enlightened disposition on the part of the surgical team. Awareness of these considerations in the planning and conduct of surgical procedures should reduce morbidity and mortality from perioperative right ventricular failure. The imposition of new or unexpected morbidity during operation on a relatively unrelated problem represents surgical imperfection. Appropriate effort toward minimizing insult of the right ventricle could result in significantly decreasing the incidence and severity of perioperative right ventricular failure before the impetus of the continuing clinical problem dictates improvement in techniques to more appropriately treat this frequently preventable problem.\r"

  ".W": "When right ventricular failure prohibits separation from cardiopulmonary bypass, standard methods of increasing pulmonary blood flow should be employed, including correction of hypoxia and acidosis, volume loading, and inotropic support of the right ventricle. Infusion of pulmonary vasodilators--particularly low-dose nitroprusside--should be used if the pulmonary vascular resistance is elevated. If pulmonary blood flow remains unsatisfactory, systemic intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be employed. In refractory cases, right-atrial-to-pulmonary-artery bypass using the Bio-Medicus centrifugal pump is the recommended therapy for those centers that do not have the Pierce-Donachy pneumatic ventricular assist-pump available. For refractory right ventricular failure following the surgical repair of congenital cardiac defects in which the placement of right atrial and pulmonary artery cannulae is not technically feasible, use of high-frequency high-volume ventilation appears to be quite promising. Utilization of pulmonary artery counterpulsation or the creation of an atrial septal defect may also be lifesaving, but is not recommended as the therapy of choice.\r"

  ".U": "87051560\r", 
  ".W": "RV and LV failure frequently coexist. Experimental evidence suggests that RV failure results from a primary insult to the right ventricle and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. LV failure results in an elevation of the left atrial pressure and thereby a reduction in the transpulmonary hydrostatic gradient. Because RV function depends on the contraction of the left ventricle, this contribution is reduced during LV failure. Treatment should be aimed first at restoring LV function. If RV failure persists and is not due to a simple mechanical problem, treatment of RV failure should be commenced. If volume loading, inotropes, and pH adjustments do not result in adequate RV output, a mechanical assist device should be considered. RHBP is the most powerful device, and it is capable of restoring systemic perfusion even when there is no residual RV function. Clinical results with this device have been most encouraging--most patients demonstrate improved RV function and a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance after several days of treatment, allowing them to be weaned from assist. However, this technique is very invasive and requires constant close attention. PABC is a simple but less powerful assist device. Experimental studies suggest that if RV function is not extremely depressed--cardiac output is greater than 50 percent of normal--PABC may be effective in restoring systemic perfusion to normal levels. Current results suggest that RHBP remains the gold standard for severe RV failure, but further clinical experience with PABC may more clearly define its role in the management of RV failure.\r"

Blood flow velocity spectra across the aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid, and mitral valves were digitized to obtain peak velocities (m/sec) and flow velocity integrals. Aortic and pulmonary diameters were measured at valve level from two-dimensional echocardiographic images and cross-sectional area was calculated assuming a circular orifice. Ventricular stroke volume was calculated as the product of the cross-sectional area of a great vessel and the flow velocity integral through that vessel. The pulmonary arterial and aortic diameters increased linearly with gestational age (r = .82, r = .84), and pulmonary arterial diameter consistently exceeded aortic diameter. There was a positive relationship between stroke volume and gestational age: stroke volume increased exponentially from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 7.6 ml at 40 weeks for the right ventricle (r = .87) and from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 5.2 ml at 40 weeks for the left ventricle (r = .91). Similar results were obtained for right and left ventricular and combined cardiac outputs. In 44% of the fetuses it was possible to quantitate both right and left ventricular stroke volumes. There was a close correlation between right and left ventricular stroke volumes in these fetuses (r = .96) and right ventricular stroke volume exceeded left ventricular stroke volume by 28%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Only stenoses of less than 70% that were visualized in nearly identical projections on both angiograms were evaluated. Vessel edges were measured by use of catheter calibration and an automated computer algorithm yielding two \"absolute dimensions\" (mean and minimum diameters) and two measurements (percent stenosis and atheroma area) that required a \"normal reference\" diameter. The coefficient of variation for repeated segment measurements was less for mean and minimum diameter than for percent stenosis and area of atheroma. The best measure of progression of coronary disease as determined by t test comparison of different methods was the change in mean diameter over time (6.7 +/- 14.1% decrease), whether calculated on a per coronary segment or per patient basis (p less than .001). Based on this measurement and its standard deviation of progression of coronary disease in this patient subset with relatively benign disease, it is estimated that 470 patients per group would be required for an interventional study to demonstrate a 33% reduction in disease progression (207 patients for 50% reduction) at a 95% confidence level and 90% power.\r"

Overall, the incidence of resting angina was highest at night. All pacing results were positive (greater than or equal to 1.0 mm ST segment shift) and tended to be reproducible in nine patients, whereas some or all were negative in seven. Among all positive results, ischemic thresholds at night were significantly lower than those in the morning and in the afternoon (125 +/- 3 vs 138 +/- 3 and 139 +/- 2 beats/min, mean +/- SEM; p less than .005). In nine patients, 19 pacing tests produced ST segment elevation, of which 13 were performed at night (68%). We conclude that patients with resting angina and severe coronary stenosis often exhibit a nocturnal decline in their ischemic threshold, which seems to facilitate development of transmural ischemia during atrial pacing.\r"

It is not known, however, to what extent different stimuli can induce spasm in the same patient. To investigate whether coronary arterial spasm results from specific abnormal agonist-receptor interactions or from a local nonspecific coronary supersensitivity to different stimuli, 28 patients with vasospastic angina were submitted to a series of diverse vasoconstrictive stimuli known to provoke coronary spasm. Ergonovine, hyperventilation, handgrip, cold pressor, and exercise-tests, were carried out in all 28 patients. In the last 15 patients histamine was also administered. Spasm was provoked by ergonovine in 96% of patients, by hyperventilation in 54%, by histamine in 47%, by exercise in 46%, and by the cold pressor and handgrip tests in 11% and 7%, respectively. No significant differences were found in the responses to provocative tests of patients with normal coronary arteries or nonsignificant stenoses and those with significant lesions. In the same individual, spasm was induced by at least two vasoconstrictive stimuli, although with a different mechanism of action, in 82% of patients and spasm was induced by three or more stimuli in 39%. Tests were repeated in at least 23 patients and short-term reproducibility paralleled sensitivity. These results suggest that in patients with variant angina, a local nonspecific supersensitivity rather than an abnormal specific agonist-receptor interaction plays a major role in the genesis of coronary arterial spasm.\r"

During follow-up of up to 20 months (median 11), seven patients died suddenly and six presented again with spontaneous, symptomatic VT. Eleven of 65 (17%) group 1 patients had an arrhythmic event compared with one of 92 patients (1%) in group 2 (p less than .001). The sensitivity of the signal-averaged ECG as a predictor of arrhythmic events was 92% with a specificity of 62%. Patients with subsequent arrhythmic events had considerably lower voltage in the last 40 msec of the QRS (11.0 +/- 8.3 vs 32.0 +/- 21.9 microV; p less than .001) than those without such events, and longer filtered QRS complexes (121 +/- 14 vs 105 +/- 12 msec; p less than .001). Multivariate logistic regression determined that the signal-averaged ECG provided independent prognostic information from the presence of complex ventricular ectopy and the degree of left ventricular dysfunction assessed at the time of hospital discharge. Signal-averaged ECGs provide important prognostic information in identifying patients at risk of arrhythmic events after myocardial infarction. Dynamic changes in the terminal QRS voltage are observed during the first year after myocardial infarction.\r"

Specific ICYP binding in a crude, high-yield membrane preparation derived from endomyocardial biopsy tissue was high (specificity greater than 90%), of high affinity (KD around 20 pM), saturable and stereospecific for the (-) vs the (+) isomer of isoproterenol. Subjects with mild-moderate and severe biventricular dysfunction had respective decreases in beta-adrenergic receptor density of 38.2% and 57.7% when normalization methods were averaged, with no significant differences in ICYP dissociation constant. A subgroup of subjects was subdivided by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) into those with mild cardiac dysfunction (LVEF less than 0.50 greater than 0.40) and severe heart failure (LVEF less than 0.20) and given graded sequential infusions of dobutamine and calcium gluconate. Those with severe cardiac dysfunction had marked impairment of the dobutamine dP/dt and stroke work index response, whereas these responses to calcium did not differ in the two groups. These data indicate that in the intact human heart endomyocardial biopsy may be used for direct analysis of beta-adrenergic receptors, heart failure-associated myocardial beta-adrenergic down-regulation begins with mild-moderate ventricular dysfunction, reduction in myocardial beta-receptor density is related to degree of heart failure, and beta-receptor down-regulation is associated with pharmacologically specific impairment of the beta-agonist-mediated contractile response.\r"

Twenty-five patients with severe symptoms and ejection fractions of 25% or less were studied to determine the lowest ventricular filling pressures that could be achieved with vasodilator and diuretic therapy while maintaining cardiac output. In 20 of 25 patients normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWs) were achieved (mean 10 mm Hg compared with 30 mm Hg at baseline). Stroke volume was 60 vs 39 ml at baseline. Stroke work index was 30 vs 19 g-m/m2. For each patient, over the range of PCWs, stroke volume and stroke work index were maintained and were often maximal at the lowest PCW achieved. The upright position was well tolerated in patients with normal supine PCW. Normal filling pressures can be achieved in patients with congestive heart failure without compromise of cardiac output. While congestive symptoms should be improved, the feasibility and benefit of maintaining normal filling pressures over a long term must be established.\r"

Therefore we tested ESS/ESVI together with standard hemodynamic variables as possible predictors of outcome in 39 patients with various valvular lesions who underwent valve replacement. Thirteen patients had preoperative mitral regurgitation, 16 had aortic stenosis, nine had aortic regurgitation, and one had mitral stenosis. Twenty-seven patients (group S) had a satisfactory outcome as defined by a return to NYHA class I or II together with a normal postoperative ejection fraction. Twelve patients who died, remained in class III or IV, or had a subnormal postoperative ejection fraction were deemed to have an unsatisfactory result (group U). Mean right atrial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index (ESVI), and end-systolic wall stress were all greater in group U, whereas ESS/ESVI and ejection fraction were lower in group U. When these and other factors were submitted to stepwise discriminant multivariate analysis, ESS/ESVI and ESVI were the only independent predictors of outcome. However, when patients with mitral regurgitation (who might have biased the study) were excluded, discriminant analysis showed ESVI as the only independent predictive variable. We conclude that end-systolic indicators of ventricular function are superior to other standard hemodynamic variables in predicting outcome of valve replacement.\r"

However, muscular or multiple ventricular septal defects may be difficult to diagnose with noninvasive methods, particularly in older children, necessitating angiography for accurate diagnosis. Detection of single and multiple ventricular septal defects with two-dimensional color flow mapping was compared with detection by standard two-dimensional imaging and Doppler. Both techniques were compared with four-chamber left ventricular angiography. Fifty-one patients (age 3 months to 25 years, mean 5.6 years) were studied. Eighteen had solitary ventricular septal defects, 18 had multiple ventricular septal defects, and 15 patients with intact ventricular septum served as a control group. At least one ventricular septal defect was detected by color Doppler and two-dimensional/Doppler methods in all patients with ventricular septal defect proved by angiography with no false positives. In the detection of multiple ventricular septal defects, the sensitivity of color Doppler was 72% and that of two-dimensional/Doppler was 38% (100% specificity in both). Color Doppler failed to identify multiple ventricular septal defects in five patients (two weighing less than 4 kg and three with reduced pulmonary blood flow). However, no large additional muscular defects were missed by imaging and color Doppler. Color Doppler is useful for the detection of ventricular septal defects and has higher sensitivity than two-dimensional/Doppler for multiple ventricular septal defects. The contribution of color Doppler appears to be in the detection of additional small muscular ventricular septal defects.\r"

The latter had old myocardial infarction and no conduction disturbances and had not been receiving antiarrhythmic drugs. In both normal subjects and patients with VT, isopotential maps of the time-averaged and filtered (25 Hz high-pass) electrocardiograms during the terminal portion of the QRS were dipolar, i.e., they showed single positive and negative regions. For patients with VT, the extrema were either distant, with one over the precordial area and the other over the back, or close together in the precordial region. In 10 patients, maps recorded after administration of antiarrhythmic drugs remained the same while QRS duration was prolonged. In six patients, maps recorded before antiarrhythmic surgery showed distant extrema for septal or posterobasal VT sites of origin and close extrema for anterior or posteroapical sites. Generally, QRS duration was reduced and maps were modified after surgery. Late potentials can be well detected with only three orthogonal leads because their distributions are dipolar, but maps provide additional information about their distribution, which may be related to conduction delay sites and possibly to VT sites of origin. Sources near the torso surface would produce close extrema, whereas deeper sources would produce distant extrema.\r"

  ".W": "Body surface potential maps were recorded from 140 chest leads in 25 patients affected by the idiopathic long QT syndrome (LQTS) and in 25 healthy control subjects matched for age and sex. Potential time integrals of the QRST and ST-T intervals were calculated at each lead point and displayed as isointegral (ISOI) maps. The main abnormalities noted on the QRST and ST-T ISOI maps were one area of negative values larger than normal in the right anterior and inferior thorax and a complex multipeak distribution of the integral values. At least one abnormality was present in 19 (76%) of the patients with LQTS and four (16%) of the control subjects (p less than .001). Each ISOI map was also represented as a weighted sum of nine fundamental components (eigenvectors) to detect and quantitate the nondipolar content. The percent contribution of the nondipolar eigenvectors (all eigenvectors beyond the third) was significantly higher in the LQTS group than in the control group (p less than .005). Specifically, an abnormally high nondipolar content on the QRST ISOI maps was observed much more frequently for patients with LQTS than for control subjects (nine or 36% vs one or 4%), and this was also true on the ST-T ISOI maps (14 or 56% vs one or 4%). No correlation was found between the major abnormalities on body surface maps and syncopal episodes. However, the high prevalence (76%) of these alterations among the patients with LQTS and their infrequent occurrence in the control population strongly suggests that they may be useful markers for the diagnosis of atypical cases. The prominent electronegative area on the anterior thorax can be related to delayed repolarization of a portion of the anterior wall of the heart. This finding is in agreement with the hypothesis that lower than normal right cardiac sympathetic activity is the main pathogenetic mechanism of LQTS. Multipeak distribution and high nondipolar content suggest regional electrical disparities in the ventricular recovery process. This may in part account for the high susceptibility of patients with LQTS to malignant arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Guiding surgical therapy of ventricular tachycardia by preoperative endocardial catheter mapping necessitates improvement of the accuracy of localization of the arrhythmogenic site. We therefore used a new mathematical cineradiographic method during catheter mapping to compute the position of left ventricular arrhythmogenic sites relative to three anatomic reference points: the centers of aortic and mitral valve ostia and the left ventricular apex. To enable the surgeon to identify the position of the computed sites, a wire skeleton (one for each patient) representing a single or multiple arrhythmogenic site(s) relative to the anatomic reference points was constructed. This wire skeleton was inserted into the left ventricular cavity during surgery. Side branches of the device indicated preoperatively localized arrhythmogenic sites. Results in eight consecutive patients were compared with those of intraoperative simultaneous mapping of 64 endocardial sites. Sixteen morphologically distinct monomorphic ventricular tachycardias were mapped by catheter and 15 by intraoperative mapping. In 12 ventricular tachycardias an identical morphology was recorded during both techniques. The distance between arrhythmogenic sites localized with both methods was 1 cm or less in 11 of these 12 ventricular tachycardias and 2 cm in one ventricular tachycardia. These results indicate that endocardial catheter mapping combined with wire skeleton representation of computed positions of arrhythmogenic sites is reliable for guiding surgical therapy of ventricular tachycardia and since some of the ventricular tachycardias were inducible only during either preoperative or intraoperative mapping, both techniques have an additive value. In addition, the wire skeleton proved convenient during surgery by identifying the arrhythmogenic sites.\r"

  ".W": "The short-term effects of incremental doses of procainamide (7.5, 15, 22.5, and 30 mg/kg) on right ventricular effective refractory period, intraventricular conduction, and induction of ventricular tachycardia were determined in 31 patients who had a history of sustained, unimorphic ventricular tachycardia. QRS duration during incremental ventricular pacing was used as an index of rate-dependent changes in intraventricular conduction. The mean plasma procainamide concentrations corresponding to the incremental doses were 5.5 +/- 1.2 (+/- SD), 9.0 +/- 1.6, 12.6 +/- 2.2, and 16.3 +/- 3.2 mg/liter. Each incremental dose of procainamide up to a dose of 30 mg/kg resulted in a significant increment in right ventricular effective refractory period and each dose up to 22.5 mg/kg potentiated a rate-dependent prolongation of QRS duration. After the 7.5 mg/kg dose of procainamide, induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in eight of 31 patients. After higher doses of procainamide, induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in two additional patients. In three of 10 patients in whom the induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed by 7.5, 15, or 22.5 mg/kg of procainamide, sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after a higher dose of procainamide. In three of 31 patients, only nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was inducible after a 7.5 to 22.5 mg/kg dose of procainamide; however, in two of these three patients, sustained ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after administration of a higher dose of procainamide. In conclusion, during electropharmacologic testing with procainamide, it is worthwhile to test a dose of 7.5 mg/kg, because this dose is often effective in patients who respond to this drug. However, the results of this study indicate that procainamide may be effective in suppressing the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia at a relatively low plasma concentration, but not at a higher plasma concentration. Therefore, during long-term therapy with procainamide it may be important to avoid plasma procainamide concentrations not only lower, but also higher than the concentration that results in the suppression of induction of tachycardia.\r"

Forty-five patients were refractory to pharmacologic treatment; eight were initially stabilized but once again became symptomatic with light exertion. Angioplasty was performed in 35 patients 2 to 14 days and in 18 patients 15 to 30 days after infarction (average 12 +/- 7 days after infarction). The initial success rate was 89% (47/53). The success rate of the patients treated at 2 to 14 days was lower (29/35, 83%) than that of patients treated at 14 to 30 days (18/18, 100%) but did not reach statistical significance (p less than .06). There were no deaths related to the procedure. In four of the six failures, emergency bypass surgery was performed and two patients sustained a myocardial infarction. Furthermore, a myocardial infarction complicated the angioplasty procedure in two other patients; thus the overall procedure-related myocardial infarction rate was 8% (4/53). At 6 months follow-up 26% (14/53) of all the patients who underwent angioplasty had recurrence of angina, which was successfully treated with repeat angioplasty, bypass surgery, or medical therapy. There were no late deaths. Late myocardial infarction occurred in two patients. Thus the total myocardial infarction rate after angioplasty at 6 months was 11% (6/53 patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To identify angiographic characteristics of coronary stenoses that may affect the incidence of these complications, the diagnostic pre-PTCA coronary angiograms of 38 consecutive patients (group I) undergoing emergency coronary surgery for dissection or occlusion were reviewed and compared with the angiograms of a random sample of 38 patients (stratified for left anterior descending and right coronary arteries) from a group of 1151 who did not need emergency coronary surgery (group II). Stenosis morphology before angioplasty was considered \"complicated\" if at least one of the following criteria was present: irregular borders, intraluminal lucency, and localization of stenosis in curve or at bifurcation. Baseline characteristics, maximum inflation pressures, types of balloon catheters used, and routinely registered angiographic stenosis properties (severity, length, eccentricity, and calcification) were similar in both groups. Irregular borders before PTCA were present in 22 of 38 patients in group I vs 10 of 38 in group II (p less than .05), intraluminal lucency in 22 of 38 vs nine of 38 (p less than .05), localization in curve in 27 of 38 pts vs 16 of 38 (p less than .05), and localization at bifurcation in 11 of 38 vs 15 of 38 (NS). Complicated angiographic morphology of coronary stenosis may represent a risk factor for dissection or occlusion. Therefore, although the predictive value of these findings is low, detailed evaluation of angiographic morphology of coronary stenoses may improve patient selection and reduce complication rates of PTCA.\r"

Early thrombolytic therapy with intracoronary streptokinase (152 patients) or with intracoronary streptokinase preceded by intravenous streptokinase (117 patients) was compared with conventional treatment (264 patients). All 533 patients were admitted to the coronary care unit within 4 hr after onset of symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction. Four hundred eighty-eight patients were eligible for this detailed analysis, and 245 of these were allocated to thrombolytic therapy and 243 to conventional treatment. Early angiographic examinations were performed in 212 patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy. Patency of the infarct-related artery was achieved in 181 patients (85%). Enzymatic infarct size, as measured from cumulative alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase release, was smaller in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (median 760 vs 1170 U/liter in control patients, p = .0001). Left ventricular ejection fraction measured by radionuclide angiography before discharge from the hospital was higher after thrombolytic therapy (median 50% vs 43% in control patients, p = .0001). Three month mortality was lower in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (6% vs 14% in the control group, p = .006). With the use of multivariate regression analysis, infarct size limitation, improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, and three month mortality were predicted by sum of the ST segment elevation, time from onset of symptoms to admission, and Killip class at admission. Thrombolysis was most effective in patients admitted within 2 hr after onset of symptoms and in patients with a sum of ST segment elevation of 1.2 mV or more. On the other hand, no beneficial effects of streptokinase on enzymatic infarct size, left ventricular function, or mortality were observed in the subset of patients with a sum of ST segment elevation of less than 1.2 mV who were admitted between 2 and 4 hr after onset of symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial and cerebral blood flow can be generated during cardiac arrest by techniques that manipulate intrathoracic pressure. Augmentation of intrathoracic pressure by high-pressure ventilation simultaneous with compression of the chest in dogs has been shown to produce higher flows to the heart and brain, but has limited usefulness because of the requirement for endotracheal intubation and complex devices. A system was developed that can produce high intrathoracic pressure without simultaneous ventilation by use of a pneumatically cycled vest placed around the thorax (vest cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]). The system was first tested in a short-term study of the maximum achievable flows during arrest. Peak vest pressures up to 380 mm Hg were used on eight 21 to 30 kg dogs after induction of ventricular fibrillation and administration of epinephrine. Microsphere-determined myocardial blood flow was 108 +/- 17 ml/min/100 g (100 +/- 16% of prearrest flow) and cerebral flow was 51 +/- 12 ml/min/100 g (165 +/- 39% of prearrest). Severe lung or liver trauma was noted in three of eight dogs. If peak vest pressure was limited to 280 mm Hg, however, severe trauma was no longer observed. A study of the hemodynamics during and survival from prolonged resuscitation was then performed on three groups of seven dogs. Vest CPR was compared with manual CPR with either conventional (300 newtons) or high (430 newtons) sternal force. After induction of ventricular fibrillation, each technique was performed for 26 min. Defibrillation was then performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Newer nonionic contrast agents have been shown to have fewer adverse hemodynamic, inotropic, and rheologic effects compared with ionic media and it has been suggested that they might not substantially affect coronary blood flow. Six dogs were instrumented with electromagnetic flow probes and subendocardial ultrasonic crystals. Intracoronary injections of iohexol (300 mg/ml iodine) were administered to establish a relationship between the dose and rate of contrast injection and the effect on flow and regional myocardial function. Two and 4 ml volumes of iohexol were injected at 3 ml/sec; 4 ml volumes were administered at 1 and 4 ml/sec. The 2 and 4 ml volumes decreased coronary flow by a mean of 31% (p less than .01) and 77% (p less than .001). The 4 ml injection at 1 and 4 ml/sec 77% (p less than .001) and 69% (p less than .001). The magnitude of the fall in flow was directly related to the dose, and the rate at which the flow nadir was attained was directly related to the rate of injection. Decrements in fractional shortening were temporally delayed by several beats compared with the flow changes and showed mean decrements of 19% to 29%. The effects on regional myocardial function were independent of contrast volume. However, the degree of dysfunction was more profound with slower infusion rates, suggesting that prolongation of contrast-induced ischemia was a major modulating factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine the importance of reperfusion injury and the ability of the free-radical scavenger recombinant human superoxide dismutase (h-SOD) to prevent it, open-chest dogs underwent 90 min of proximal circumflex coronary artery occlusion, and only at the moment of reperfusion received either h-SOD (400,000 IU bolus into the left atrium followed by a 300,000 IU iv infusion over 1 hr) or saline. After 48 hr the surviving animals were killed and measurements were made of the risk region (by postmortem angiography) and infarct size (by gross pathology). All measurements were made by investigators blinded to treatment given, and the code was broken only at the end of the study. Hemodynamic variables and collateral flow during ischemia were similar in the two groups. Infarct size in control animals (n = 8) averaged 22.4 +/- 3.1% of the left ventricle and 52.2 +/- 7.1% of the risk region, compared with 13.3 +/- 0.8% of the left ventricle and 33.6 +/- 2.1% of the risk region in h-SOD-treated dogs (n = 8) (p less than .05). Infarcts in treated animals were not only smaller, but also exhibited a distinctive \"patchiness,\" suggesting protection along vascular distributions. Furthermore, analysis of the relationship between infarct size and collateral flow measured during ischemia in the two groups indicated that protection by h-SOD was greatest in animals with the lowest collateral flows. This study supports the concept that reperfusion of ischemic myocardium results in a separate component of cell damage, presumably linked to the generation of oxygen free radicals on reflow. Since the h-SOD preventable reperfusion component of injury was most pronounced in hearts with the most severe ischemia, scavenging of oxygen radicals at the time of reflow may offer a novel and particularly promising therapeutic approach for the protection of ischemic myocardium.\r"

Twenty-two dogs underwent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). In 10 dogs (group I) the LAD remained occluded for 3 hr and in the other 12 (group II) for 2 hr followed by 1 hr of reperfusion. Gd-DTPA (0.34 mM/kg) was administered to five dogs in group I at 2 hr and 5 min after occlusion and to seven dogs in group II 5 min after reperfusion. At 3 hr after ligation, the hearts were excised and imaged with spin echo and inversion recovery pulse sequences on a 0.35 Tesla magnetic resonance imager. Reperfused hearts given Gd-DTPA demonstrated a significant increase in contrast between normal and reperfused myocardium as compared with nonreperfused hearts and reperfused hearts not given Gd-DTPA. This enhancement was particularly prominent in the inversion recovery images. Studies performed in vivo in two additional dogs demonstrated similar enhancement with reperfusion with Gd-DTPA in gated spin echo images. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging allows the detection of reperfusion early in the course of acute infarction.\r"

The event that compromises the cardiac status is often respiratory embarrassment, and the presenting rhythms are often bradyarrhythmias and asystole. Emergency medical services (EMS) systems have primarily an adult focus and may not be organized to manage optimally the critically ill and injured child. Data from a survey of training programs demonstrate that paramedic and EMT education in pediatric emergencies may be inadequate. Forty-one percent of the programs surveyed had less than 10 hr of pediatric training. Data suggest that EMS providers may not be equipped to manage children effectively. The Los Angeles EMS System for children is described. There are two levels of receiving facilities: Emergency Departments Approved for Pediatrics and Pediatric Critical Care Centers. The system is voluntary and has 85% of the hospitals in compliance with the guidelines. Early recognition of the prearrest state, improved training, and equipping of prehospital care personnel, development of EMS services for children, dissemination of an advanced pediatric life support course, as well as research in pediatric CPR may improve the outcome of resuscitation in the pediatric population.\r"

However, special consideration must be given to the development of such services in small communities, chiefly because of problems associated with the low volume of true emergency calls. Communities considering implementing programs by which defibrillation is performed by the emergency medical technician (EMT-D) must first evaluate their ambulance response times and, if inadequate, alter their system of ambulance response. After implementation of such a program, a permanent, formal skill maintenance program must be established. Defibrillation protocols must allow for the fact that many patients will refibrillate after successful conversion, yet no advanced care beyond the defibrillator will generally be available. Finally, every community instituting an EMT-D program must maintain a system of monitoring EMT performance and patient outcome that documents acceptable survival-to-discharge rates as well as the safety of the program. For smaller communities a regional or statewide evaluation system may be preferable to individual community programs.\r"

To overcome some of the fear and lack of involvement, better education strategies are needed. Adults learn didactic information through understanding and skills through repetition and reinforcement. Due to the fact that there is limited time that adults will commit to learning CPR, methods of simplification of the techniques need to be used so that there can be sufficient repetition and reinforcement. Teaching two-rescuer CPR to lay rescuers should not routinely be done. Most adults, particularly those around high-risk individuals, should learn one-rescuer CPR. Infant resuscitation should be taught predominantly to those around small children. Methods of reinforcement through the mass media should be attempted on a routine basis. Whenever possible the courses should be spread over a period of time to allow for repetition and reinforcement, thereby maximizing learning. Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) should be widely taught to health professionals. ACLS instruction needs to be spread over time, whenever logistically possible, to enhance learning and retention. Good, validated examinations are needed and should be routinely rotated. Better methods of evaluation are needed to look at the benefit of these types of programs and to improve the cost-benefit ratio.\r"

After aspiration of either fresh or seawater, a large intrapulmonary physiologic shunt can occur, which requires aggressive mechanical ventilatory support to ensure adequate oxygenation and to return pulmonary function to normal. Near drowning is a multisystem disease and, while abnormalities of the lung and brain have been emphasized, definitive therapy must be tailored to each patient and must address all of the patient's needs.\r"

  ".W": "Over the last two decades, emergency medical services in the United States have been greatly improved. Organization of prehospital providers of health care has improved the outcome of many patients, particularly the trauma patient and the acute cardiac patient. In Seattle as many as 40% of outside-the-hospital cardiac arrest victims with ventricular fibrillation have been saved when there is rapid delivery of basic life support by first responders followed by advanced life support by paramedics. Although these systems are growing and improving health care, many lack adequate medical control or physician involvement. Emergency medical service systems must have physicians involved in their management to meet their full capabilities. It has become apparent that four factors are critical in determining the ability to resuscitate an individual once a cardiac arrest has occurred: time to starting any of the rescue procedures, use of electrical defibrillation when indicated, use of epinephrine, and adequacy of the technique of basic life support, particularly the ventilation component. To provide defibrillation at the earliest possible time, defibrillation by first responders such as emergency medical technicians appears to be of benefit. With the advent of automatic and semiautomatic defibrillators, first responders and family members may also be able to defibrillate victims. The use of defibrillation by people with less training than paramedics, however, must be approached with caution to ensure that there is adequate medical control and that the individuals who use these devices are properly trained.\r"

  ".U": "87052097\r", 
  ".W": "The ability of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to provide adequate vital organ blood flow during prolonged resuscitation has long been questioned, as has the mechanism of blood flow during CPR. Because coughing during cardiac arrest has been shown to produce adequate anterograde flow to maintain consciousness in man without compressing the heart, cough CPR has been used as a model of a pure \"thoracic pump\" mechanism on which to base modifications of CPR. In the thoracic pump mechanism, the left heart is a passive conduit for blood expressed from the pulmonary vasculature to the aorta, and there is selective flow to the brachiocephalic vascular bed because of its low pressure veins, which are protected by closure of thoracic inlet venous valves. Right heart flow from systemic veins to the lungs occurs between applications of pressure. Four alternative modalities exploiting the thoracic pump concept were studied in dogs during ventricular fibrillation with angiographic and pressure recordings: cough CPR, simultaneous chest compression and lung inflation, abdominal compression with lung inflation, and inflation of a vest and binder. The latter technique was associated with successful defibrillation and recovery after more than 30 min of circulatory support during ventricular fibrillation. Preliminary studies in a primate preparation indicate that this technique might be useful for prolonged circulatory support in man when defibrillation is not initially available or successful.\r"

This article briefly summarizes 5 years of investigation by our group on hemodynamic support during external cardiac massage. In most studies, long-term canine preparations were used, and implanted transducers allowed precise hemodynamic measurements. Although cardiac output was depressed with all CPR methods, manual chest compressions of high velocity, moderate force, and brief duration at a rate of 120/min seemed to optimize systemic and coronary blood flow. This method was termed high-impulse CPR. High-impulse techniques now have been applied extensively in the clinical setting, and preliminary observations also support their efficacy in man. Based on this experience, it is suggested that the American Heart Association guidelines be changed to recommend a manual chest compression rate of 120/min during closed-chest cardiac massage.\r"

These models have analyzed, among other variables, kinetic energy and inertial and aerodynamic forces in attempts to focus on specific aspects of this controversy. Human volunteers, anesthetized and paralyzed patients, and cadavers have also been used. In several recent studies it was concluded that subdiaphragmatic pressure is the treatment of choice, while in at least one additional study firm back blows applied with the patient's head hanging downward were recommended as the treatment most likely to relieve airway obstruction. It seems likely that these apparently conflicting views can be reconciled and that a consensus recommendation for treatment of this emergency can be effected.\r"

These studies show that gastric insufflation followed by regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration are a major hazard of artificial ventilation with an unprotected airway. Present BLS-CPR standards require that ventilation be performed rapidly between external chest compressions or with incremental breaths. These methods of ventilation predispose the victim to gastric insufflation. Alternative methods of ventilation with longer inspiratory time and thus lower flow rate and peak inspiratory pressure are suggested. Additionally, rescue personnel, particularly EMTs and paramedics, should be taught how to apply cricoid pressure to prevent gastric insufflation in victims with an unprotected airway.\r"

EMT-D programs have been shown effective in urban, suburban, and rural communities with and without paramedic backup. EMT-D programs appear safe, with errors of commission being extremely rare and errors of omission being of acceptably low incidence. Issues still to be resolved include the degree and amount of training that should be given and whether manual or automatic defibrillators should be used. Medical supervision and quality control is the most important aspect of EMT-D programs. At its core, the success of EMT-D programs is confirmation of the principle of early defibrillation. Wider dissemination of early defibrillation will improve survival from sudden cardiac death.\r"

This value of flow per unit area corresponded to values expected at the level of the nostril during quiet breathing. A series of 6 subjects were asked to breathe over a flexible liquid crystal film regularly during the day and the area of colour change produced by flow from each nostril was examined. Four subjects showed a regular change in relative flow through each nostril whilst 2 subjects showed a constant flow through each nostril. This simple and non-invasive technique provides a method of examining the nasal cycle in adults and children in health and disease.\r"

Different events were photographed by taking 'stills' from the television monitor during play-back. Outgrowths from both tumour and normal explants formed only as monolayers. Mitoses were mainly found to be localized approximately mid-way between explant and the edge of the outgrowth. Some cells were seen to become suddenly active producing oscillating blebs and sometimes they detached themselves from the monolayer culture and changed appearance. This was more prevalent in the tumour cultures. In both tumour and normal cell cultures lymphocytes were observed and their normal chemokinetic movement was changed into a rapid chemotactic attraction by the presence of a mitotic epithelial cell. These lymphocytes appear to represent T-suppressor cells. The present study has shown that primary tissue culture can be a valuable tool in the study of laryngeal carcinoma. The interaction between mitotic tumour cells and lymphocytes may represent a transformation of T-lymphocytes into LAK cells.\r"

Static cytofluorometry was performed on smears removed at microlaryngoscopy from 107 vocal cord lesions (96 patients). All stem cell lines were diploid except 3; 2 carcinomas and 1 severe dysplasia were polyploid. The mean proliferative activity (percentage of nuclei greater than diploid peak) was 2.1% for the group of epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia, 3.1% for those with moderate dysplasia, 4.0% for severe dysplasia, and 6.8% for carcinomas. Hypertetraploid cell nuclei (HT cells) were not found in epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia. Seven out of 15 patients with epithelia showing moderate dysplasia had HT cells; 5 of these patients developed a carcinoma. One of 8 without HT cells developed a severe dysplasia. Nine patients with severe dysplasia had HT cells; 4 had recurrences and 4 developed carcinoma within 4 years. In 14 patients without HT cells, 3 had recurrences and 1 developed a carcinoma 6 years later. HT cells were found in 15 patients with T1 & T2 carcinomas; residual carcinoma was present in 2 after radiotherapy and 4 had recurrences within 11 months. Fourteen patients with T1 & T2 carcinoma did not have any HT cells; one had residual carcinoma after radiotherapy and 3 had recurrences between 18 months and 4 years. DNA measurements and, especially, the demonstration of epithelia with HT cells prove to be of prognostic importance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have carried out a study of the fine structure of the respiratory nasal mucosa in man and in the cat using the techniques described by Jabonero, Champy Maillet and Koelle-Friedenwald. The most striking finding was the presence of microganglia deep within the mucosa of the inferior turbinate close to the glands. These microganglia were cholinergic in nature since they demonstrated a positive reaction to anticholinesterase. From this we deduce that the nasal parasympathetic pathway has its postganglionic neurones not only in the pterygopalatine ganglion but also in these microganglia of the inferior turbinate. Each of four groups of cats were submitted to different techniques, including administration of neostigmine, inferior turbinectomy and Vidian neurectomy. Resection of the microganglia by means of turbinectomy reduced the hypersecretion caused by neostigmine and this was most noticeable when a Vidian neurectomy was carried out in addition.\r"

Casts were present in the urine from 2-11 hours after administration of the diuretic. Cast formation occurred in acidic urine and was prevented by alkalinization of the urine with potassium citrate. Animal studies showed that crystallization and cast formation occurred in the medullary and papillary collecting ducts of the rat kidney.

The intraperitoneal heparin concentration decreased linearily from 1.78 U/ml to 1.13 U/ml during a 4-hour dwell time. The antithrombin III-concentration increased to 0.56 +/- 0.1 mg/dl, reaching 1.87% of normal plasma values. The antithrombin III-portion of total protein was 0.62% in plasma and 0.79% in dialysate. The fibrinopeptide A-concentration, a specific product of thrombin action on fibrinogen was 37.1 +/- 11.8 ng/ml in plasma (normal range: less than 2.5 ng/ml) and 153.4 +/- 16.8 ng/ml in dialysate during regular CAPD. After the addition of 5000 U heparin the fibrinopeptide A-concentration in dialysate decreased to 11.6 +/- 2.6 ng/ml during a 4-hour dwell time. In vitro experiments showed no remarkable inhibition of fibrin formation by heparin without antithrombin III in dialysate. We suggest that the fibrinopeptide A is produced intraperitoneally and the antithrombin III-concentration in dialysate is sufficient to inhibit the fibrin formation after acceleration by heparin.\r"

Controls had no spinal deformity and underwent identical test procedures. The test results showed that scoliotic subjects had significant asymmetry between right and left limbs in their threshold for detection of joint motion (p less than or equal to 0.005) and in their ability to reproduce angles to which their elbow joint had been previously positioned (p less than or equal to 0.025). Slight asymmetry also was observed in the reproduction tests of the control group (p less than or equal to 0.013); however, there was no significant asymmetry seen in this group for the threshold test. Performance of bilateral limbs was designated good and bad for both groups; the limb that performed better in proprioceptive function was designated good limb. Analysis of data showed that the scoliotics' good and bad limbs performed inferiorly in both threshold and angle reproduction tests when compared with normal controls. The results of this study imply, but do not localize, a neurologic deficit in scoliotic patients.\r"

It may be introduced closed, using the image intensifier. Two groups of patients were evaluated: Group I was treated with the Inyo nail and Group II was treated by the Association For the Study of Internal Fixation (ASIF) technique. Eighty-five percent of the patients in Group I were rated as good, compared with 63% in Group II. There was significantly less morbidity and complications in Group I. Several factors must be observed in the treatment of ankle fractures. Stress radiographs must be obtained intraoperative. Surgery may be indicated in unstable supination lateral rotation Type II injuries, if these occur in patients with high physical demands. Anatomic reduction of the lateral malleolus must be obtained. Early weight-bearing and motion produces the best result. Late reconstruction of malunions can be accomplished using the Inyo nail.\r"

Patients with residual pain had patellofemoral incongruity but since two-thirds of the patients with incongruity were asymptomatic, incongruity alone may not be the cause of the symptoms. There was no positive correlation to muscular strength or range of movement. Nevertheless, exact adaptation of the patellar tendon and periarticular tissue seems necessary to obtain correct patello-femoral articulation. Reinforcement of the tendon with a wire cerclage is recommended to decrease the tension on the suture line and the consequent risk of a secondary rupture. In acute ruptures of the quadriceps tendon end-to-end sutures are sufficient.\r"

The precision of guided drilling was superior to that of free-hand drilling in positioning the ligament in the correct anatomic place.\r"

Two were found in whom proximal patella migration could be correlated (r = 0.85) with femoral growth rate. This was significant at the p = 0.01 level. Girls had a higher correlation of patella height to growth rate than boys. In certain cases, patella alta is an acquired rather than inherited condition; this supports the theory that overgrowth during the growth spurt can lead to patella alta in some individuals.\r"

To perform the Lachman test correctly, the anterior tibial force must be applied posteromedially on the proximal tibia. This is best achieved by having the leg under examination on the same side of the bed as the examiner, and with slight external tibial rotation. Reaching across the bed to examine either leg can create either false positive or false negative Lachman results due to inadvertent tibial rotation (internal tibial rotation decreases translation) and inaccurate comparisons of the injured and normal legs. The importance of tibial rotation must be recognized if the Lachman test is to be used reliably and with maximum sensitivity.\r"

Ender nails can be passed without difficulty past a compression hip screw and the bicortical plating screws. The hip and femur can be fixed internally through a single approach in a single position. Sliding compression hip screw devices can provide excellent preliminary stable femoral neck fixation. Blood supply to the femoral head is not disturbed while the femoral intramedullary fixation is performed. Antegrade Ender nailing avoids the common knee complications associated with other retrograde techniques. Decreased operative time, less blood loss, less technical difficulty, and early mobilization are important factors in the multiple-injured patient. Femoral intramedullary fixation may require open reduction, circlerage to ensure stability, and maintenance of alignment in case of significant comminution to allow early crutch ambulation. This mode of fixation may be advantageous for selected cases.\r"

The THA was revised 13 years after implantation. Thirty millimeters of calcar resorption was noted radiographically. Evidence of stem bending was present on examination of the femoral implant, and marked wear of the acetabular cup was noted. The pathologic evaluation of removed calcar bone and cement revealed a histiocytic mass invading the bone. Intracellular and extracellular polymethylene debris was noted within the invasive mass. Evidence of fragmented methylmethacrylate cement was also present. The bone-cement interface in the excised calcar region contained segments that showed active bone remodelling around the cement without an interposed membrane. It is possible that this case of calcar resorption began with histiocytic activation and recruitment by polyethylene wear debris followed by active bone lysis. The process may be perpetuated by the fragmentation of cement, as motion occurred at the calcar bone-cement interface, and may represent an extreme example of a process occurring in cases of calcar resorption in general.\r"

This latter deformity is associated with mild slipped capital femoral epiphysis (recognized or unrecognized at the time), Legg-Perthes' disease (recognized or unrecognized at the time), multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and/or the presence of an intraacetabular labrum, as well as, in certain instances, acetabular dysplasia. When these abnormalities are taken in conjunction with the detection of other metabolic abnormalities that can lead to osteoarthritis of the hip and which may not be recognized readily, such as hemochromatosis, ochronosis, calcium pyrophosphate disease, and monarticular rheumatoid arthritis, it seems clear that either osteoarthritis of the hip does not exist at all as a primary disease entity or, if it does, is extraordinarily rare.\r"

One technical problem occurred when large osteophytes blocked access to the facet joints. Otherwise, there were no complications and minimal morbidity. Most patients (15 of 20; 75%) had an initial response, but a much smaller number (six of 18 followed more than three months; 33%) had a lasting response. Repeat injections, when done, always led to temporary improvement but rarely to lasting relief (one of five; 20%). Three factors characterized the patients: a negative screening examination for other causes of back pain or sciatica; back pain with tenderness localized over one or more facet joints; and radiologic changes of degenerative joint disease within the facet joints. Facet joint disease may be a significant cause of low back pain. The above three criteria are useful in clinical identification of patients with this problem. Facet joint injections play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain.\r"

These results illustrated that even in well-circumscribed cases with documented disc protrusion into the spinal canal, the disc space narrowing following injection may aggravate the symptoms of nerve root entrapment, especially if a low-grade lateral recess stenosis is associated with the disc protrusion. The persistence or aggravation of symptoms probably is related to these anatomic considerations. The low level of enzyme activity in the injected area may or may not be correlated with the clinical response to treatment.\r"

Eleven fractures were noted in Group II. One delayed union (9%), one superficial wound infection that healed uneventfully, and one deep vein thrombosis were noted. The average time to union was 12 weeks. All six Group III tibias had delayed and nonunions, regardless of treatment. Nonoperative fractures healed at a prolonged rate, while open reduction and internal fixation enhanced the rate and time to union. Fractures treated with early open reduction and internal fixation, excluding Group III patients, had the least orthopedic and medical complications. Open reduction and internal fixation is a justifiable alternative to nonoperative treatment in the uncomplicated tibia fracture regardless of neurologic lesion for improved medical and fracture care.\r"

In the second group of 32 patients, the patella was realigned within its groove to alter tracking of the patella to the proximal femoral condyles when necessary. Fish-mouthing technique and insertion of a drain after surgery were done. After a two-year follow-up examination, there were two failures and five complications. A third group of nine patients was treated with Ferguson's modification of Maquet's operation using a 1.25-cm tibial tubercle elevation through a transverse incision; two of the nine had complications, subsequently treated successfully by converting Ferguson's operation into the Maquet operation, as modified for Group II. The modified Maquet procedure can be an effective and reliable treatment of patellofemoral arthrosis with a relatively low incidence of complications.\r"

Differentiation may be due, in part, to increased cell density in a confined space. Growth of the mineralized tissue was observed in the living cultures with a fluorescence microscope. Electron probe microanalysis confirmed that the mineral formed was hydroxyapatite. Initiating sites of mineralization included membranous vesicular bodies, lipid, and products of cellular degeneration. Once initiated, mineralization appeared to spread rapidly into adjacent collagenous and other structures, suggesting the appearance of a mixture of skeletal-type and dystrophic mineralization.\r"

  ".W": "Published normal histomorphometric data were used to derive distributions of thicknesses of trabecular plates and completed bone remodelling units (the basic multicellular unit carrying out bone remodelling, the BMU, when completed is termed a structural unit BSU). A stochastic model was set up to investigate the predictions of current BMU theory. Each of 100 trabecular \"thicknesses\" was drawn from the appropriate normal distribution using a pseudorandom number generator. Each day, each of its two surfaces when quiescent was assumed to have a 1:900 chance of initiating a remodelling cycle. Resorption (active, 12 days; reversal phase, 27 days) was followed by formation (94 +/- 35 days) and resulted in BMU balance when resorption depth was 36.8 +/- 9.2 micron. Fenestration (thickness less than 0) was assumed to lead to permanent loss of the trabecula. The original model unrealistically increased its mean trabecular thickness as thin trabeculae were lost. This was corrected by assuming that thin trabeculae had greater osteoblastic stimulation and a consequent tendency to thicken, perhaps due to higher mechanical loading. Over 20 years, 14% of trabeculae were lost when the BMU balance was exact and the distribution of trabecular thicknesses was unchanged. About one-half of fenestrations were due to deeper-than-average resorption cavities developing in thin trabeculae, and the remainder to coincident remodelling on both surfaces. A 10% fall in osteoblast lifespan resulted in an additional 36.7% loss of trabecular bone volume and mean trabecular thickness fell to 83.1 micron, compatible with Courpron's data. Simulating more rapid mechanisms of bone loss, approximately 50% of trabeculae could be lost after ten years by the arrest of bone formation; the doubling of resorption depth with unchanged bone formation; and a doubling in the rate of initiation of new BMUs with unchanged bone formation rate, all three followed by complete recovery of BMU balance after only two years. In each case, mean trabecular thickness fell only transiently but trabeculae continued to be lost after recovery. Prolonged osteoblast life span was the most likely explanation for the increased mean trabecular thicknesses and trabecular bone volumes seen in patients with osteoporosis, when treated with sodium fluoride plus calcium supplements or daily injections of parathyroid peptide hPTH 1-34.\r"

Curettage of the radial lesion and packing it initially with autogenous iliac bone graft and subsequently with methylmethacrylate bone cement were followed by local recurrences. The radial lesion eventually was eradicated by a segmental resection of the distal radius. The resulting bony defect was bridged with a bicortical autogenous iliac graft and stabilized with a bone plate to produce a painless solid wrist fusion.

  ".W": "Osteoarthrosis is a physiologic imbalance, a \"joint failure\" similar to \"heart failure,\" in which mechanical factors play a role. The initiation and progression of cartilage damage are distinct phenomena. One of the mechanisms of initiation may be a steep stiffness gradient in the underlying subchondral bone. Progression of cartilage lesions probably requires stiffened subchondral bone. In such situations, transverse stresses at the base of the articular cartilage could cause deep horizontal splits in that tissue. The most likely cause of subchondral stiffening in an otherwise congruent joint is repeated failure of the musculoskeletal peak dynamic force attenuation mechanisms. The health and integrity of the overlying articular cartilage depends on the mechanical properties of its bony bed. In certain models of osteoarthrosis, alterations of the bony bed occur before the cartilage changes and suggest that this can occur in clinical conditions. Stiffening of the subchondral bone also can effect joint conformation, which involves deformation of articular cartilage and bone to create maximum contact areas under load.\r"

Further, the findings of polyarthropathy in the majority of these cases have indicated the propensity for a systemic disorder. Wide variations were noted in both synovial and cartilage immune changes, quite different to those found in rheumatoid arthritis, along with the frequent asymptomatology of the many joints involved. These features, with and without other causative factors, suggest that immune reactions of local and/or systemic origin occur at times in a population at risk for joint degradation.\r"

There was no effect of either agent on the incidence of osteophytes in this model.

  ".W": "It is clear that some synovial inflammation occurs in joints affected by osteoarthritis (OA) and it is well recognized that many patients with OA experience a decrease in pain and joint stiffness following administration of salicylates or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, neither the extent to which synovitis contributes to the cartilage breakdown in OA nor the effects of chronic administration of NSAIDs on the natural history of OA in humans is known. Recent studies indicate that several NSAIDs, including salicylates, suppress proteoglycan synthesis in articular cartilage in vitro. The effect on OA cartilage is more marked than that on normal cartilage. Other studies show that salicylate feeding may suppress proteoglycan metabolism in degenerating cartilage in vivo, aggravating the decrease in proteoglycan content caused by the disease itself. However, no effect of salicylates on normal articular cartilage has been observed in vivo. In damaged cartilage the magnitude of NSAID-induced suppression of proteoglycan metabolism appears to be related inversely to the proteoglycan content of the tissue. In addition, the NSAIDs used in treatment of arthritis today may differ with respect to their in vivo effects on articular cartilage metabolism due, in part, to differences between the molar concentrations of these drugs in synovial fluid.\r"

All underwent extensive neurodevelopmental and educational testing. Additional information was obtained from school and parent questionnaires and interviews. Children were not placed on medication unless they demonstrated characteristic impulsive, inattentive, and/or overactive behavior in two of three environments (home, school, clinic). Fifty-two children (80%) were not placed on medication. Follow-up was completed in 80 percent, and 93 percent of these children were doing well with nonpharmacologic interventions. Initial comparison of children not placed and placed on medication revealed that age, race, SES, amount of resource help and retention could not distinguish groups. Children placed on medication had difficulties earlier in school (chi 2 = 4.88, p less than 0.05), weren't as delayed academically (chi 2 = 6.30, p less than 0.05) and had less neurodevelopmental disorders (chi 2 = 9.01, p less than 0.01). If a careful psychosocial history does not reveal impulsive, inattentive, and/or hyperactive behavior outside of school, a child should be evaluated to rule out neurodevelopmental and educational problems.\r"

Eight hypertensive patients and seven normotensive volunteer subjects were studied. Inulin and para-aminohippuric (PAH) clearances, natriuresis, and fractional excretion of sodium increased significantly after intravenous dosing with dopamine (2 micrograms/min/kg) in both groups. These increases were significantly higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects: 31.8% +/- 3.7% vs. 16.2% +/- 1.2% for inulin clearance (P less than 0.01), 83.3% +/- 10.5% vs. 41.1% +/- 3.4% for PAH clearance (P less than 0.01), and 331% +/- 38% vs. 216% +/- 26% for natriuresis (P less than 0.01). These findings suggest hyperresponsiveness to dopamine during hypertension. This enhanced response to exogenous dopamine can be considered as a further argument favoring the existence of a deficit in dopaminergic activity during hypertension. Dopamine also induced a significant reduction in blood pressure and increased heart rate in hypertensive subjects but no significant change in blood pressure and heart rate occurred in normotensive subjects.\r"

Blood samples were drawn at specified times during a 24-hour period after dosing. Plasma concentrations of amrinone were determined by a specific HPLC method. The plasma concentration data were fitted to a biexponential model by nonlinear regression. The mean apparent first-order elimination t1/2 for amrinone in the slow acetylators was 4.4 hours, whereas it was 2.0 hours in the fast acetylators (P less than 0.05). There was little difference in the volume of distribution at steady state. Clearance was lower in the slow acetylators, 16.6 L/hr, than in the fast acetylators, 37.2 L/hr (P less than 0.05). The AUC was higher for the slow acetylators, 4.96 micrograms X hr X ml-1, than for the fast acetylators, 2.20 micrograms X hr X ml-1 (P less than 0.01). Concentrations of amrinone and its N-acetyl metabolite in the urine from each volunteer were determined. The ratio of N-acetylamrinone to amrinone was calculated and, as expected, the fast acetylators had a higher ratio than did the slow acetylators (P less than 0.01).\r"

Objective (tracking, divided attention, Maddox wing, etc.) and subjective (visual analogue scales and questionnaires) tests were done before and twice after single oral doses. Diazepam (0.15 and 0.30 mg/kg) impaired performance dose relatedly and rendered the subjects drowsy, calm, mentally slow, and clumsy. Buspirone (15 mg) proved inactive in objective tests but matched diazepam (0.30 mg/kg) subjectively. In combinations, buspirone added to the effects of diazepam in Maddox wing and letter cancellation but tended to counteract diazepam effects on divided attention and learning acquisition. Subjectively buspirone prolonged diazepam-induced sedation. Increased calmness caused by diazepam was not affected by concomitant buspirone. It is suggested that combining small doses of buspirone to diazepam does not cause any additional decrement in psychomotor performance. Possible advantages of the diazepam-buspirone combination in therapeutic use are discussed.\r"

Fifty-six healthy male subjects were given either placebo or three equal daily doses of SQ 28,668 ranging from 25 to 1200 mg. Plasma drug concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner. The shape of the plasma drug concentration-time curve was consistent with enterohepatic recirculation. The effects of SQ 28,668 on ex vivo platelet aggregation suggested that SQ 28,668 is a specific competitive antagonist of thromboxane A2 with a platelet receptor dissociation constant (estimated by Schild analysis) of about 19 nmol/L. Approximately 94% occupation of thromboxane receptors by SQ 28,668 was required to produce a small but measurable increase of the template bleeding time. Dose-ranging studies of antithrombotic drugs are difficult and expensive. For this reason, a method was developed that allows estimation of the dose of a thromboxane receptor antagonist that would be expected to be therapeutically equivalent to a given dose of aspirin.\r"

To determine whether pinacidil's metabolism or effects were influenced by either liver disease or the subject's debrisoquin phenotype, eight patients with chronic stable cirrhosis and 13 healthy subjects were studied. Seven of the healthy volunteers were extensive metabolizers of debrisoquin, whereas six were of the poor metabolizer phenotype. Neither the clearance of pinacidil nor the production of the N-oxide was altered by the subjects' debrisoquin phenotype. Cirrhosis produced a 50% reduction in pinacidil's clearance (20.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 42.1 +/- 5.1 L/hr; P less than 0.0005) and a prolongation in the elimination t1/2 from 3.9 +/- 0.3 to 6.1 +/- 0.6 hours (P less than 0.01). Less pinacidil was metabolized to the N-oxide metabolite in the patients with cirrhosis than in the normal individuals. Thus pinacidil's metabolism and clearance are reduced in patients with cirrhosis but are independent of debrisoquin phenotype.\r"

During a 12-month period, nitrendipine was used as monotherapy in 30 patients and in combination with propranolol or a diuretic in an additional 28 patients. Nitrendipine monotherapy lowered supine blood pressure from 148/97 to 136/83 mm Hg, but LV mass did not change significantly. Supine blood pressure decreased from 155/103 to 134/86 mm Hg in patients receiving combination therapy but, again, changes in LV mass were not significant.

Knowledge of the side-effect spectrum of the various classes of antipsychotic drugs is necessary for the clinician to arrive at a rational choice of medication. In general, the preferred drug will be a high-potency neuroleptic. The following basic principles of clinical psychopharmacology should be followed: Consider risk and benefits; clinical experience is prerequisite; establish the diagnosis; select the appropriate class of psychotropic drug for the primary diagnosis; within drug class, the drugs are usually equally effective for patients with the diagnosis; give a dose that is high enough to be effective; choose target symptoms that can be monitored to indicate when to stop or increase the drug; avoid use of multiple drugs when possible; drugs are only one element in a comprehensive treatment strategy. Other modalities need equally careful consideration, e.g., psychotherapy, group therapy, family treatment, and vocational rehabilitation; and consultation with other subspecialists should be sought readily when indicated.\r"

  ".W": "Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' is an Australian hybrid plant which may cause allergic contact dermatitis. Over the past 8 years, it has been planted extensively in Australia and is now being exported to the United States and other Western countries. Recently, an explosion in incidence of contact dermatitis due to this plant has been seen. 24 patients who were suspected of being sensitive to it were patch tested to fresh plant and extracts with confirmation of sensitivity. A cross sensitivity to Toxicodendron was demonstrated clinically and on patch testing. The allergen in Toxicodendron, 3 pentadecylcatechol, is closely linked in chemical structure to 5-pentadecylresorcinol, present in Grevillea banksii and tridecylresorcinol in Grevillea robusta. Patch testing in patients sensitive to Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' with tridecylresorcinol produced positive reactions, thus implicating the sensitizing role of long chain alkyl resorcinols in Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' allergy. There is a likelihood that this sensitizing potential extends to other plants of the Grevillea genus, e.g., Grevillea robusta. With the spread of Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' to other markets, this problem will become increasingly common.\r"

The dermal inflammatory cell response was mainly mononuclear (lymphocytic) in nature. With the SLS reactions as control, various organic solvents were studied and ranked against the SLS reactions and internally. Trichlorethylene was the most irritant solvent, ranking as high as 2% SLS. Other chlorinated hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons tested caused irritant reactions. The alcohols and acetone gave no reaction. White spirit was as irritant as trichlorethylene. Thinners were less irritant, around the level of the 1% SLS control reaction. The 4-day experimental design is a convenient and suitable animal model for screening irritant potential, and provides information relevant to the pathogenesis of irritant contact reactions.\r"

All had allergic contact dermatitis from chromate in cement. No worker had isolated cobalt sensitivity and cement dermatitis. It appeared that sensitization to cobalt in cement occurs only secondarily to an existing cement dermatitis. 1.8% (5/272) workers had nickel sensitivity: 2 with allergic contact dermatitis to nickel in their watches, 2 were asymptomatic and 1 had allergic contact dermatitis to chromate and cobalt in cement. The low prevalence of cobalt and nickel sensitivity from cement was probably related to the low concentration of soluble cobalt and nickel salts in the cement. However, these insoluble salts can form soluble complexes with body fluids on eczematous skin and sensitize the skin.\r"

A highly sensitive electrochemical method was used to quantify the amount of nickel permeating the skin. The investigations show that nickel ions are capable of permeating the skin barrier when applied under occlusion. The process is slow, having a lag time of approximately 50 h. The permeation rate, and thus the physical amount being bioavailable, is considerably increased when aqueous nickel chloride is used in comparison with aqueous nickel sulphate. With respect to nickel permeation of the skin, we conclude that the choice of salt is an important consideration in patch testing.\r"

Anesthetized dogs were rapidly bled to a mean arterial pressure of 40 mm Hg and then retransfused with the shed blood in a stepwise fashion. PcjO2 fell to 2% of control values after hemorrhage and did not return to prehemorrhage values until more than 90% of the shed blood had been reinfused. PcjO2 was among the last set of cardiorespiratory variables to return to control values during resuscitation and was the last noninvasive variable to normalize. The ratio of PcjO2 to arterial oxygen tension decreased from a prehemorrhage value of 0.76 +/- 0.05 (SEM) to 0.02 +/- 0.003 after hemorrhage, and did not increase to values greater than 0.50 until resuscitation was more than 90% complete.

  ".W": "The effects of dobutamine on hemodynamic and oxygen transport were evaluated in 43 studies on 34 critically ill general (noncardiac) surgical patients. Dobutamine, beginning at a low dose (2.5 micrograms/kg X min) significantly increased cardiac index (CI), oxygen delivery (DO2), and oxygen consumption (VO2), while decreasing mean arterial pressure, pulmonary artery and wedge pressures, and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances; blood gases, pH, and pulmonary shunt were not significantly changed. These effects were seen in postoperative and septic patients, as well as in patients with normal, low, and high control CI. These responses were poor in terminally ill and hypovolemic patients; however, when the latter were given additional fluids, their responses were markedly improved. The hemodynamic effects of dobutamine are well known, but the DO2 and VO2 effects, which suggest improved tissue perfusion, have not been appreciated.\r"

Both the minimum and mean values for the distance between the inner electrodes, and a variety of values for the resistivity of blood (rho) were substituted in the Kubicek's empiric formula for calculating cardiac output by transthoracic electrical impedance. Using the mean distance between the inner electrodes and a rho-value of 150 ohm X cm gave the best agreement between the methods (mean difference 0.17 +/- 2.4 L/min). Ventilation alone or with positive end-expiratory pressure did not significantly affect the bias of the estimate, but both affected its precision when compared with measurements in spontaneously breathing patients (SD of mean difference 2.4 and 3.2 L/min, respectively, vs. 1.5 L/min). The pulmonary artery wedge pressure was significantly higher in patients with an abnormal diastolic impedance waveform (zero-wave), but there was no relationship between wedge pressure and base impedance per unit length between the measuring electrodes.\r"

  ".W": "To achieve adequate arterial BP, adequate capillary filling time, and adequate peripheral pulses, hypotensive newborn infants often require higher doses of dopamine that reportedly reduce urine output in adults. Whether these larger doses of dopamine also reduce urine output in newborns is not known. Therefore, we determined the effects of administering high-dose dopamine (more than 20 micrograms/kg X min) on the urine output of 15 newborn infants. Five infants were studied prospectively and ten retrospectively. In the prospective study, urine output was determined as the dose of dopamine was increased; in the retrospective study, urine output was determined as the infants were being weaned from high doses of dopamine. Both data sets demonstrate that administering high-dosage dopamine does not reduce the urine output of sick newborn infants. Therefore, we conclude that doses of dopamine previously reported to decrease urine output in adults do not do so in sick newborn infants. Consequently, when necessary, high doses of dopamine may be used in sick newborn infants to achieve cardiovascular stability without reducing urine output.\r"

Thirty-two neonates with respiratory distress were alternately enrolled in an experimental group (results of PtcO2 and PtcCO2 available for clinical management) and a control group (results of only PtcO2 available). Although differences were not significant, infants in the experimental group had more changes in the intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) settings during transport, and more such infants arrived at the receiving hospital with acceptable pH and PCO2 values. On arrival at the receiving hospital, two patients in the control group had acidosis and hypercarbia and were placed on IMV immediately on arrival. No such patients were encountered in the experimental group. For patients needing IMV during transport, the percentage of study time spent with PtcCO2 measurements in the normal range (35 to 45 torr) was greater for the experimental group (p less than .02). Continuous PtcCO2 monitoring during transport offers the opportunity to further decrease the risks of transporting a critically ill neonate.\r"

In the first four patients, CAVH was used in conjunction with either peritoneal or hemodialysis. In the fifth patient, CAVH was the sole renal replacement therapy employed; in this critically ill anuric infant, we were best able to evaluate the ability of CAVH to continuously control fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance, and allow the administration of adequate parenteral nutrition. The difficulties encountered were related to anticoagulation, establishment of adequate vascular access, and selection of an appropriate hemofilter for the performance of the technique. Despite the application of suction-assistance, we were unable to effectively employ a prototype pediatric hemofilter to attain a level of plasma ultrafiltration consistent with the objectives of therapy. However, we were able to effectively and safely employ an adult hemofilter for these purposes; modifications were made in the adult hemofilter system before its application in the smallest pediatric patients. Our experience suggests that, even in critically ill infants, CAVH can be successfully applied as an effective renal replacement therapy. However, further experience is required before its potential impact on patient survival can be assessed.\r"

Laryngospasm associated with intubation and general anesthesia is a common cause of pulmonary edema in children. However, only seven cases of pulmonary edema presumably due to laryngospasm have been reported in adolescents and adults. Five of the seven had other risk factors for upper airway obstruction, and in four, the diagnosis of \"laryngospasm\" could be explained by other factors. Patients with underlying risk factors for upper airway obstruction, such as a forme fruste of sleep apnea or nasopharyngeal abnormalities, appear to be at increased risk for the development of pulmonary edema in the setting of intubation and anesthesia. This form of pulmonary edema usually resolves rapidly without the need for aggressive therapy or invasive monitoring.\r"

Techniques of insertion were vigorously supervised. Central and peripheral catheters were cared for by identical protocols. Overt phlebitis or inflammation around the site was 14 times as common with peripheral catheters (353/1,024) than with centrally inserted central catheters (18/713), even though peripheral catheters were removed on the average at 2.9 days and centrally inserted central catheters at 6.2 days. Pneumothorax occurred in seven out of 713 patients with centrally inserted central catheterization, one with hemothorax and two with pneumothoraces requiring thoracostomy tubes. Five were treated successfully with simple catheter aspiration. Three patients out of 1,496 with peripheral or peripherally inserted central catheters required phlebectomy for suppurative thrombophlebitis. We concluded that overall morbidity in critically ill patients is lower from centrally inserted central catheters than peripheral intravenous catheters, with peripherally inserted central catheters in an intermediate position. Supervision of techniques of insertion has to be kept at a high level to keep complications of central catheterization at an acceptable level. Peripheral catheter sites would be better maintained with more frequent replacement of the catheter.\r"

Medroxyprogesterone did not alter significantly the total time of apnea or the total time for disordered breathing, expressed as percentages of total sleep time. Arterial oxygen desaturation during apnea and disordered breathing did not change with treatment.

Assessment tests were performed at the outset, end of the first and second weeks, and finally end of the third week. The parameters measured were: pulmonary function, exercise testing on a bicycle ergometer, and the distance covered in a 12 minute walk. Subjective sensations of dyspnea at rest and during guarded exercise, as well as subjective feelings of calmness or anxiety were also recorded. There was no difference in mechanical lung function, but the PO2 tended to decrease and PCO2 to increase after alprazolam administration. The maximum exercise level attained and the distance covered in the 12 minute walk was unchanged. The subjective perception of dyspnea was the same before and after alprazolam, at rest and during exercise.

  ".W": "Mechanical ventilation was able to induce a decrease in cardiac output and regional blood flow, especially hepatic flow. Thus, hepatic elimination of drugs with a high hepatic-extraction ratio, which was linked to alteration in hepatic blood flow, could be reduced during mechanical ventilation. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of mechanical ventilation on pharmacokinetic parameters of lidocaine, which is a well-known nonrestrictive elimination drug at the hepatic level. Five patients (mean age, 58 years) with normal hepatic function and quite similar gasometric parameters before and after weaning from mechanical ventilation were studied. With a washout period of 48 hours between mechanical ventilation and spontaneous ventilation, each patient was submitted to the following protocol: lidocaine in a bolus (1.5 mg/kg intravenously), followed by infusion (1.0 to 1.7 mg/min for 120 minutes). The results were that the peak plasma concentration after the bolus during mechanical ventilation was 3.22 +/- 0.37 mg/L (mean +/- SE) vs 2.40 +/- 0.35 mg/L during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.02). Steady-state plasma concentration during mechanical ventilation was 2.10 +/- 0.20 mg/L vs 1.64 +/- 0.16 mg/L during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.01). Total clearance was 604.2 +/- 87.0 ml/min during mechanical ventilation vs 775.0 +/- 112.1 ml/min during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.01). Elimination half-life was 245.2 +/- 50.6 minutes during mechanical ventilation vs 160.0 +/- 40.6 minutes during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.05). Distribution volume was 188.6 +/- 50.2 L during mechanical ventilation and 183.0 +/- 50.8 L during spontaneous ventilation (not significant). These preliminary data clearly demonstrated a decrease in lidocaine elimination in patients submitted to mechanical ventilation, but the magnitude of dosage adjustment of such a highly hepatic-extracted drug in patients submitted to mechanical ventilation remains to be investigated.\r"

  ".W": "Upper airway obstruction is usually diagnosed by visual examination of maximum expiratory and inspiratory flow-volume curves and by calculating a ratio of expiratory to inspiratory flow at 50 percent of vital capacity (mid-vital capacity flow ratio); however, reference values of this ratio have not been well established, and considerable variability exists. The purpose of this study was to examine the range of mid-vital capacity flow ratios in a group of healthy subjects and to determine if some of the variability is accounted for by different maximum inspiratory pressures. We measured maximum expiratory and inspiratory flows at 50 percent of vital capacity from the flow-volume curves, and maximum inspiratory pressures in a group of 60 healthy nonsmokers (30 men and 30 women) whose ages ranged from 21 to 40 years. We found that mid-vital capacity flow ratio (mean +/- SD) was 0.72 +/- 0.19 in men and 0.77 +/- 0.18 in women. The coefficient of variation of the mid-vital capacity flow ratio was 28 percent for men and 23 percent for women. The 95 percent confidence limits for the mid-vital capacity flow ratio were 0.65 to 0.79 for men and 0.70 to 0.84 for women. Maximum inspiratory pressures (mean +/- SD) were 129 +/- 30 cm H2O in men and 91 +/- 16 cm H2O in women, not significantly different from previous studies. Normalizing maximum inspiratory flow for maximum inspiratory pressure did not reduce the coefficient of variation, which became 29 percent in men and 30 percent in women. We conclude that the range of mid-vital capacity flow ratios is wide, and it cannot be reduced by standardizing it for maximum inspiratory pressures.\r"

We have detected a human serum ACE-inhibitor which affects the ACE level obtained by activity measurements. The effect of the inhibitor can be eliminated by a mere eight-fold dilution of the serum sample with physiologic saline. We recommend that serum ACE be performed with 1:8 dilutions of serum to eliminate the effect of the ACE inhibitor. The inhibitor has a MW above 50,000 daltons, and reversibility of inhibition by dilution appears to be ion dependent. Dialysis of an inhibitor-containing serum sample against saline causes the inhibition to become irreversible, allowing the distinction between alinearity of the assay vs an inhibitor effect when a serum has ACE activity greater than 50 units/ml. The source of the serum ACE-inhibitor remains to be determined.\r"

Within-subject changes in clearance have been generally reported in patients with acute exacerbations of disease states such as cor pulmonale or heart failure. Apparent random changes in theophylline clearance within the same patient have recently been reported. This report describes a case of suspected changes in the clearance of theophylline in a morbidly obese patient (250 kg) over a two-month period of time. Frequent dosage adjustments were required to maintain theophylline concentrations within the range of 8.2 to 27.3 micrograms/ml. Possible explanations for these changes included hypoxia and medically induced starvation. Daily theophylline doses ranged from 600 to 1600 mg/d. It is concluded that in some individuals, within-subject changes in theophylline clearance can be substantial, thus requiring frequent monitoring of theophylline concentration.\r"

Serum, subcutaneous adipose tissue, wound drainage, and urine were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography for cefamandole and pharmacokinetic parameters from the intraoperative period were compared to those obtained postoperatively. Total body clearance was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) postoperatively (297 ml/min) than intraoperatively (254 ml/min). Volume changes were unpredictable but the elimination rate constant tended to increase postoperatively. Renal clearance and percentage of urinary recovery were significantly increased (p less than 0.01) postoperatively. The patients had a mean (+/- SD) volume of the central compartment of 10.3 (+/- 2.3) L, volume at steady state of 18.3 (+/- 3.9) L, and elimination rate constant of 1.67 (+/- 0.63) h-1. Tissue concentrations of cefamandole were highest during the first hour after drug administration and were less than 1 microgram/g after 3.5 hours. Mean wound drainage concentrations ranged between 10 and 12 micrograms/ml during a dosing interval and dropped to 7 micrograms/ml 12 hours after the last dose. Intraoperative dosing of cefamandole is required to maintain subcutaneous adipose tissue concentrations greater than 1 microgram/g during procedures longer than three hours in morbidly obese patients. A postoperative dose of cefamandole 2 g iv q6h will provide sustained and therapeutic concentrations in the wound drainage of morbidly obese patients.\r"

None of the treatments prevented ovulation. However, the combination of drugs inhibited subsequent function of the corpus luteum (CL) as assessed by serum measurements of progesterone. Administration of antihistamines did not alter pituitary secretion of LH. Injection of small quantities of diphenhydramine and cimetidine into the antrum of the preovulatory follicle also caused aberrant luteal activity, but no blockade of ovulation. Intrafollicular injection of histamine reversed the inhibitory influence of antihistamines on the CL. Antihistamines suppressed preovulatory thecal edema and antral influx of plasma transudate containing LH. Thus, the effects of antihistamines appear to have been exerted at the follicular level. Function of matured CL was not compromised by peripheral administration of antihistamines. Actions of histamine within the preovulatory ovine follicle do not appear to be a prerequisite for ovulation, but apparently do have an impact on ensuing luteal function. We propose that a hyperemic reaction to histamine in preovulatory follicles enhances vascular filtration of LH. As a consequence, maximal permeation of the avascular granulosal layer of the follicle by LH leads to a normal luteinization response.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of decidualization on uterine immunoglobulins (Igs), we measured the levels of IgG, IgA, and secretory component (SC) after induction of artificial decidual cell reactions (DCR) in hormonally primed ovariectomized rats. When progesterone-treated (2.5 mg/day, 3 days) rats received an intraluminal instillation of oil or a needle scratch stimulation in one uterine horn, the stimulated horn had an increase in wet weight and cytoplasmic protein relative to the contralateral horn. Under these conditions, IgG levels increased 10-fold in the lumen of the stimulated horn. This response was selective for IgG, because induction of DCR had no effect on accumulation of IgA or SC in the stimulated horn. The progesterone-induced accumulation of IgG after DCR was further enhanced by estradiol. The addition of a small amount of estradiol (0.2 microgram) on day 3 of a 4-day progesterone pretreatment resulted in further increases in both the wet weight of the stimulated horn and the concentration of IgG in the lumen. The amount of IgG in the lumen of the stimulated horn was 5-fold greater than that in the stimulated horn after progesterone alone. Levels of IgA and SC, however, remained unchanged with this treatment. These results indicate that movement of IgG into the uterine lumen occurs as a part of the DCR and that both an appropriate endocrine balance and physical stimulation are essential for maximal IgG accumulation. Further, they suggest that IgG may play a central role in early pregnancy, which results in the successful implantation of the blastocysts.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the availability of PRL modulates the chloride concentration of human sweat. Full thickness human skin grafted into the back of immunoincompetent, nude, congenitally athymic mice heals in about 6 to 10 weeks and survives the life of the mice. Mice have no sweat glands in the back so this system provides a useful model for study of the physiology and pathology of human sweat glands. The graft can be induced to sweat and the sweat collected for analytical studies. Presumably normal skin obtained from 7 individuals undergoing reconstructive surgery was grafted successfully into 11 mice. On 49 occasions sweat was induced by pilocarpine iontophoresis and collected for 45 min. The chloride concentration was 12.9 +/- 6.7 meq/liter, values typical of normal human sweat. Nine mice bearing grafts were injected with rabbit anti-human PRL (hPRL). The chloride concentration of sweat obtained a day later was significantly elevated. The concentration generally increased after a second and sometimes a third injection of anti-PRL. The average maximum sweat chloride obtained was 61.9 +/- 8.25 meq/liter. Serum of rabbits that had not been exposed to hPRL was prepared and diluted in the same way as the anti-hPRL. The chloride concentration of sweat of 3 mice that received the preparation for several days remained unchanged at the low normal level. We conclude that depletion of PRL increases the concentration of chloride in human sweat.\r"

Uterine tissues were assayed biochemically for ER content, fixed for histology and frozen for immunocytochemistry of ER with monoclonal antiestrophilins. On day 0, ER levels in endometrium were low [1330 +/- 201 (n = 9) fmol/mg DNA]. An increase in total receptor was evident by 3-4 days of P withdrawal 2762 +/- 190 (n = 6) fmol/mg DNA; P less than 0.001]. Total receptor concentrations increased linearly with time from 0.5-7 days of P withdrawal (r = 0.88). On day 0, staining for nuclear ER in the glandular epithelium and stroma of zones I, II, and III of the endometrium was negative. Beginning at 12-24 h and continuing through 4 days of P withdrawal, nuclear staining became detectable and increased in intensity only in endometrial stromal fibroblasts and myometrial smooth muscle cells. The glandular epithelium of the endometrium did not develop nuclear staining until 5-7 days of P withdrawal, coincident with a 10-fold increase in the mitotic index of the epithelium of the upper zones. Thus, the increase in endometrial ER levels that occurred during the first 5 days of an induced luteal-follicular transition took place almost exclusively in stromal fibroblasts.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo stimulation of vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein (9 K CaBP) synthesis by 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25(OH)2D3] in the rat duodenum has been analyzed using a specific [32P]complementary DNA probe for rat 9 K CaBP and inhibitors of RNA transcription (actinomycin D, alpha-amanitin) or protein synthesis (cycloheximide). The relative amounts of 9 K CaBP messenger RNA (mRNA) were assayed by dot-blot hybridization and the relative amounts of 9 K CaBP by RIA. Both inhibitors were injected at doses which significantly inhibited by 80-95% [35S]methionine or [3H]uridine incorporation into protein and RNA, respectively. In vitamin D-deficient rats, a single 1,25(OH)2D3 injection (650 pmol/100 g BW) resulted in a rapid production of 9 K CaBP mRNA which was significantly detectable as early as 3 h, and was followed by an increase of 9 K CaBP levels. Injection of actinomycin D (25 micrograms/100 g BW) 1 h before 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment and repeated every 4 h did not prevent the hormone-induced elevation of duodenal CaBP mRNA, even when the actinomycin dose was doubled and given 2 h before hormonal treatment. alpha-Amanitin (2 micrograms/100 g BW) also failed to block the hormonal stimulation. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (25 micrograms/100 g BW) did not cause any change in the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced CaBP mRNA but blocked the CaBP increase after hormone injection. Thus, transcription inhibitors did not prevent the in vivo hormone-induced elevation of 9 K CaBP mRNA, which suggests that 1,25(OH)2D3 increases 9 K CaBP synthesis by increasing 9 K CaBP gene expression at one or more posttranscriptional steps. More precise data will be obtained by measuring the rate of 9 K CaBP gene transcription on isolated nuclei from rat duodenum.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta E2) on anterior pituitary dopaminergic receptor (D2) content was studied in vitro in relation to PRL secretion. Anterior pituitaries from ovariectomized rats were incubated for short periods in medium 199, with or without the steroid. Dopamine (DA) receptors in partially purified pituitary membranes were quantified by equilibrium binding using [3H]spiperone; the PRL released into the incubation medium was analyzed by RIA. Addition of 10(-10) to 10(-6) M 17 beta E2 to the incubation medium of anterior pituitaries rapidly and reversibly decreased the number of DA receptors (P less than 0.01 to 0.001), while increasing PRL release, in a dose-related fashion. The maximal effect on both receptor numbers and PRL secretion was obtained with 10(-8) M 17 beta E2. This effect involved no change in receptor affinity (Kd = 0.11 +/- 0.01 nM in presence or in absence of 17 beta E2). This estrogen-induced decrease in DA-binding capacity was apparently not the result of the occupation of spiperone binding sites by the steroid, since after a 30-min incubation with 10(-8) M [3H]17 beta E2, no radioactivity was detectable on the partially purified membranes. Moreover, the presence of 17 beta E2 at the same time as the labeled D2 ligand did not modify the kinetics of association or dissociation of spiperone with pituitary membranes. This decrease in anterior pituitary DA receptor content and the increase in PRL release were already significant after a 7-min incubation in the presence of 10(-8) M 17 beta E2. Finally, these effects of 17 beta E2 were not mimicked by its 17 alpha-stereoisomer, nor by progesterone, or testosterone. These results suggest that the stimulatory effect of 17 beta E2 on PRL secretion may be due, at least in part, to the desensitization of anterior pituitary cells to DA. The steroid may produce this desensitization directly by decreasing the number of D2. The short latency of this effect likely discards the possibility of a genomic action of 17 beta E2.\r"

Treatment with (Bu)2cAMP and retinol for 12-24 h and with basal medium for an additional 8 days stimulated mitotic activity in type A spermatogonia and induced differentiation of germ cells. However, (Bu)2cAMP alone did not induce differentiation of type A spermatogonia. Moreover, when cryptorchid testes were treated with (Bu)2cAMP for longer than 3 days in the presence or absence of retinol, differentiation of type A spermatogonia did not take place; disintegration of the seminiferous tubules occurred instead. When the cryptorchid testes were cultured for 24 h in a medium containing a fixed concentration of retinol and varying concentrations of (Bu)2cAMP from 0.001-0.4 mM, there was a dose-dependent increase in the number of differentiated and mitotic germ cells and type A spermatogonia. Likewise, at a fixed dose of (Bu)2cAMP and increasing concentrations of retinol, a dose-dependent increase in the number of differentiated and mitotic germ cells occurred. However, the number of type A spermatogonia was decreased. The addition of puromycin, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D to the medium completely blocked retinol-(Bu)2cAMP-induced differentiation of the germ cells. The present results suggest that cAMP and retinol trigger biochemical events promoting the synthesis of specific macromolecules involved in the proliferation and differentiation of type A spermatogonia.\r"

A sensitive RNA detection assay that uses in vitro transcribed RNA probes corresponding to specific exons of the VIP gene was devised to study VIP gene expression. Using this method, an approximately 2000-base long RNA containing the coding sequences for VIP was detected in rat hypothalamus. This RNA also contains the coding sequences for the VIP-related peptide PHM/I (peptide histidine methionine amide or isoleucine amide). An identical VIP-encoding RNA was previously identified in the rat cerebral cortex. A 2-fold increase was observed in hypothalamic VIP mRNA during lactation. In addition, the levels of this mRNA increased in the hypothalamus at the time of sexual maturation. Taken together, our results suggest a physiological regulation of VIP gene expression associated with its potential role as a neuroendocrine hormone.\r"

  ".W": "Maternal and fetal rabbit thyroid glands were compared as to their ability to respond to excess iodide in vitro with a reduction in subsequent iodide transport activity. Preincubation of maternal thyroid tissue slices for 2 h with excess iodide (30 microM) resulted in a 31% reduction in the subsequently measured thyroid-medium radioiodide concentration ratio. In contrast, similar iodide pretreatment had no significant effect on fetal iodide transport. In all other respects, fetal iodide transport, although it was 10 times higher, did not differ significantly from maternal transport activity. Combined radiolabeled maternal (125I) and fetal (131I) rabbit thyroid tissue was eluted on Sephadex G-25 columns. Fractions were analyzed for both 125I and 131I activity, and the maternal to fetal ratios (125I/131I) were determined for each fraction. The majority of iodoproteins eluted with the void volume, and the 125I/131I ratio was constant in these fractions. Thereafter, two peaks of elevated 125I/131I activity could be observed. Peak A eluted below lysozyme (Mr = 14,300) and above insulin (Mr = 6,000), with an apparent mol wt of 8,000 to 10,000. A second peak, peak B, eluted from the column at a site similar to that of MIT or a protein of Mr of 2,000. Ascending paper chromatography of this latter peak of 125I/131I activity and MIT was carried out in two solvent systems. In both systems, peak B comigrated with MIT. These findings suggest that the failure of fetal thyroid tissue to exhibit autoregulation may be associated with the reduced iodination of a compound with an approximate Mr of 8,000 to 10,000. The role of this substance in iodide transport remains to be identified. The reason for the apparent increase in the labeling of MIT observed in maternal vs. fetal tissue is unknown.\r"

  ".W": "The role of protein synthesis in iodide-induced suppression of subsequent iodide transport (iodide autoregulation) was studied in cat thyroid slices. Thyroid slices were pretreated for 60-120 min in the presence or absence of either excess (30 microM) sodium iodide, inhibitors of protein synthesis, or both. Tissue was then washed in the presence of 2 mM methimazole to prevent subsequent iodination reaction and remove excess iodide. Iodide transport activity was finally evaluated by measurement of the ratio of tissue to medium iodide concentrations in 90-min incubations. Addition of 0.1 mM cycloheximide during the preexposure of thyroid tissue to excess iodide had no effect on either control levels of iodide transport or iodide-induced autoregulation. However, if thyroid tissue was treated with cycloheximide alone for 1 h before preexposure to excess iodide, there was a significant reduction in the degree of iodide-induced induced autoregulation. Similar results were obtained with pretreatment of the tissue with 0.5 mM puromycin and 1 microgram/ml emetine. These findings suggest that protein synthesis is involved in the mechanism of thyroid autoregulation of iodide transport. Cycloheximide had no effect on the ability of excess iodide to reduce TSH-stimulated cAMP formation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-isoelectric focusing and Sephadex G-25 column chromatography employing dual-isotope comparison of iodoprotein labeling of control and cycloheximide-treated tissue suggest that the ability of cycloheximide to suppress iodide-induced autoregulation is associated with the reduced iodination of an 8- to 10-kilodalton soluble component of the thyroid gland.\r"

This increase in enzymatic activity was accompanied by an increase in calmodulin content of the basolateral membrane. Although neither exogenously added calmodulin (up to 10 micrograms/ml) nor calcium (from 10(-7)-10(-5) M) stimulated enzyme activity, calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine, W7, and W13 inhibited it. When calmodulin content, adenylate cyclase activity, and alkaline phosphatase activity were measured in cells sequentially eluted from the tip to the base of the villus, cells from the midregion and base had the highest calmodulin content and adenylate cyclase activity, whereas alkaline phosphatase activity (a brush border membrane enzyme) was highest in cells eluted from the tip. Adenylate cyclase activity was increased by 1,25-(OH)2D3, particularly in cells from the midvillus. Our results indicate that the response of adenylate cyclase activity to 1,25-(OH)2D3 varies along the villus and suggest that calmodulin may be involved.\r"

Animals infused with 1,25-(OH)2D3 exhibited mild hypercalcemia (11.2 vs. 10.2 mg/dl in controls), a 136% increase in the serum concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (187 vs. 79 pg/ml), and a 59% decrease in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (12 vs. 29 ng/ml).

Similar but less striking changes were seen in the lumbar vertebra. Increases in the fat-free weight and calcium content of the tibia and lumbar vertebra were consistent with the increase in trabecular bone volume after 1,25-(OH)2D3 infusion. However, tetracycline labeling and the incorporation of 45Ca in these bones were reduced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 infusion. In addition, mineralization lag time was prolonged in the lumbar vertebrae of 1,25-(OH)2D3-infused rats.

Analysis of about 1500 in vitro translation products on giant two-dimensional gels revealed rapid hormonal influences on only 7 mRNAs, 6 whose translation products have mol wt and pIs identical to those proteins whose synthesis has been found to be increased after the addition of glucocorticoids to thymus cells. The additional mRNA codes for glucocortin, whose induction in thymus as well as other target cells has been reported. mRNA inductions for proteins 1, 2, and 1N are detectable 15-30 min after the addition of dexamethasone to isolated thymus cells and continue to increase until 2 h, whereas the mRNAs for proteins 4 and 5 are not increased until after 1 h. The mRNA for protein 3 is elevated by 1 h, but attempts to quantitate the change at earlier times have failed because this protein focuses poorly. The parallel between these in vitro translation results and the increased synthesis of individual proteins seen in whole cells demonstrates that increased mRNA levels underlie the cellular changes. Other hormones, such as estradiol, testosterone, and T3, at 10(-6) M and deoxycorticosterone at 10(-8) M do not induce these messages. Partial inductions of 1 and 2, but not 1N, are seen with deoxycorticosterone at 10(-6) M, consistent with its classification as a partial glucocorticoid agonist. Cycloheximide does not block the rise in mRNA for the most rapid inductions, 1, 2, and 1N. The results indicate that dexamethasone rapidly and specifically induces 6 thymus cell mRNAs in addition to the one coding for glucocortin. The cycloheximide results suggest that at least 3 of these represent primary steroid hormone responses.\r"

  ".W": "17 beta-Estradiol (E2) affects the sensitivity of pituitary cells to several neurohormones as LHRH, TRH, or dopamine, presumably by modulating receptor coupling mechanisms. We attempted to pinpoint the membrane processes underlying this modulation and studied the effect of E2 on pituitary membrane phospholipid methylation. Anterior pituitary membranes prepared from ovariectomized (ovx) or ovx plus E2-treated rats were assayed for phospholipid methylation. Methylated phospholipids were separated by TLC. Incorporation of [3H]methyl groups into phospholipids increased with membrane concentration and incubation time with S-adenosyl-L-methyl [3H]methionine; it was not Mg2+ dependent and was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, methyltransferase inhibitor. pH was found to be critical. Formation of phosphatidyl-monoethanolamine, phosphatidyl-dimethylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine was markedly stimulated by treatment with E2. The effect increased progressively when animals were killed 15 h to 5 days after E2 implantation. The response involved a shift in the maximum velocity (Vmax) although there was no change in the available substrate for the methylating enzyme. This change in Vmax probably reflects changes in the amount of the methylating enzyme itself. Administration of 17 alpha-estradiol, an inactive stereoisomer of E2 was ineffective, pointing to a stereospecific interaction. After differential centrifugation of pituitary membranes, the highest specific methyltransferase activity was found in light mitochondrial (L) and microsomal (P) fractions and the lowest in nuclei (N) and the heavy mitochondrial (M) fractions. After sucrose density gradient centrifugation, methylated phospholipids were preferentially recovered from fractions corresponding to the endoplasmic reticulum and/or secretory granules. E2 treatment for 5 days did not modify the subcellular distribution of methyltransferase activity but stimulated it in all fractions; in contrast, it did not modify the activity of the other enzymes measured as fraction markers. Under the same experimental conditions, phospholipid methylation in membranes prepared from cortex, and anterior and mediobasal hypothalamic structures was not affected by the steroid, with the exception of a slight increment of [3H]methyl incorporation into mediobasal hypothalamic membrane phospholipids after 5 days of E2 treatment. These results indicate that E2-induced changes in pituitary responsiveness might be concomitant with selective effects of the steroid on specific membrane enzymatic activities involved in coupling mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "87053573\r", 
  ".W": "From a single cell fusion, five stable hybridomas secreting antiovine placental lactogen (oPL) antibodies were obtained. Three of these secrete immunoglobulin (Ig)G subclass, and the other two secrete IgM class antibodies. Ascites fluids were raised in mice for each clone and were used as the antibody component for the development of solid phase RIA. Three solid-phase RIAs were successfully established using individual IgG subclass monoclonal antibodies, but the IgM class antibodies were ineffective. In all three individual solid-phase RIAs, the binding of [125I]iodo-oPL to the immobilized antibody was inhibited by unlabeled oPL, but not by ovine pituitary PRL (oPRL), ovine GH (oGH), or ovine pituitary extract. Two of the IgG subclass antibodies were able to inhibit the binding of [125I] iodo-oPL to PRL receptors(s) and to GH receptor(s) in rabbit mammary gland and liver, respectively. One of these two IgG subclass antibodies was more effective at inhibiting the binding of oPL to PRL receptor(s) in rabbit mammary gland, whereas the other one is more effective in inhibiting the binding of oPL to GH receptor(s) in rabbit liver. These antibodies, however, could only weakly inhibit the binding of [125I]iodo-oPRL to rabbit mammary gland and were ineffective in inhibiting the binding of [125I]iodo-oGH to rabbit liver. The addition of monoclonal antibodies in both radioreceptor assay (RRA) for PRL (RRA-PRL) and for GH (RRA-GH) did not affect the parallelism of the displacement curve of oPL standard. Our results suggest that oPL might contain two distinct binding sequence(s): one responsible for the binding of oPL to PRL receptor(s) and the other responsible for the binding of oPL to GH receptor(s). These two binding sequences might overlap or be located adjacent to one another. The interaction of monoclonal antibodies with these binding sequences of oPL may block the binding of oPL with PRL and GH receptor(s). Alternatively, our studies suggest that the monoclonal antibodies do not bind to hormone receptor(s)-binding sequence(s) in oPL, but the interaction between oPL and monoclonal antibody might alter the conformational structure of the oPL which will consequently lead to a lower binding of oPL to PRL and GH receptor(s).\r"

  ".U": "87053574\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that T3 increases adenylate cyclase activity in rat thymocyte plasma membranes by a mechanism that is calcium dependent. In the present studies we have examined whether calmodulin participates in this response to T3. Initial experiments provided evidence that calmodulin is involved in regulating the activity of the guanyl nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase in this tissue. Thus, compared with findings in freshly prepared membranes, dialysis of thymocyte plasma membrane preparations for 20 h at 4 C decreased their calmodulin concentrations from an initial value of approximately 600 ng/100 micrograms protein by about 50% and decreased adenylate cyclase activity by approximately 80%. Although storage of the same preparations under comparable conditions resulted in no change in calmodulin content, it caused an approximate 30% decrease in adenylate cyclase activity. Addition of calmodulin had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity in fresh or stored membrane preparations, but produced a dose-dependent increase in enzyme activity in preparations that had been dialyzed. Further, when added to freshly isolated membranes, three calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine, calmidazolium, and calmodulin antibodies, all produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, and this was completely reversed in all cases by the addition of high concentrations of exogenous calmodulin. The stimulation of guanyl nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase activity that T3 induced in fresh membrane preparations was present in membranes that had been stored, but was absent in those that had been dialyzed. In addition, the response to T3 in fresh membranes was inhibited or abolished by all three calmodulin antagonists. Both in dialyzed membranes and in the presence of antagonists, the response to T3 was restored by the addition of exogenous calmodulin. We conclude that calmodulin influences the activity of the guanyl nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase in rat thymocytes and ultimately mediates the stimulation of enzyme activity that T3 produces. Such mediation very likely explains the calcium-dependent nature of the stimulatory effect of T3 on thymocyte adenylate cyclase activity.\r"

To establish the value of ovariohysterectomy in female beagle dogs as a model for bone loss and to study static and dynamic parameters of bone associated with the negative bone balance occurring after cessation of ovarian function, we performed iliac crest bone biopsies before and 4 months after ovariohysterectomy in eight beagle dogs and in five sham-operated controls. Cessation of ovarian function was documented by an increase in serum levels of LH 4 weeks after ovariohysterectomy. There was no change in serum calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine during the 4 months of the study. Cancellous bone mass and trabecular mean wall thickness decreased significantly after ovariohysterectomy (P less than 0.01). In addition, the number of osteoblasts was increased and the bone formation rate per osteoblast, that is, the activity of bone-forming cells, was decreased (P less than 0.01). Parameters of bone resorption were not significantly altered in the animals with ovariohysterectomy. No changes in histomorphometric parameters of bone structure, formation or resorption were observed in the sham-operated controls. These data indicate that ovariohysterectomy in beagle dogs may serve as a useful model for bone loss associated with cessation of ovarian function. Osteoblastic insufficiency appears to play a major role in the maintenance of bone loss occurring after ovariohysterectomy in beagle dogs.\r"

All animals were prepared with intraatrial Silastic catheters and bled every 15 min for 8 h (0800-1600 h). Normal male littermates displayed a characteristic low frequency, high amplitude pattern of GH secretion with bursts of GH occurring every 2.5-3 h and separated by prolonged trough periods where GH values remained low or undetectable (less than 5 ng/ml) for 45-90 min. Normal female littermates showed a characteristic high frequency, low amplitude pattern of GH secretion with pulses of GH occurring every hour. Compared to normal male littermates, females had lower individual GH peak amplitudes and shortened GH-trough periods which contain higher GH levels. GH-secretory profiles displayed by testicular-feminized animals qualitatively and quantitatively resembled those of the normal female littermates. These data suggest that androgen receptors are necessary for the expression of masculine GH-secretory patterns.\r"

In 21-day-old female rats, E was found to increase MBH DA levels and turnover and serum PRL concentrations in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Changes were observed by 1 day, and after 3 days of E treatment (1 microgram/day), MBH DA levels increased 2-fold (to 1300 pg/mg tissue), and DA turnover rates increased 5-fold (to 1170 pg/mg tissue . h). The AEs tamoxifen, monohydroxytamoxifen, CI628, and LY117018 (50 micrograms/day for 3 days) weakly stimulated uterine weight gain and significantly suppressed the uterotropic action of E. The AEs LY117018, monohydroxytamoxifen, CI628, and tamoxifen competed with E for binding to the MBH estrogen receptor and displayed relative binding affinities of 190%, 185%, 6.7%, and 1.4%, with E set at 100%; these affinities are similar to those found for uterine estrogen receptors. The AEs increased DA turnover rates only 2-fold, and they antagonized the E-induced 5-fold increase in DA turnover rates very successfully. In animals treated with bromocriptine, E and AE failed to increase the low serum PRL levels, yet they evoked significant (approximately 2-fold) increases in DA turnover rates and nearly 2-fold increases in MBH DA content. Hence, a part of the actions of E and AE on MBH DA appears to be exerted independently of changes in circulating PRL and may occur by direct action of these compounds on the estrogen receptor system present in the MBH. In addition, these studies reveal that AEs behave as partial estrogen agonists/antagonists in terms of their effects on MBH DA turnover.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the MCR, volume of distribution, and rapid phase (rt1/2) and slow phase half-lives of purified pituitary rat (r) TSH, TSH from crude pituitary extracts of normal and hypothyroid rats, TSH from hypothyroid rat sera, and TSH secreted from hypothyroid rat pituitaries incubated in vitro. For 3 h after iv bolus injection into euthyroid rats, 125I-labeled rTSH was determined by acid precipitation in serum and various organs, and unlabeled TSH was measured by RIA. The MCR of TSH from normal pituitary extracts (0.53 +/- 0.02 ml/min) was similar to that of unlabeled purified rTSH (0.52 +/- 0.03), while those from hypothyroid pituitary extracts (0.32 +/- 0.03) and hypothyroid sera (0.33 +/- 0.01) were decreased. The reduced MCR of TSH from hypothyroid pituitaries was due to a decreased distribution volume (8.4 +/- 0.6 ml) compared to that from normal pituitaries (11.4 +/- 0.7) and hypothyroid sera (10.9 +/- 0.8). The decreased MCR of circulating TSH from hypothyroid sera reflected an increase in its rt1/2 (12.6 +/- 0.5 min) vs. that from both normal (5.1 +/- 0.5) and hypothyroid (5.7 +/- 0.4) pituitaries. The rt1/2 of secreted TSH from incubated hypothyroid rat pituitaries (8.5 +/- 0.9) was intermediate between those of circulating and pituitary forms of hypothyroid rTSH. The clearances of intact bovine TSH (bTSH) and deglycosylated bTSH (dg-bTSH) were compared. The dg-bTSH MCR was found to be increased (0.71 +/- 0.02 ml/min) compared to that of bTSH (0.59 +/- 0.02), primarily due to a decreased rt1/2 for dg-bTSH (3.8 +/- 0.1 min) vs. bTSH (4.7 +/- 0.2). Uptake of purified [125I]rTSH was highest in the kidney at all times, varying from 43% of the injected dose at 5 min to 54% at 180 min. We conclude that in the euthyroid rat, 1) the metabolic clearance of TSH differs between pituitary and serum forms and appears to depend on specific molecular features that vary with the physiological state of the animal from which the TSH is derived; 2) since chemical deglycosylation increased the clearance of TSH, we speculate that the chemical basis for changes in TSH clearance may be related to alterations in its carbohydrate structure; and 3) for normal pituitary TSH, the kidney is the major organ of clearance.\r"

Double barreled cannulae were implanted unilaterally and bilaterally in the medial preoptic area, anterior hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), central gray, or interpeduncular nucleus. Testing was conducted using a sequential paradigm; facilitation tests commenced after 44 h of estrogen priming. P-filled cannulae placed in the VMH region facilitated lordosis behavior in 42% and 60% of unilaterally and bilaterally implanted females, respectively. In the anterior hypothalamus, only P implants adjacent to the VMH area effectively promoted receptivity. Lordosis behavior was also observed in 20-36% of females with P implants in the medial preoptic area. P implants in central gray and interpeduncular nucleus regions had no significant facilitating effect on sexual behavior. Tests for inhibition occurred 24 h after facilitation testing and consisted of a pretest, followed by systemic P administration and a behavioral test 4-5 h later. During the pretest for inhibition, females that were receptive in the facilitation test attacked males more rapidly than previously nonreceptive animals and showed decrements in lordosis scores after systemic P delivery. This biphasic effect of P completely inhibited receptivity among several animals in the VMH group. Additional experiments, however, investigating the biphasic effect of P implants in the VMH suggested that the occurrence of copulation in the facilitation test may have been involved in mediating the subsequent increase in aggressive behavior and the suppression of sexual responsiveness in the inhibition test. Nevertheless, a final experiment showed that when P was implanted sequentially in the VMH, facilitation and, more importantly, a later reduction in lordosis behavioral scores occurred even when copulation was eliminated in the facilitation test. P implants in mesencephalic regions exerted no significant inhibitory effect on receptivity. These findings demonstrate that the biphasic action of P in the female hamster is regulated by nerve cells located in the diencephalon, especially in the VMH region.\r"

The specific [125I]T3 uptake, determined by subtracting the uptake in the presence of 10 microM unlabeled T3 from the total [125I]T3 uptake, attained a plateau after 60 min. Washout experiments, done by first incubating the muscle for 60 min at 37 C or 0 C with [125I]T3 and then at 0 C for 3 h with unlabeled T3, showed that 21 +/- 2% or 58 +/- 4% of the radioactivity, respectively, was released, indicating an intracellular location of the hormone after incubation at 37 C. Addition of increasing concentrations of L-T3, D-T3 and L-T4 caused a progressive inhibition of the [125I]T3 uptake; the 50% inhibitory concentrations being 400 nM, 7 microM, and more than 15 microM, respectively. Preincubation of soleus muscles with metabolic inhibitors almost completely inhibited [125I]T3 specific uptake, with oligomycin and antimycin causing 98 +/- 4% and 81 +/- 3% reduction, respectively. Monodansylcadaverine and bacitracin, inhibitors of receptor-mediated endocytosis, reduced the specific [125I]T3 uptake in a dose-dependent manner up to 67 +/- 3% and 62 +/- 2%, respectively. These results indicate the presence of a saturable, stereospecific, and energy-dependent process responsible, at least in part, for T3 uptake in rat skeletal muscle. This specific T3 uptake may be a receptor-mediated endocytosis process.\r"

Since estrogens exert major regulatory actions on PRL secretion, the effects of estradiol (E2) on pituitary AII receptors and PRL responses were studied in vivo and in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. In female rats, treatment with E2-containing Silastic capsules for 4 days caused a significant increase in PRA from 1.3 to 3 ng/ml X min and a 38% decrease in the binding of [125I]AII to anterior pituitary membrane-rich fractions (P less than 0.01). In vitro studies showed that treatment of cultured anterior pituitary cells with 1 nM E2 for 4 days caused a 57 +/- 6% decrease in AII receptor concentration with no change in binding affinity. Reduction of AII receptors by E2 in 4-day cultures was dose dependent and was demonstrable with E2 concentrations that occur in plasma during the estrous cycle (0.01-1 nM). The decrease in AII receptors in cells incubated with 1 nM E2 was near maximum after 24 h of culture, and results were similar when receptor concentrations were calculated per unit protein or per cell. Despite the substantial decrease in AII receptors, E2 treatment did not specifically decrease the responsiveness of the pituitary cells to AII stimulation. Thus, PRL responses to AII (10 nM) or TRH (100 nM) were unchanged after 1 day of E2 treatment and were increased after 4 days of treatment. These findings demonstrate that E2 has a direct inhibitory action on expression of pituitary AII receptors that is not accompanied by a decrease in AII-stimulated PRL secretion. In the rat pituitary, estrogen modulation of postreceptor events is the predominant determinant of lactotroph responsiveness during stimulation of PRL release by AII.\r"

Using monoclonal antibodies, we have quantitated and characterized the corresponding proteins of the cell compartment. Using pulse-chase experiments, we have shown that about 40% of the 52K protein is secreted, the majority being successively processed into a 48K and a 34K protein. This last protein is very stable. The processing is inhibited by lysosomotropic agents and leupeptin, suggesting that it occurs in acidic vesicles, such as lysosomes or endosomes. Estradiol increased the intracellular level of immunoreactive 52K related proteins by 4-fold. Its effect is, however, more obvious in the medium, since there is a constitutive level in the cell. The stimulatory effects of estradiol on [3H]mannose and [35S]methionine incorporation into these proteins were similar and the endoglycosydase H sensitivity of the proteins was not altered, suggesting that estradiol did not modulate the glycosylation step. Antiestrogens did not stimulate synthesis and glycosylation of the 52K related proteins. Estradiol also increased the stability of the 52K precursor as well as that of total proteins. We conclude that the secreted 52K protein is the precursor of two cellular proteins of 48K and 34K. Estradiol stimulates both the intracellular accumulation of these proteins and the secretion of the precursor.\r"

  ".W": "Physiological concentrations of L-T4 were found previously to stimulate Ca2+-ATPase activity in vitro in reticulocyte membranes from female rabbits and to inhibit this enzyme in reticulocyte membranes from males. In these previous studies, preincubation of intact cells or ghosts with testosterone (5 X 10(-11) M) converted female-source reticulocyte membranes to male-type responsiveness to thyroid hormone (inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity). Preincubation of reticulocyte membranes with 17 beta-estradiol (5 X 10(-11) M) converted male-source membranes to female-type responsiveness (stimulation by L-T4 of membrane Ca2+-ATPase activity). Using this sex steroid-sensitive thyroid hormone-dependent membrane enzyme system, we investigated the structure-activity relationships of analogs of sex steroids and unrelated steroids. 5 beta-Androstanes were active compared to testosterone in assays using female-source membranes, while 5 alpha-androstanes were less active. Within the 5 beta-androstanes, activity was dependent on at least one hydroxyl group at the C3- or C17-position. Nongonadal steroids tested were less active, establishing specificity of the sex steroid effect in assays using female-source membranes. Assayed in male-source membranes, estrone and 3-hydroxy-1,3,5-(10)7-estratraen-17-one (equilin) were active compared for estrogen effect with 17 beta-estradiol, while estriol was less active. The activities of hydrocortisone and aldosterone were 76% and 71%, respectively, in this system. These structure-activity relationships are distinct from those described for gonadal steroid-cytoplasmic binding proteins or nuclear interactions, and represent a novel sex steroid-thyroid hormone effect on activity of a membrane enzyme.\r"

The effects of cAMP-related drugs on POMC messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were assessed in primary cultures of intermediate (IL) and anterior rat pituitary cells maintained in serum-free medium. 8-Bromo-cAMP (1 mM), but not 8-bromo-cGMP (1 mM), induced a 2-fold increase in IL and anterior lobe cell after 2 days of treatment. A similar increase was obtained with the adenylate cyclase-activating drugs forskolin (1 microM) and cholera toxin (100 ng/ml) or the phosphodiesterase inhibitor RO 20-1724 (100 microM). At 48 h, all these treatments had increased beta-endorphin accumulation in the medium and transiently decreased the cellular beta-endorphin content in IL cells, suggesting a parallel effect of cAMP-related drugs on secretion and biosynthesis. Incubating the cells with the Ca++ channel antagonists D600 (50 microM), verapamil (50 microM), and the dihydropyridine nifedipine (0.1 microM) decreased basal POMC mRNA levels, whereas the dihydropyridine BAYK 8644 (0.1 microM), which activates the Ca++ channel, increased POMC mRNA levels after 2 days. In addition, nifedipine decreased the stimulatory effect of forskolin, whereas BAYK 8644 further stimulated the forskolin-increased POMC mRNA levels in IL cells. We conclude that both Ca++ and cAMP may regulate the gene expression of POMC.\r"

However, the source(s) and specific action(s) of calcium in the secretory process have not been identified. Also undefined are the mechanisms by which regulators of PRL cell function may alter calcium distribution. In the present investigation, the elevation of medium K+ concentration during static incubations to a depolarizing concentration (56 mM) produced no change in cumulative PRL release over control levels during the 18-20 h of incubation. During perifusion incubation, exposure to high K+ concentrations briefly stimulated (less than or equal to 10 min) and then depressed PRL release. In contrast, reduced medium osmotic pressure elicited a rapid elevation in PRL release that was sustained for 2 h or more. D600, a calcium entry blocker, at 10(-5) M diminished the K+-induced pulses of PRL release. The same concentration, however, did not alter the release of PRL evoked by reduced osmotic pressure. In contrast, CoCl2, which blocks a range of calcium-mediated processes in addition to calcium influx, suppressed PRL release during perifusion and static incubations in hyposmotic medium. These findings suggest that while PRL secretion from the tilapia pituitary is calcium dependent, calcium entry through voltage-regulated plasmalemma channels may not be a prerequisite to the actions of reduced osmotic pressure.\r"

Using the photoperiodic Djungarian hamster, we assessed the role of the maternal pineal gland and its hormone, melatonin, in this prenatal perception of daylength. Maternal pinealectomy eliminated the influence of prenatal photoperiod on testicular and body weights of male pups, suggesting that a product from the maternal pineal gland communicates daylength to the fetus. Infusion of the pineal hormone melatonin into pinealectomized dams for various durations during gestation mimicked the effect of varying the prenatal photoperiod on both testicular and body weights. These results indicate that pineal melatonin is involved in this novel form of communication from mother to fetus.\r"

The assay exhibited exquisite sensitivity (156 fg rat PRL per assay slide) and could be used to evaluate the biopotency of PRL released from individual cells. By combining this \"plaque bioassay\" with a standard plaque assay for measuring the secretion of immunoreactive PRL, it was possible to compare the bio- and immuno-potencies of hormone released from the same pituitary cells. The results of three separate studies revealed major differences among PRL secretors in these potency estimates. Given the existence of PRL variants with different biological and immunological efficacies, these findings suggest that PRL cells differ from one another in the molecular form(s) of hormone released.\r"

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis and autoradiography of purified receptor, radioiodinated receptor, and affinity-labeled receptor all indicated a molecular mass of approximately 250K. Scatchard analysis of IGF-II binding to purified receptor, solubilized microsomal membranes, or plasma membranes showed a single class of binding site with an affinity constant of 6 X 10(10) liter/mol in all cases. Potent antibodies to the purified receptor were raised in rabbits, capable of inhibiting 50% of IGF-II binding at dilutions of 1:170,000 and also of fully precipitating IGF-II-prelabeled receptor at 1:50,000. Both types of antibodies reacted with IGF-II receptors in rat adipose tissue, brain, heart, kidney, lung, and spleen. However, little cross-reactivity was seen with other species.

Mouse thyrotropic tumor tissue, or pituitaries from euthyroid or hypothyroid mice, were incubated with D-[2-3H]Man, homogenized, and incubated in the presence or absence of pH 3 buffer to dissociate heterodimers. Highly enriched TSH beta-subunits, or TSH heterodimers, were obtained using anti-TSH beta serum and free alpha-subunits were subsequently obtained using anti-LH alpha-serum. High Man units released by endoglycosidase H were analyzed by paper chromatography. At 1 and 3 h oligosaccharides with 8 or 9 Man residues predominated in all subunits. In all three tissue types, units with 9 Man tended to accumulate in TSH beta-subunits, whereas Man-trimming from Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc proceeded more rapidly in TSH alpha-subunits, and in free alpha-subunits. The rate of TSH beta-subunit processing was also a function of tissue type; the rate in euthyroid pituitary tissue equaled that in tumor tissue and was greater than that in hypothyroid pituitary tissue, suggesting that processing may be physiologically regulated. Hypothyroid calf serum slowed TSH alpha-subunit processing in euthyroid pituitaries. Thus, the previously reported slower processing of Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc in heterodimers as compared to free alpha-subunits is in large part due to accumulation of Man9GlcNAc in TSH beta-subunits.\r"

  ".W": "It is well known that LH and human CG (hCG) induce an increase in total ovarian blood flow. The effect of LH/hCG on luteal blood flow, however, is unknown. This work studies the effect of hCG on both luteal and ovarian blood flows at different stages of pseudopregnancy in adult female rats. Pseudopregnancy was induced by mating with sterile male rats. The length of pseudopregnancy was 13 +/- 1 days and, during this time, blood flow was measured by the injection of radioactive microspheres during anesthesia. At autopsy, the corpora lutea were identified and extirpated under a stereomicroscope. These, and the remaining ovary, were then counted for radioactivity and the blood flow was calculated. Progesterone levels were determined in plasma and ovarian tissues. Furthermore, the responsiveness of adenylate cyclase was tested in ovarian tissues at day 6 of pseudopregnancy. An intraarterial injection of hCG (50 IU) or vehicle (saline) was given 20 min before the blood flow determinations in anesthetized rats. The luteal blood flow was not changed by hCG on days 2, 6, and 11 of pseudopregnancy, whereas in the remaining ovary the blood flow increased more than 2-fold, thereby resulting in redistribution of the blood flow. Ten micrograms of NIH-LH-B9, tested at day 6 of pseudopregnancy, mimicked the effect of hCG. At day 6 of pseudopregnancy, hCG (50 IU) was given ip to conscious rats 200 min and 24 h before blood flow determinations. At 200 min after hCG there was a more pronounced redistribution of ovarian blood flow with a 45% reduction in luteal blood flow and a 4-fold increase in flow through the remaining ovary. LH as well as hCG doubled the progesterone content of the remaining ovary. In the corpora lutea an increased progesterone content was seen after 200 min of hCG exposure. At 24 h after hCG injection, all parameters had returned to control levels except that adenylate cyclase was nonresponsive. The increase in the total ovarian blood flow coincides with the increased steroidogenesis and these effects are likely due to release of metabolites and/or vasoactive substances. Despite this increase, the blood flow of the corpus luteum was not increased rendering vascular mechanisms unlikely as a part of the acute LH/hCG effects on corpus luteum of pseudopregnancy.\r"

Both IGF-I and IGF-II are potent stimulators of amino acid uptake, cell proliferation, and differentiation; they also suppress protein degradation in these cells. In all measurements, the relative potencies are IGF-I greater than IGF-II greater than insulin. Two recombinant DNA-produced analogs of IGF-I, (Thr59)IGF-I and (N-Met)IGF-I, were as active as native IGF-I in all four assays. However, when 125I-labeled hormones were used for studies of binding to IGF receptors, there was a striking difference between the native and recombinant IGF-I molecules. Both were bound significantly by the type I receptor (a 350K molecule that is dissociated upon sulfhydryl reduction), but the recombinant analogs exhibited little cross-reactivity with the type II receptor (a 220K molecule that is not dissociated by reduction). Thus, the equal activity of native IGF-I and its recombinant DNA-produced analogs coupled with the higher potency of IGF-I (compared to IGF-II) suggest that the type II receptor plays little or no role in the four actions of the somatomedins studied in L6 myoblasts.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were designed to characterize constitutive steroidogenesis in Leydig tumor cells. Constitutive steroidogenesis was investigated by comparing constitutively active R2C Leydig tumor cells to trophic hormone-responsive MA-10 Leydig tumor cells. Unlike the MA-10 cells, R2C cells appeared to synthesize steroid hormones independently of the cAMP-protein kinase pathway. Although the adenylate cyclase of R2C cells could be stimulated in the expected manner by cholera toxin, cAMP concentrations in these cells were low, and R2C cell steroidogenesis could be dissociated from other cAMP-dependent processes. Two cAMP-dependent processes in steroidogenic cells, protein kinase activation and lactate formation, showed low basal activities in R2C cells and could be stimulated by (Bu)2cAMP with a dose dependence similar to that detected in MA-10 cells. Steroid hormone biosynthesis parallelled these other cAMP-dependent processes in MA-10 cells, but not in R2C cells. Cycloheximide, however, caused similar dose-dependent inhibition of steroidogenesis in both the R2C and MA-10 cells. Using a cell component bioassay, it was shown that R2C cells constitutively synthesize an extramitochondrial cycloheximide-sensitive factor that is functionally identical to the factor produced in response to hCG in MA-10 cells. This factor enhanced mitochondrial pregnenolone biosynthesis. Thus, constitutive steroidogenesis in R2C cells could be explained by the cAMP-independent but cycloheximide-sensitive constitutive production of an extramitochondrial factor that activated mitochondrial pregnenolone biosynthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Although an action of corticosteroids to inhibit glucose transport is well known, the mechanism by which this is brought about has been unclear. Some evidence has suggested an action on insulin receptors, but a postbinding or postreceptor effect has also been reported. As hydrogen peroxide acts at a postbinding site to stimulate glucose transport, studies were carried out in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to determine whether corticosteroids would inhibit hydrogen peroxide-induced glucose transport. In this cell type, both insulin and hydrogen peroxide produced a marked increase in glucose transport after a 30-min incubation. The increase produced by hydrogen peroxide, as well as insulin, was inhibited by previous incubation of the cells with dexamethasone. These findings give further support to the conclusion that dexamethasone has effects on glucose transport at a postbinding site. As changes in membrane lipids influence the movement and/or activity of glucose transporters, and dexamethasone alters membrane lipids, dexamethasone-induced changes in the lipids of the plasma membrane may be important in the mediation of the steroid effect upon glucose transport.\r"

The mol wt of this peptide is about 25,000, as determined by gel filtration chromatography and immunoblot analysis of samples resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing indicated that the isoelectric point of this peptide was near neutrality. However, a smaller peptide of mol wt 8,000 that cross-reacted with antibodies to Sm-C/IGF-I, was released after gel filtration in acetic acid. Similarly, reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column under acidic conditions released a Sm-C/IGF-I immunoreactive peptide of 8,000 mol wt. This smaller species apparently resulted from the dissociation of this peptide from a binding protein. Unlike the larger neutral form, the isoelectric point of the smaller peptide was 9.8. This pI is similar to the GH-dependent Sm-C/IGF-I peptide isolated from rat serum. The small peptide, unlike the larger form, reacted in a parallel manner to human Sm-C/IGF-I in the Sm-C/IGF-I RIA and radioreceptor assays. In addition, the 8,000 mol wt peptide behaved as a progression factor in the BALB/c-3T3 assay and competed with [125I]Sm-C/IGF-I for binding to the type I Sm-C/IGF-I receptor from cultured rat Sertoli cells. In summary, results of this study demonstrate that rat Sertoli cells in culture secrete a peptide that is the rat equivalent of human Sm-C/IGF-I.\r"

It is known from previous studies that the content of cholesterol in the inner zone is considerably lower than that in the outer zone, although basal low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity is similar in the two zones. To further explore cholesterol metabolism in the guinea pig adrenal cortex, the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, has been examined for which this paper forms the initial report. It was found that the basal specific activity of HMG-CoA reductase was similar in the outer and inner adrenocortical zones (approximately 230 pmol mevalonate formed/min X mg microsomal protein). The administration of ACTH caused 4- and 5-fold increases in HMG-CoA reductase activity in the outer and inner zones, respectively. In fact, the increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity with ACTH treatment was always greater for the inner zone than for the outer zone. This is in contrast to LDL receptor activity, which does not increase in the inner zone as it does in the outer zone with ACTH treatment. When dexamethasone was administered, HMG-CoA reductase activity decreased in the outer zone by about 50%, while there was no change in reductase activity in the inner zone. The latter finding is similar to what happens with LDL receptor activity during dexamethasone administration. Why suppression of endogenous ACTH had no effect on HMG-CoA reductase activity in the inner zone while exogenous ACTH administration caused a marked increase in enzyme activity is not clear, but may be related to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms. Based on the use of sodium fluoride in solutions to block HMG-CoA reductase phosphatase, evidence is presented which indicates that a pharmacological dose of ACTH alters the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation status of HMG-CoA reductase in the inner adrenocortical zone, but not in the outer cortical zone.\r"

In each species studied there was evidence for species-specific deviations from the rat model. The most pronounced differences were observed with respect to the conversion of dynorphin A-(1-17) to dynorphin A-(1-8). In rodents, rats, and guinea pigs, under steady state conditions, the molar ratios of these forms are approximately 1:2 and 2.5:1, respectively. However, in the pig and rhesus monkey, the molar ratios of these forms are 10:1 and 14:1, respectively. Thus, under steady state conditions, the conversion of dynorphin A-(1-17) to dynorphin A-(1-8) appears to be a minor event in porcine and rhesus monkey posterior pituitary. Species-specific variations were also observed with respect to the steady state levels of alpha-neo-endorphin and dynorphin B-(1-13). In addition, the results of these studies suggest that the conversion of prodynorphin-derived opioids to leu-enkephalin probably represents a minor event in the species studied.\r"

Pituitary glands from both sexes at different ages were monodispersed with 0.1% trypsin. Freshly dispersed cells were incubated in Cunningham chambers for measurement of the fraction of plaque-forming cells and the size of plaques formed, or attached to glass slides for measurement of the fraction of cells staining for PRL by ICC. The percentage of plaque-forming cells in both sexes gradually increased with age from about 5% of the total anterior pituitary cell population at 5 days of age to the adult levels of about 54% in the females at proestrus and about 37% in the males. Sexual differences in the percentage of plaque-forming cells were consistently seen at 40 days of age and thereafter. The mean size of plaques in both sexes also increased with age from about 1,100 microns 2 at 5 days of age to a peak level of about 15,600 microns 2 in the females at proestrus and about 6,700 microns 2 in the males at 60 days of age; then fell to the adult levels of about 5,500 microns 2 in the females at proestrus and about 3,200 microns 2 in males. Sexual differences first appeared at 40 days of age and were estrogen-dependent. The results from ICC closely matched those from the plaque assay, except at 5 days of age and in the adult males. At 5 days, the fraction of cells staining for PRL was twice that of cells forming plaques. In adult male rats there were about 47% immunostained PRL cells but only about 39% plaque-forming cells. This difference, however, disappeared after estrogen treatment. These results demonstrate that sexual differences in the lactotrope population develop around puberty in rats and appear to be estrogen dependent.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated acute effects of 17 beta-estradiol (E) on ions, cyclic nucleotides, and catecholamines and their association with temporal changes in uterine secretory products in pregnant, cyclic, and nonpregnant gilts. Uterine flushings (UTF) and endometrium (ENDOM) from one uterine horn of nonpregnant and pregnant gilts (n = 9) were collected on days 10, 12, and 14 (n = 3). Protein, plasma inhibitor (P less than 0.05), Na+, and K+ (P less than 0.01) increased linearly in UTF of pregnant gilts. Ca2+ changed biphasically, with higher concentrations (P less than 0.01) in pregnant gilts on day 12. Endometrial cAMP and cGMP (P less than 0.05) increased between days 12 and 14 of pregnancy. The UTF norepinephrine (NE) concentrations increased (P less than 0.01) in cyclic gilts between days 12 and 14, while endometrial NE increased between days 10 and 12 and then decreased on day 14. The UTF of pregnant gilts had higher (P less than 0.05) concentrations of dopamine (DA), which peaked on day 12 and then decreased (P less than 0.01) by day 14. DA in UTF of nonpregnant gilts decreased between days 10 and 12 and remained low on day 14. A catecholamine metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, in ENDOM (P less than 0.05) and UTF (P less than 0.01) decreased linearly between days 10 and 14. The turnover rate of endometrial catecholamines was 2.4-fold higher (P less than 0.05) during early pregnancy compared with that in cyclic gilts. Effects of acute administration of exogenous E (0.5 mg) were also studied. The UTF and ENDOM were from day 11 nonpregnant gilts 0, 30, 60, and 360 min (n = 3) post-E or post-saline-ethanol (C) injection (n = 9). Potassium, plasma inhibitor (P less than 0.01), and cGMP (P less than 0.05) increased rapidly (30 min) after E injection. The K+ level changed biphasically, with increased concentrations again at 360 min. Plasmin inhibitor returned to levels similar to controls by 60 min, whereas cGMP remained elevated until 360 min postinjection when E, Ca2+, K+ (P less than 0.01), and Na+ (P less than 0.03) were increased. ENDOM NE (P less than 0.05) and UTF DA (P less than 0.05) were lower in E-treated gilts. Additionally, the turnover rate was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) for NE and DA in the UTF of E-treated gilts. An increase in Ca2+ in UTF preceded increases in protein secretions (except plasmin inhibitor) and may play a role in E-stimulated endometrial epithelial secretory vesicle exocytosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We have examined the effects of five other estrogens: estriol, estrone, 17 alpha-estradiol, and the metabolism-resistant analogs ethynyl estradiol and moxestrol. All were full agonists for both effects, and all were more potent for the stimulation of cell growth than for stimulation of PRL production. The order of analog potency for both biological effects was the same as the order of potency for inhibiting saturable [3H]estradiol binding to intact cells. Therefore, both biological effects appear to be mediated through the same receptor, and metabolism of 17 beta-estradiol is unlikely to account for the difference in the concentrations required to elicit the two effects. We selected two estrogen-responsive clones from a cDNA library made from GH4C1 cells. The clones were chosen because they were induced at the estrogen concentrations that stimulate growth. Estradiol caused maximal stimulation of the mRNAs corresponding to the two recombinant clones at 10(-10) M, a concentration over 10-fold lower than that required for maximal stimulation of PRL mRNA. These data indicate that a difference in sensitivity to estrogen occurs at the level of mRNA accumulation as well as at the level of the biological responses.\r"

Sc from 14- and 18-day-old rats were maintained for 13 days in one of the following media: Modified Eagle's Medium-Ham's F-12 (DFM), DFM plus insulin, epidermal growth factor, progesterone, hydrocortisone, and vitamins A and E (6F), 6F plus testosterone (7F), 7F plus FSH (8F), 6F plus 2% fetal bovine serum (6F2S), 6F plus 5% fetal bovine serum (6F5S). The monolayer permeability to [3H]inulin decreased rapidly during the initial 3-5 days of culture for the Sc isolated from 18- and 14-day old animals, then remained stable in all media except DFM. Morphological examination revealed the presence of tight junctions between neighbouring Sc in both age groups, indicating their de novo formation. Secretion of Trf was lowest in DFM and steadily declined. In all other media, Trf secretion peaked on day 5 and remained relatively constant after day 7. Medium 7F only slightly and inconsistently increased the secretion, whereas 8F was always highly stimulatory compared to 6F. Supplementation of 6F with serum resulted in the greatest Trf secretion. In the case of ABP, three different secretion patterns were noted depending on the medium composition; secretion was greatest in the presence of 5% fetal bovine serum. The medium supplements also differentially affected the polarity of Trf and ABP secretion. The ratio of Trf secreted to the outer and inner compartments (OC/IC) was approximately 2.0 in DFM and was not influenced by supplements in 6F, 7F, and 8F. However, in serum-containing media, the OC/IC ratio gradually increased with time to about 5.0 on day 13. The average OC/IC ratio of ABP was 1.7 in DFM and, in contrast to Trf, declined to 0.7 in other serum-free media. Serum supplementation reversed and increased the ABP ratio to about 6.0 on day 13. These data indicate that Sc grown on permeable supports form confluent monolayers that limit the diffusion of macromolecules, most likely due to the formation of tight junctions. The monolayer permeability as well as the total and polarized secretion of Trf and ABP are differentially regulated by hormones and serum factors.\r"

Controls received either 0.01 M PBS (1 ml, im; n = 2) or 0.01 M gel-PBS (gel; 1 ml, os; n = 2) in cervical os. One relaxin-treated (im) heifer calved at 4 h and 36 min after treatment; thus, data from this heifer were not included in subsequent analysis. Relaxin-treated heifers showed an acute elevation in relaxin, a precipitous decrease in progesterone, and a significant (P less than 0.05) elevation of E1 and 17 beta-E2. Plasma relaxin levels were 4.95, 1.5, and 0.24 ng/ml at 0.5 h in RLX-IM, RLX-OS, and control animals, respectively. Peripheral plasma relaxin peaked between 23-31 ng/ml 1-2.5 h before returning to less than 0.5 ng/ml 5-12 h after treatment. Relaxin administration accounted for 70%, 73%, and 58% of the progesterone, E1, and 17 beta-E2 variability between treatments, respectively. An abrupt decrease (P less than 0.01) in progesterone preceded the rises (P less than 0.05) in E1 and 17 beta-E2 at 1.5, 2-2.5, and 2-3.5 h, respectively. Maximum progesterone deviations from the pretreatment mean concentration were -5.43, -3.05, and -0.92 ng/ml for RLX-IM, RLX-OS, and controls. Progesterone rebounded from 36% to 61% and 62% to 79% of respective pretreatment means for RLX-IM and RLX-OS. Peak elevation of E1 was 407.3, 306.5, and 71.5 pg/ml and that of 17 beta-E2 was 82.2, 35.8, and 7.8 ng/ml for RLX-IM, RLX-OS, and controls, respectively. These results provide strong evidence that a pharmacological dosage of relaxin induces an acute depression of progesterone secretion beginning within 90 min in beef heifers during late pregnancy. We suggest that these early and marked luteolytic effects of relaxin on progesterone secretion in cattle could be by direct or indirect actions via mechanisms that are yet unknown.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the localization of nuclear T3 receptors in adult rat brain, we have developed a technique for separating neuronal and glial nuclei, and compared nuclear T3 binding in both fractions. Glial and neuronal nuclear populations were prepared by homogenization of the whole brain except the cerebellum, followed by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation in 2.4 and 2.2 M sucrose. For purposes of comparison, liver nuclei were prepared by centrifugation in 2.4 M sucrose. Microscopic examination of the nuclei confirmed the purity of the two nuclear fractions to be above 90% with minimal extranuclear contamination. T3 binding studies were performed on the washed nuclear fractions using saturation analysis techniques. Maximum binding (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) were obtained by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis. After 30 min incubation at 37 C, Bmax in neuronal nuclei was 1203 +/- 118 fmol/mg DNA (mean +/- SE) (n = 6), in comparison with 196 +/- 14 fmol/mg DNA in glial nuclei (n = 7). The corrected value for Bmax in glial nuclei, assuming 8% neuronal nuclear contamination, was 100 fmol/mg DNA. Bmax in liver nuclei was contamination, was 100 fmol/mg DNA. Bmax in liver nuclei was 299 +/- 38 fmol/mg DNA (n = 6). The Kd values were 0.38 +/- 0.04 nM, 0.34 +/- 0.05 nM, and 0.33 +/- 0.04 nM in neuronal, glial, and liver nuclei, respectively. The specificity of T3 binding to the nuclear receptor in both neuronal and glial nuclei was studied in competition studies, and revealed closely similar relative binding affinities (T3 greater than T4 greater than rT3) in both. We conclude that the higher T3 binding capacity of neuronal nuclei may be related to their higher protein synthetic ability, suggesting that T3 may be of importance in a rapid structural turnover in these cells. The effect of T3 on myelination in glial cells may be mediated through the nucleus.\r"

In the first experiment, short day anestrous females were transferred to long days to detect hormonal changes associated with recovery of cyclicity. Morning and afternoon blood samples were taken at increasing durations in long days. Females autopsied at their first vaginal estrus after transfer to long days differed from long day estrous controls only in their lower uterine weights. Some females at all durations exhibited signs of recovery, though they had not yet shown estrus. They did not display afternoon gonadotropin surges and had low circulating progesterone but high estradiol levels, stimulated uteri, and enhanced follicular development. Results of the second and third experiments provided evidence that the daily gonadotropin surges are not the cause per se of anestrus, and that changes in estrogen secretion are essential for the transition to and from anestrus. Phenobarbital blockade of the daily surges in anestrous females did not result in increased follicular growth and estrogen secretion. Furthermore, daily afternoon injections of gonadotropins it appears that the daily surges in anestrous hamsters simply reflect low estradiol levels. It is still not known what signal promotes rapid follicular maturation during the recovery from anestrus. Once initiated, however, this recovery appears to occur within a few days, with a rapid cascade of events. First, follicular development and estrogen secretion resume, and the daily LH surges cease. Then, progesterone levels decline, and an ovulatory surge of gonadotropins is triggered.\r"

Although recent studies suggest that variants of TSH deficient in carbohydrate occur naturally, the significance of the carbohydrate moiety of TSH in respect to its thyrotropic function is unclear. The present studies were undertaken, therefore, to examine this question. A highly purified preparation of bovine TSH (bTSH) was deglycosylated by treatment with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Amino acid and carbohydrate analyses of the original and deglycosylated preparations indicated that approximately 85% of the carbohydrate originally present had been removed and that the protein moiety was unaltered. As judged from TSH radioreceptor assays, bTSH and deglycosylated bTSH (dg-bTSH) bound to human thyroid membranes with equal affinity, since both caused a half-maximal inhibition of [125I]bTSH binding at approximately equal concentrations. Nonetheless, dg-bTSH at optimal concentration displayed only about one third the activity of intact TSH in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity in human thyroid membranes. dg-bTSH also antagonized the adenylate cyclase-stimulating activity of intact bTSH in this system, but only weakly, since abolition of the bTSH effect required an approximately 40-fold higher concentration of dg-bTSH. In cultures of FRTL5 cells, a cloned line of follicular cells derived from normal rat thyroid, both intact and dg-bTSH enhanced cell growth, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation and stimulated cAMP release in the medium, but the response elicited by dg-bTSH was much less than that caused by equal concentrations of the intact hormone. In accord with the findings in the in vitro assays, dg-bTSH evoked a much smaller response than bTSH did in the in vivo mouse assay. It is concluded that although not required for receptor recognition, the carbohydrate moiety of bTSH is essential for the full expression of its biological activity.\r"

In vitro incubation of granules with reduced glutathione (GSH) results in the production of monomeric hormones and increased hormone release. We tested the hypothesis that increases in intragranular osmolality due to conversion of oligomers to lower mol wt forms are key to granule rupture. Hormone release was measured after granule incubations in medium made hyperosmotic by the addition of raffinose or sucrose. PRL release at pH 7.8 with 0.7 M raffinose was reduced to 43.5% of the control value, whereas GH release ranged from 70-100% of the control value. Augmented release stimulated by 2 mM GSH was also diminished by raffinose, to 17.9% (PRL) and 75.6% (GH) of control values. The IC50 for raffinose inhibition of PRL release was 0.62 M; this shifted to 0.38 M in the presence of 2 mM GSH. Raffinose also blunted the granule response to GSH at all other GSH concentrations tested and decreased stimulated release at pH 9 as well as at 7.8. Interference with the ability to maintain an osmotic gradient, a maneuver accomplished by partial disruption of granule membranes with 0.5% deoxycholate treatment, reduced or abolished the raffinose inhibition. Molecular sizing of granule fractions on Superose-6 (Pharmacia) indicated that PRL monomers remaining in the pelletable granule fraction increased with raffinose about 2-fold under both basal and GSH-stimulated conditions. These data support the concept that thiol:disulfide equilibria may be important in PRL and GH storage and secretion by their influence on intragranular osmolality. In exocytosis in vivo, osmotically mediated granule rupture may be triggered by thiols during granule:plasma membrane fusion.\r"

The chicks were fed for 3 weeks a vitamin D-deficient diet but were supplemented with radioactive labeled vitamin D3. The chicks were then divided into two groups. In the first group the right tibia was fractured, whereas the second group served as nonfractured control group. During the following days of fracture healing, the metabolites of [3H]vitamin D3 were measured in callus, epiphysis, diaphysis, plasma, duodenum, and kidney. Histological examination of calluses and bones, measurements of intestinal absorption of calcium, and renal production of dihydroxylated metabolites of vitamin D3 were performed as well. The levels of the dihydroxylated metabolites were increased in the calluses and the levels of [3H]24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were found to coincide with the formation of cartilaginous tissue and with the renal production of this steroid. In the duodenum of the fractured chicks, the levels of [3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 dropped significantly during the first week after fracture, coinciding with reduction in the intestinal absorption of calcium. In the plasma during those 3 weeks of healing process the levels of [3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were far below normal. These findings indicate that during the process of fracture repair, changes in the metabolism and expression of vitamin D are taking place in order to meet the new requirements of the body under stress condition of skeletal fracture.\r"

Treatment of BT20 cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 results in a 30% decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity of the embryonic isoenzyme. There was a 2-fold increase in activity after treatment with HC, and enzyme activity was similar to control values after treatment with both hormones.

Increases in enzyme activity were inhibited when the cells were incubated simultaneously with the steroids and cycloheximide. Studies with receptors in each cell line showed that both cell lines bound 1,25-(OH)2D3 and that a 1,25-(OH)2D3-binding protein with the same mol wt as the D3 receptor was present in both. The BT20 cells also express a larger mol wt protein which binds 1,25-(OH)2D3 but is not as specific for the 1,25-(OH)2D3 isomer. HC receptors were similar in quantity and binding affinity in both cell lines.\r"

Radioautographs of two-dimensional gels of the in vitro translational products of RNA were quantitated by computer-assisted videodensitometry and analyzed by multivariate statistics. Of the 250 spots observed, each presumably representing the translational product of a separate messenger RNA, 21 were responsive to changes in hormonal state. Eighteen increased and two decreased at some stage in the transition from the hypothyroid to the hyperthyroid state. One spot changed in a biphasic manner. Eight products responded to the lipogenic diet, six increasing and two decreasing. Six of these eight spots responded in a similar fashion to thyroid hormone administration. As previously shown for liver, there appears to be a substantial overlap between the genomic response to carbohydrate and thyroid hormone administration. Whereas the carbohydrate-generated changes are largely included in the thyroid-hormone induced alterations, the majority of thyroid hormone responsive changes are not duplicated by the diet. Multivariate analysis showed a clear separation of each state from the others and revealed that it was necessary to monitor only nine spots to achieve an effective separation of the states analyzed.\r"

  ".W": "The amount and sources of T3 associated with high affinity, low capacity cellular nuclear receptors in brown adipose tissue (BAT) have been estimated by in vivo pulse-labeling techniques. Maximal binding capacity was measured by in vivo saturation analysis. Nuclear receptor occupancy at endogenous levels of T3 and T4 in euthyroid rats was estimated from the equilibrium nuclear to serum ratio of tracer T3, and the locally generated nuclear T3 to serum T4 ratio after injecting tracer T3 and T4. These ratios were multiplied, respectively, by the endogenous concentrations of T3 and T4 as measured by RIA. The maximal binding capacity was 0.65 ng T3/mg DNA, and saturation was 71%. Fifty-five percent of the nuclear T3 was generated locally, and 45% was derived from circulating T3. BAT is, hence, comparable to the liver in number of receptors (approximately 5000/cell) and to the pituitary with regard to saturation and relative contributions of locally generated T3 and plasma T3 to nuclear T3. These results suggest that BAT may be an important target for thyroid hormones and, along with other data, that alterations in the activity of the type II 5'-deiodinase of this tissue may influence the saturation of nuclear T3 receptors.\r"

After drinking 2% NaCl for 2 weeks, a 2-fold increase in the OT mRNA content was found by Northern blot analysis of microdissected supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN). The same samples showed a similar change in vasopressin (VP) mRNA levels. This treatment resulted in a 70% depletion of both OT and VP from the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland and a marked increase in OT and VP plasma levels. Analysis of the OT mRNA concentration by quantitative in situ hybridization showed that the SON, PVN, and anterior commissural nucleus responded similarly, with a 1.5-fold increase in OT mRNA after 7 days of osmotic stimulation. These results demonstrate that OT gene expression in the magnocellular neurons of the SON, PVN, and anterior commissural nucleus is sensitive to this osmotic stimulus, as is the VP gene of magnocellular neurons in the SON and PVN. The responsiveness of OT-producing neurons may point to a role for OT in the regulation of water and electrolyte balance.\r"

  ".U": "87053662\r", 
  ".W": "One of the earliest responses of the thyroid cells to TSH is macropinocytosis with formation of intracellular colloid droplets. We demonstrate here that increasing stimulation with TSH not only elicits a highly individual macropinocytotic response among different follicular cells but that the fraction of TSH-responsive cells is also a function of the TSH dose. After pretreatment with T4, mice and rats were injected ip with bovine TSH and killed 2 h later. The macropinocytotic response to TSH was evaluated on periodic acid-Schiff-stained 3-microns sections of the thyroids in terms of droplet number per 25 follicles and, in addition, by assessing recruitment, i.e. percentage of droplet-containing cells. Both variables increased with increasing TSH stimulation until they reached a plateau at about 9 mU TSH in mice and at about 300 mU TSH in rats: the percentage of droplet-containing cells gradually increased in mice from 2% (no TSH) to 67% (9 mU TSH) and in rats from 11% (no TSH) to 54% (300 mU TSH). Overall pinocytotic response as well as thyrocyte recruitment could be modified by extra- and intrathyroidal factors: for example, pretreatment of the mice with an iodine-deficient diet increased the maximal percentage of droplet containing cells to nearly 90%. Obviously, two separate components of the macropinocytotic response of the thyroid gland to TSH can be distinguished: the first is the gradually increasing fraction of droplet-containing cells, the second is the well known increase of the number of colloid droplets in each TSH-responsive cell with progressive TSH stimulation. Recruitment of thyrocytes with a gradually increasing natural threshold to a hormonal stimulus appears to be a fundamental mechanism in the thyroid gland and possibly in other organs.\r"

Both seizure severity and susceptibility may be determined by noradrenergic deficits in the telencephalon, midbrain, and pons-medulla. Seizure severity but not susceptibility may be determined by noradrenergic abnormalities in the cerebellum.\r"

In the sixth case, the appropriate anticonvulsant was used, but it induced multiple astatic-myoclonic seizures. This phenomenon of drug-induced seizures is apt to occur particularly in certain types of childhood epilepsy that are refractory to therapy and are accompanied by slow spike-wave discharges in the EEG, such as the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.\r"

The density of IEDs peaked during non-REM stages and was significantly reduced during REM stage. Mean plasma PRL concentrations in epileptic patients, when sampled at 30-min intervals, showed a moderate but significant elevation during non-REM (p less than 0.001) and awake stages (p less than 0.005), but not during REM stage, when compared with 10 nonepileptic control subjects studied in a similar fashion. The data obtained in this physiologically controlled environment indicate that the cumulative effect of IEDs may modify PRL regulatory mechanisms, resulting in a modest elevation of plasma concentrations independent of ictal discharges.\r"

The percentage of partial seizures (67%) was significantly increased in proportion to a series of 100 adult epilepsy patients, with a comparable age distribution. In 10 patients (including three patients with symptomatic epilepsy), the attacks appeared before the MS symptoms. The mean follow-up after the first seizures was 19.3 years. In 10 patients, the seizures disappeared totally during the surveillance until September 1985. Our results show an increased comorbidity between MS and epilepsy. In most cases, however, the prognosis of epilepsy was good and there seemed not to be any clear correlation between the severity of MS and epilepsy.\r"

Subjects were 132 students from teacher-training colleges. After all treatments, attitudes, and knowledge about epilepsy were changed in a positive way. Treatments were found to be equally effective. Before treatment, direct behavioral experiences were related to knowledge and a more positive attitude towards epilepsy. After treatment, subjects with direct behavioral experiences with epilepsy showed less change of attitude and knowledge as compared with subjects with indirect experiences.

Male deficits were more marked after diagnosis; female deficits were more marked before diagnosis.

Results of the multiple regression analyses indicated a modest combined predictive significance of the demographic and clinical seizure variables for academic performance. In addition, the magnitude of these relationships varied by academic area. Among the individual variables examined the strongest correlates of academic performance were age of the child, age of seizure onset, lifetime total seizure frequency, and presence of multiple seizures (absence and tonic-clonic). These results are discussed in relation to developing an understanding of the factors which underlie academic vulnerability in children with epilepsy.\r"
