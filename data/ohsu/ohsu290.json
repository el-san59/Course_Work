  ".W": "In this review of a collected series of patients undergoing hepatic resection for colorectal metastases, 100 patients were found to have survived greater than five years from the time of resection. Of these 100 long-term survivors, 71 remain disease-free through the last follow-up, 19 recurred prior to five years, and ten recurred after five years. Patient characteristics that may have contributed to survival were examined. Procedures performed included five trisegmentectomies, 32 lobectomies, 16 left lateral segmentectomies, and 45 wedge resections. The margin of resection was recorded in 27 patients, one of whom had a positive margin, nine of whom had a less than or equal to 1-cm margin, and 17 of whom had a greater than 1-cm margin. Eighty-one patients had a solitary metastasis to the liver, 11 patients had two metastases, one patient had three metastases, and four patients had four metastases. Thirty patients had Stage C primary carcinoma, 40 had Stage B primary carcinoma, and one had Stage A primary carcinoma. The disease-free interval from the time of colon resection to the time of liver resection was less than one year in 65 patients, and greater than one year in 34 patients. Three patients had bilobar metastases. Four of the patients had extrahepatic disease resected simultaneously with the liver resection. Though several contraindications to hepatic resection have been proposed in the past, five-year survival has been found in patients with extrahepatic disease resected simultaneously, patients with bilobar metastases, patients with multiple metastases, and patients with positive margins. Five-year disease-free survivors are also present in each of these subsets. It is concluded that five-year survival is possible in the presence of reported contraindications to resection, and therefore that the decision to resect the liver must be individualized.\r"

One hundred seventy-nine patients underwent ileal reservoir and ileoanal anastomosis at the University of Toronto between December 1981 and January 1987. One hundred sixty-three patients had ulcerative colitis, 11 had familial adenomatous polyposis, and five had Crohn's disease. A J-reservoir was constructed in 72 patients and an S-reservoir in 107 patients. Functional results were assessed in 102 patients who had their loop ileostomies closed for more than one year. The most significant technical complications were anal anastomotic leaks (10 percent), reservoir anastomotic leaks (3.9 percent), anal anastomotic stricture (7.8 percent), late fistula-inano (2.8 percent), small-bowel obstruction (19 percent), and loop ileostomy complications (23 percent). Overweight males and patients with operative blood loss greater than 1000 cc developed anal stricture more frequently (P less than .005). Patients who had a stapled J-reservoir had a higher rate of reservoir leak. The average number of bowel movements reported by patients for 24 hours was 6.2 +/- 3.1. Only ten (9.8 percent) patients had to intubate their reservoir to empty it. Urgency was experienced by 24 patients and soilage at night by 23 (22.5 percent) and during the day by 18 (17.6 percent). Seven patients (6.8 percent) were incontinent during the night and only one during the day. Pouchitis was reported in 16 patients (15.7 percent). Patients with anal anastomotic stricture had more urgency and pouchitis, and had to intubate their reservoir more frequently (P less than .05). No other factors analyzed affected technical or functional results.\r"

Tumoricidal doses, however, are frequently associated with small-bowel damage. Animal experiments demonstrated tolerance to high-dose radiation therapy and protection from radiation enteritis by use of an absorbable polymer polyglycolic acid (PGA) that is used as an intestinal sling to elevate the small bowel away from the operated site. Sixty patients (42 with rectal carcinomas and 18 with gynecologic malignancies) underwent surgical treatment that included the intestinal sling procedure. Postoperative radiation was begun within three weeks following surgery and patients received a mean approximating 5500 rads in fractionated doses. A mean follow-up time of 28 months has not revealed a single case of radiation enteritis (by either contrast studies or physiologic studies) or PGA mesh-related complications. The authors believe that this surgical technique should be employed in patients who may require postoperative radiation treatment for pelvic malignancy.\r"

The technique includes removal of the involved crypt, closure of the internal opening with a sliding endorectal flap, and counter drainage of the fistula tract. This series includes eight patients treated over a five-year period with a follow-up of up to five years. This limited series had no complications and one case of early recurrence. Most of these patients had had previous failed attempts at correction of the fistula. The main advantage of this mode of treatment is preservation of the integrity of the sphincter muscle, thus avoiding the high risk of incontinence that is inherent especially with anteriorly located fistulas in females. It is proposed that, because it does not transect the sphincter anteriorly, this technique is safer than the placement of setons, as has been previously advised for management of anterior fistulas. The different treatment techniques for anal fistulas, including complications, recurrence rates, surgical techniques, and indications for types of management are reviewed.\r"

Although several factors (i.e., venous invasion) were of importance in univariate analysis, the following conclusions reflect the outcome and relative importance of the regression analysis only. Blood loss as an initial symptom and duration of symptoms were associated with a better prognosis. Location of the primary tumor, age, and sex did not appear to have prognostic value. Observations during operation such as palpable lymph nodes, fixity to adjacent organs, and tumor spill were related to a diminished tumor-free survival. Laboratory data (hemoglobin, leukocytes, ESR, GGTP, SGOT, SGPT, LDH, total protein, CEA) were tested for their potential prognostic values. Only a preoperative low protein level or an elevated CEA level were associated with an increased risk of death due to recurrent tumor. The histopathologic features (stage and grade), with the exception of venous invasion, were of relative importance in the determination of prognosis. The aforementioned variables can be included in a prognostic index on the base of which high-risk groups suitable for adjuvant studies can be identified.\r"

The results showed that empty iron stores are common in patients subjected to colon surgery; 40 percent of the patients had a total loss before the operation. Preoperatively empty iron stores were associated (P less than .01) with an increased risk of postoperative complications that were not explained by other nutritional parameters. Surgery of the colon did not affect serum ferritin concentration or iron stores acutely or long-term. Intake of dietary iron was determined by food recording for seven days in all patients and was compared to 40 controls. The preoperative hemorrhagia and lower daily intake of dietary iron (8 +/- 3 mg) in the patients than in the controls (14 +/- 4 mg) may explain the empty iron stores. However, patients with normal iron stores also had low amounts of dietary iron (9 +/- 3 mg). In 12 patients with empty iron stores the effects of ferrous sulfate (80 mg Fe++) three times daily for six weeks were studied. The patients responded well to the therapy. It is concluded that preoperatively empty iron stores are common in patients subjected to colon surgery, and that this raises the risk of postoperative complications. Colon operations are not followed by acute or long-term changes in serum ferritin concentration or iron stores. The restoration of iron is achieved by oral iron therapy.\r"

These angiographic findings were compared with both macroscopic and microscopic serosal cancer invasion. Angiographic diagnosis is in accord with the macroscopic findings in 84.2 percent of cases. Angiographic diagnosis is in accord with the microscopic findings in 32.4 percent of cases. Macroscopic findings confirm the angiographic diagnosis precisely but the conflict with microscopic findings should not be overlooked. This may be the result of inflammatory change, adhesion, and fibrosis around carcinoma of the colon.\r"

Forty mongrel dogs received preoperative radiation with 5000 rads and then underwent a low anterior resection and anastomosis using either the EEA-31TM stapling device, a two-layer handsewn technique, or the biofragmentable anastomotic ring (BAR) 31-1.5 mm and BAR 31-2.0 mm devices. The anastomoses were then evaluated for early and late anastomotic healing and leaks. The results show four radiographic (three clinical) leaks (P less than .05) in the BAR 31-1.5 mm group and one radiographic leak in the handsewn group. No leaks were detected in the EEA or BAR 31-2.0 mm groups. Results indicate that all three techniques can be done safely with this dose of radiation, and gap size (1.5 mm vs. 2.0 mm) is of critical importance when performing a BAR anastomosis in irradiated bowel.\r"

Hyperplastic polyps were more common in the rectum (71 percent) while adenomas were more common in the colon (63 percent). Hyperplastic polyps in the colon were associated with adenomas in 75 percent of cases and hyperplastic rectal polyps were associated with proximal adenomas in 63 percent. There were six mixed hyperplastic/adenomatous polyps. Of the 458 adenomas, 449 were tubular, eight were tubulovillous, and one was villous. Moderate dysplasia was noted in 23 (5 percent) and severe dysplasia in four (0.9 percent). There were associated large adenomas in 84 patients. Small colonic polyps are usually adenomatous and should be destroyed. Biopsy may be important if no other neoplasm has been identified. Small rectal polyps are usually hyperplastic but may be associated with proximal adenomas. Because of the uncertain significance of hyperplastic polyps they should also be treated, and are a relative indication for total colonoscopy.\r"

Intestinal blood flow rates were simultaneously measured in the left colon and rectum of six dogs by using labeled microspheres and expressed in function of the intraluminal pressure. Results show that for elevated values of intraluminal pressure, blood flow was significantly lower in the left colon than in the rectum.

Indications for creation of the ostomies included inflammatory bowel disease in six patients and carcinoma in three patients. The time from creation of the stoma to the first bleed was 11 to 196 months (mean, 82 months). The average time between this bleed and surgical treatment was six months. The operative procedures performed included nine mucocutaneous disconnections (MCD) in seven patients (one for recurrent bleeding) and two stoma relocations (one for recurrence). MCD is simple, quick, and associated with a lower morbidity and intraoperative blood loss than stomal relocation. Postoperative follow-up has ranged from 4 months to 4.6 years (mean, 2.5 years). During this period there were two episodes of recurrent varices that required surgery. In the select group of patients that cannot be managed conservatively, MCD is favored and relocation considered only if MCD is technically impossible.\r"

  ".W": "There are two muscular mechanisms of fecal continence. The anal sphincter squeezes the anal canal, thus lengthening it and increasing its resistance. The puborectalis kinks the distal rectum, preventing the transmission of intra-abdominal pressures into the anal canal. Balloon sphincterography simultaneously records the shape of the anal canal and distal rectum and measures the strength of the puborectalis and anal sphincter muscles. This allows the physician to evaluate the function of these important muscles in patients with symptomatic defecation disorders such as constipation, incontinence, and rectal prolapse. A cylindrical balloon is connected by a hose to a fluid reservoir filled with liquid barium. The deflated balloon is placed into the anal canal and inflated by raising the fluid reservoir in increments. Fluoroscopy visualizes the balloon's shape and video records the results. Quantitative sphincterogram measurements in patients with defecation disorders include (the three measurements in each category refer respectively to incontinent patients [N = 87], prolapse patients without incontinence [N = 26], and constipated patients [N = 65]); anorectal angle (degrees + S.D.): 114 + 28, 103 + 18, 95 + 19; anal canal length (mm + S.D.): 33 + 11, 38 + 10, 39 + 10; squeeze pressure (cm H2O + S.D.): 68 + 23, 80 + 16, 91 + 22, and opening pressure (cm H2O + S.D.): 52 + 25, 67 + 22, 81 + 24. The method is useful in identifying specific defects, such as paradoxic puborectalis contractions, that can cause constipation, and injuries to the sphincters that can cause incontinence. In over 280 patients with a wide variety of defecation disorders, sphincterography has yielded information not available by standard manometric techniques. It augments the findings of defecography.\r"

Liver metastases had significant elevated ODC levels over surrounding liver (0.271 vs. 0.065, respectively, P less than .008). Results similar to those found in liver metastases were noted in extrahepatic metastases (median value, 0.271). This study discusses the possible reasons for these elevations and emphasizes that these differences may have potential roles in the areas of diagnosis, staging, monitoring of the disease, and therapeutic interventions in colorectal cancer and its hepatic and extrahepatic metastases.\r"

Preoperative defecography revealed rectal intussusception in all patients. Postoperative control studies showed adequate rectal fixation to the anterior sacral surface. Intussusception no longer occurred. Rectal stenosis due to the surgical procedure was absent. The described technique of posterior rectopexy eliminates the prolapse mechanism without creating new disorders and is therefore a rational procedure. Advocation of new procedures should also be based on results of colorectal tests that assess the effect of the procedures on rectal function.\r"

Tumors were concentrated distally (rectum 6; sigmoid colon 5; proximal colon 11) and were diagnosed preoperatively in eight patients. Histologic grade and stage were as follows: grade I, 36 percent; II, 23 percent; III, 23 percent; IV, 18 percent; stage A, 5 percent; B1, 32 percent; B2, 18 percent; C1 and C2, 45 percent. Median hospital stay was 17 days with no operative mortality. Relaparotomy was required in 35 percent (sepsis in four patients; obstruction in two) and minor procedures were done in 12 percent (anastomotic dilatation in one; rectovaginal fistula in one). Mean frequency of defecation was 6.4/day, 1.0/night; incidence of minor seepage, 17 percent (day), 50 percent night); incidence of pouchitis, 8 percent; intermittent dyspareunia, 17 percent of six women. One patient died from hepatic metastases nine months after operation. IPAA should be considered in favorable cancers complicating CUC or FPC, although it may be contraindicated in advanced rectal cancer, and may be unsuitable in advanced proximal cancer.\r"

One group received ibuprofen, 12 mg/kg, preoperatively and postoperatively q6h for 24 hours; the second group served as a saline control. Propulsion was measured radiographically (q8h X 24h, then q12h) by following intraluminal radiopaque markers. Motility was measured with a multilumen monometric catheter on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 for a 3-hour period. Propulsion, as defined by movement of more than 80 percent of the markers to the rectum, averaged 46 hours in the saline animals vs. 40.8 hours in the ibuprofen animals for an average decrease of 13 percent (P = .42). Postoperative motility showed a significant increase in the ibuprofen-treated animals on the first postoperative day (26.8 percent, P = .043), most marked at the level of the ileum (48 percent, P = .005), with insignificant differences on the second and third days. Studies comparing ileum, proximal, and distal colon suggest that ileum and proximal colon may be the major site of ibuprofen effect (10.7 percent, P = .23 and 11.96 percent, P = .41 respectively). The data suggest that ibuprofen may have a beneficial effect on postoperative bowel motility but the clinical significance of this still needs to be determined.\r"

The authors report detailed cancer (all sites) family histories on two prototype families with Lynch syndrome I (Family R) and Lynch syndrome II (Family N), which have been under investigation for more than two decades. Emphasis is placed on shared clinicogenetic features; namely, early age of onset of colonic cancer (approximately age 44), multiple primary colonic cancer (24 percent of cases showed metachronous colonic cancer), predominance of proximal colonic cancer location (approximately 65 percent in the proximal colon), and vertical transmission consonant with an autosomal dominantly inherited factor. An increased predilection for extracolonic cancer, particularly endometrial carcinoma, occurs in Lynch syndrome II and is the primary basis for distinction from Lynch syndrome I. Surveillance and management programs must be wholly responsive to these natural history features.\r"

As a control, 11 resected specimens of ulcerative colitis without dysplastic changes and 26 specimens of colonic carcinoma were examined also. All dysplasia and carcinoma in ulcerative colitis stained blue, whereas normal colonic mucin stained red in 65 percent. In 14 of 20 specimens with carcinoma and/or dysplasia, the background mucosa appeared normal with hematoxylin and eosin staining, but showed a mosaic staining pattern with PAT/KOH/PAS. However, only two of 11 specimens of ulcerative colitis without dysplasia and none of 26 specimens of flat mucosa with colorectal carcinoma showed a mosaic staining pattern. From these observations it was concluded that the PAT/KOH/PAS staining method could be useful as a histochemical marker of premalignant change in longstanding ulcerative colitis.\r"

The degree of anticoagulation during chronic warfarin therapy of 33 patients was assessed before and after vaccination with trivalent types A and B influenza vaccine. Three patients were excluded because of inadequate PT data before vaccination and one patient was unavailable for follow-up after vaccination. Data from five additional patients were excluded from statistical analysis because the warfarin dose was changed within one week of vaccination. PT values obtained at zero to two weeks, three to four weeks, and two, three, and four months after vaccination were compared with each patient's prevaccination baseline value. PT values following vaccination were unchanged except for a decrease that occurred during the first two weeks (p less than 0.05). Complications did not require dosage adjustments and were limited to minor nose bleeds or bruises occurring in two patients before and three patients after vaccination. These data suggest a decrease rather than an increase in PT values following vaccination, and do not support the existence of a serious warfarin-vaccine interaction. The possibility that an occasional patient may experience such an interaction cannot be excluded, but none was seen in these patients.\r"

Levo-desoxyephedrine, also known as levo-methamphetamine, the main active ingredient in Vicks Inhalers, is known to have amphetamine-like properties. Stereotypic behavior is consistent with behavior that follows the use of amphetamine. Transvestism has traditionally been thought to be based on a psychodynamic model; however, the authors postulate several biochemical mechanisms whereby levo-desoxyephedrine may play a role in the bizarre behavior exhibited by this 32-year-old man. It is suggested that inhalers be placed in a new class of drugs that can be dispensed only by a pharmacist or physician.\r"

Bias was assessed by comparison of the median value of the prediction error with zero. The dosing recommendation based on the Cooper nomogram resulted in a significant positive bias (p less than or equal to 0.05). Intermethod accuracy was assessed by comparison of the absolute prediction errors of each dosing method. Significant differences in accuracy were observed between the method of Pepin when compared with the single-point method of Perry (p less than or equal to 0.05, k-sample sign test).

A questionnaire designed to assess the impact of a legislative bill permitting a pharmacist in an organized health care setting to initiate or modify drug therapy was mailed to state pharmacy associations, state hospital pharmacy associations, state pharmacy boards, state medical associations, Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA)-member manufacturers, and non-PMA-member generic manufacturers. Responses from 194 of the 307 invited organizations were used. The six organization types viewed the impact of the legislative bill differently (p less than 0.05). Hospital pharmacy associations and boards of pharmacy, to a lesser extent, supported the legislative bill; non-PMA-member generic manufacturers and state pharmacy associations were relatively neutral. The medical associations and the PMA-member companies opposed the passage of the bill. Furthermore, medical associations believed that the bill would not be passed in the majority of states in the next five years.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical pharmacists in this study hospital reported 1027 interventions in patient drug therapy over two time periods of three and two weeks, respectively. These interventions were subjected to self and peer reviews and to cost-avoidance evaluation. The most frequent type of intervention was recommendations related to drug selection (29.6 percent). Recommendations were not implemented by physicians in only 10.2 percent of the cases. The perceived impact of these interventions on the quality, cost, or both was found by the peer reviewers to occur in 58.5, 16.1 and 25.6 percent of the cases, respectively. Also, when peer reviewed for clinical significance, 983 of these interventions were judged to improve drug therapy to an acceptable level based on the professional literature, and 36 were deemed very significant in terms of saving patients' lives or preserving major organ functions. Of the 983 interventions rendering drug therapy to an appropriate level, 398 were deemed to have cost-avoidance impact; of this number a 25 percent random sample was subjected to cost-avoidance evaluation. Realized cost-avoidance averaged $242 for each intervention implemented. When extrapolated annually, $364,900 was the net realized cost-avoidance after discounting for the cost of providing clinical pharmacy services. An average cost-avoidance of $860.50 was calculated for each intervention made by pharmacists, but not followed by physicians, for an annual potential cost-avoidance of $532,650. In all, clinical pharmacists had the potential to save $897,550 annually in hospital resources if all their interventions had been accepted and implemented.\r"

Cross-linked bovine dermal collagen was injected beneath the mucosa in the area of the lower esophageal sphincter through a 23 gauge needle-tipped catheter. A mean volume of 85 ml of implant was injected in 0.5- to 4-ml increments over 3 to 10 injection sessions. All patients developed objective evidence of decreased reflux by one or more parameters. Nine out of 10 patients had decreased symptoms, and 8 of 9 patients had an increase in lower esophageal pressure after implant injection. Endoscopic implant treatment resulted in statistically significant improvement in symptom scores (p less than 0.001), the standard acid reflux test (p = 0.009), and lower esophageal sphincter pressures (p = 0.002), but not in the endoscopic appearance of the esophagus (p = 0.131). Subjective and objective improvements in reflux parameters generally lasted 6 to 9 months with return toward pretreatment status by 12 months. Antibodies to bovine collagen developed in 5 of 10 subjects with no clinical sequelae and no apparent reactivity with human collagen. The technique is not difficult to perform and is well tolerated by patients, and the results indicate the potential for more general use with a more suitable implant material.\r"

Forty-six percent of the patients were younger than 65 years, and 13% were in the age group above 79 years. Initial complaints and final endoscopic diagnosis were related to sex and age. Statistically significant age-related differences in outcome diagnosis were found for gastritis in younger men (p less than 0.01) and negative examinations in younger women (p less than 0.01). Duodenitis (p less than 0.05) and duodenal ulcer disease (p less than 0.05) occurred more frequently in men, whereas hiatal hernia was more frequent in women (p less than 0.05). Older people presented with a more nonspecific pattern of complaints and symptoms, but, nevertheless, a good correlation was observed between complaints and endoscopic abnormalities in the elderly compared with a younger group. Since esophagogastroduodenoscopy was well tolerated and did not provoke a higher incidence of complications in the elderly, it was concluded that endoscopic evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract is a safe and effective examination for the investigation of upper abdominal complaints in a geriatric patient population.\r"

Initial technical success (94%) and initial improvement of symptoms (81%) were comparable to data reported previously. Complications were bleeding (6%), sepsis (6%), and tracheoesophageal fistula (6%). This analysis, however, addressed the impact of ELT on the remaining life of the patients. In 9 patients (29%) ELT was the only palliative alternative, and in 7 of these patients a fair functional success was achieved. In 13/21 (63%) of the patients with good initial functional result palliation could be preserved by repeated ELT until death from cachexia. Eight patients, however, were intubated in the follow-up period because of failure to keep the esophagus open. The dysphagia-free interval was only 4 weeks, and repeated ELT became progressively more difficult because of increased tumor load and increasing debility of the patient. 32% of the patients experienced ELT as more difficult than repeated dilations. Our data also suggest that duration of palliation after ELT alone lasts longer than palliation after dilation followed by ELT. Results of ELT were best in patients with recurrent cancer at the esophagogastric or esophagojejunal anastomosis.\r"

In type II and III malignant strictures of the bifurcation of the common hepatic duct and the main hepatic duct, use of two or more stents to achieve complete drainage of the biliary system improves survival compared to incomplete drainage (176 vs. 119 days) and reduces procedure-related mortality and the incidence of early and late cholangitis. Patients with hilar tumors causing type II and III strictures treated with placement of multiple stents have at least as good a prognosis as patients with tumor involving only the common hepatic duct treated with use of a single stent. Once ERCP is performed and palliative endoscopic management of bifurcation tumors is begun, it must completed as soon as possible.\r"

Inappropriate verbal, vocal, or motor activity often results in problem behavior that burdens caregivers or nursing home staff. A careful differential diagnostic approach to agitated behavior is imperative to avoid misdiagnosis. The misuse of psychoactive drugs often begins with an unclear idea of the underlying pathophysiology. Treatment should be combined with an explicit establishment of therapeutic goals and a precise understanding of the pharmacological profiles of commonly used drugs.\r"

Normotensive animals kept under identical conditions served as controls. Mean arterial blood pressure rose from 83 to 155 mm Hg in the hypertensive group of longest duration, but the ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight was not different between the experimental and control groups. Although left ventricular hypertrophy was not present, left ventricular peak systolic pressure of perfused hearts was significantly higher in hypertensive than in normotensive hearts. Furthermore, while in hypertensive hearts the left ventricular end-diastolic volume was increased, the peak systolic pressure did not respond to an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume. Functional changes were accompanied by metabolic changes in the left ventricle. Rates of glucose utilization were increased and rates of ketone body utilization were decreased in hypertensive hearts. Activities of key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism (phosphorylase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase) were increased, while those of ketone body metabolism (3-oxoacid-CoA transferase, acetoacetyl-CoA synthase) were decreased and those of the citric acid cycle (citrate synthase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase) were not different between groups. In summary, moderate hypertension for a period of more than 1 year resulted in functional and metabolic changes of the left ventricle in hypertensive animals that were already manifest at 8 weeks of hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To identify genetic factors linked obligatorily to hypertension in the rat, pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were compared with genetically similar (Wistar-Kyoto rats; WKY) and different (Sprague-Dawley) normotensive strains. The only variables that distinguished SHR from both WKY and Sprague-Dawley rats were a greater maximum pressor response to electrical stimulation of sympathetic outflow and decreased sensitivity to submaximal doses of the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine (i.e., higher ED50). SHR had in common with Sprague-Dawley rats basal blood pressure after pithing plus adrenalectomy and the maximum pressor response to methoxamine; both these values were higher than those in WKY. All strains demonstrated equal sensitivity of the vasoconstrictor response to endogenous norepinephrine released by electrical simulation at submaximal frequency, even though sensitivity to the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist was lower in SHR. The alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist rauwolscine attenuated the pressor response to electrical stimulation in SHR and WKY but increased it in Sprague-Dawley rats. The alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin attenuated the response more in SHR and WKY than in Sprague-Dawley rats. We conclude that 1) sympathetic hyperactivity is linked obligatorily to hypertension in SHR; 2) increased basal blood pressure and noradrenergic vasoconstrictor response are present in SHR, but they are not obligatorily linked to hypertension; 3) feedback inhibition of norepinephrine release is comparable in SHR or WKY and poorly developed compared with that in Sprague-Dawley rats; 4) decreased sensitivity of the pressor response to stimulation of vascular alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in SHR compensates partially for increased sympathetic activity or hyperinnervation, or both.\r"

Vessels were preconstricted using concentrations of norepinephrine or 5-hydroxytryptamine, which reduced their diameters by 50 to 60%. Relaxation responses to acetylcholine (10(-8) - 10(-7) M) were significantly smaller (p less than 0.05) in vessel segments from SHRSP, but the maximal relaxations at higher concentrations were the same in both strains. However, SHRSP vessels relaxed to a greater extent than did those of the WKY at all concentrations of sodium nitroprusside. Endothelium removal significantly enhanced sodium nitroprusside-induced dilations in both rat strains, and the dilations were significantly greater in segments from SHRSP in the concentration range of 3 X 10(-8) to 10(-6) M. The decreased relaxation to acetylcholine in resistance arteries from adult hypertensive rats compared with those from the normotensive strain suggests that functional alterations in the endothelium may play a role in hypertensive disease.\r"

In these experiments we intravenously infused 6-iodamiloride (0.38 mg/100 g body weight) over a 10- to 11-minute period into rats with reduced renal mass-saline hypertension or one-kidney, one clip hypertension. The infusion produced a prompt but transient fall in blood pressure. These findings are in contrast to those in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), in which the same infusion of 6-iodoamiloride produced a prompt, pronounced, and sustained fall in blood pressure. Studies from a number of laboratories suggest that vascular smooth muscle cells from the SHR have increased permeability to sodium whereas vascular smooth muscle cells from the other two models do not. Thus, 6-iodoamiloride may have potential both as a diagnostic probe and a therapeutic agent for hypertension characterized by increased vascular smooth muscle cell permeability to sodium.\r"

Nifedipine monotherapy effectively lowered blood pressure in 73% of the patients. Glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow were increased 13.3 and 19.6%, respectively. The filtration fraction and urinary albumin excretion remained unchanged. Renal vascular resistance was markedly reduced (25.2%). Changes observed in renal function were independent of the patients' initial glomerular filtration rate. Furthermore, there was no correlation between the systemic and renal effects of nifedipine monotherapy. Patients with a poor systemic blood pressure response exhibited increases in both glomerular filtration rate (+13%) and effective renal plasma flow (+20%), changes comparable with increases in glomerular filtration rate (+13%) and effective renal plasma flow (+19%) observed in patients achieving a goal blood pressure response (diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg, or a greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure, or both). These results suggest that nifedipine monotherapy has the potential to improve renal function abnormalities encountered in the essential hypertensive state independently of its effect on systemic blood pressure.\r"

The ratio of peak systolic pressure to end-systolic dimension was used to assess left ventricular performance and was divided for either posterior wall thickness or cross-sectional area to generate hypertrophy-independent indices of inotropic state. Fractional shortening was normal in the hypertensive group, despite the increase in end-systolic stress. Systolic pressure/dimension ratio was higher in hypertensive subjects (p less than 0.001), as were hypertrophy-independent indices of inotropic state (p less than 0.005), which were inversely correlated to left ventricular mass (p less than 0.001). Values in 11 hypertensive subjects were above the upper confidence limit of the normal shortening/stress relation, which provides a load-independent measure of inotropic state. They showed high hypertrophy-independent indices of inotropic state (p less than 0.01), while the other hypertensive subjects did not. High fractional shortening, wall stress, and systolic pressure (p less than 0.01) were found in the subgroup with supernormal performance, while left ventricular mass was not different from that of other subgroups, depicting inadequate left ventricular hypertrophy. The duration of hypertension was the same in the subgroups. Supernormal inotropic state could be considered one form of primary adaptation to high wall stress that serves to maintain systolic ventricular performance.\r"

Sixty-one percent of patients failed to increase their ejection fraction by 5% on exercise; the mean daytime systolic pressure (168 +/- 15 mm Hg) was lower in this group than in those who had a normal exercise response (188 +/- 17 mm Hg; p less than 0.005). Thirty percent of patients had left ventricular hypertrophy based on electrocardiographic criteria; this group had a higher mean blood pressure (189 +/- 20 mm Hg) than the remainder (170 +/- 15 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). A closer correlation was demonstrated between blood pressure and ejection fraction response to exercise in the group with left ventricular hypertrophy (r = 0.8) than in the group without hypertrophy (r = 0.3). These results failed to demonstrate a linear relationship between blood pressure and ejection fraction. However, a relationship between the height of blood pressure and the development of left ventricular hypertrophy was shown, and myocardial response to exercise was increased in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy.\r"

However, it is unknown whether platelets take up and store catecholamines during physiological in vivo increments in plasma catecholamines. Previously untreated 50-year-old men (n = 17) with mild to moderate essential hypertension were given a low sodium diet for 2 weeks. Urinary excretion of sodium decreased from 201 +/- 11 (SE) to 24 +/- 5 and 19 +/- 4 mmol/24 hr after 1 and 2 weeks, respectively. During the first week, the blood platelet concentration of norepinephrine increased from 27.2 +/- 2.9 to 39.6 +/- 4.7 pg/mg (p less than 0.005) and venous plasma norepinephrine increased from 3.7 +/- 0.4 to 5.6 +/- 0.5 pg/ml (p less than 0.005), and venous plasma dopamine increased from 26 +/- 4 to 41 +/- 5 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). During the second week, both plasma and platelet norepinephrine and dopamine remained elevated. Platelet epinephrine showed a small increase from baseline to the second week (p less than 0.05), but no concomitant increase in plasma epinephrine occurred. Thus, sodium depletion increases both platelet and plasma catecholamines and blood platelets may take up catecholamines in vivo. Platelet catecholamine content may be an integrated measure of plasma catecholamine concentrations during variations caused by sodium depletion.\r"

Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid CK-BB is most reliable when it is done within 48 to 72 hours of the arrest. The appearance of serum CK-BB after a cardiac arrest indicates global ischemia, but has not been shown to be a reliable indicator for outcome, because of its rapid inactivation in the body.

Pain was assessed according to a modified visual analogue scale graded from 0 to 10, where 0 meant no pain and 10 meant the most severe pain. Patients generally scored their maximal pain before admission higher than their pain in the CCU. The maximal pain before admission did not seem to differ between patients with larger and smaller infarcts, estimated from maximal serum enzyme activity, whereas patients with larger infarcts tended to have more intensive pain in the hospital despite consuming more analgesics during the first 3 hours and the first 24 hours in the CCU. The time between onset of symptoms and decision to go to the hospital was not influenced by the intensity of pain before admission, but patients with larger infarcts made their decision much faster than those with smaller infarcts. In conclusion, infarct size, a major determinant of the initial prognosis, appeared to influence the initial pain course in the CCU and to markedly affect the delay time between onset of symptoms and the decision to seek medical care.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we compared two types of communication techniques (planned and unplanned) for effectiveness in communication in the early postoperative intubation period with patients who had cardiac surgery. In this quasi-experimental study we used a sample of 40 patients undergoing open heart surgery who participated in preoperative teaching. The control group (n = 20) relied on the experience and creativity of the nurse to provide a method of postoperative communication. The experimental group (n = 20) was introduced to a communication board before surgery and used the board during the postoperative intubation period. Each patient completed an open-ended patient interview, a patient satisfaction questionnaire, and a visual analogue scale to assess satisfaction with communication after discharge from the intensive care unit. An independent t test indicated that a planned method of communication does significantly increase patient satisfaction in the early postoperative intubation period (t = 2.09, p = 0.05, n = 35). Content analyses of the patient interviews further supported this finding. Validity of the patient satisfaction questionnaire was supported by a high correlation (r = 0.70) with results from the visual analogue scale. Nurse satisfaction with communication during intubation was analyzed by use of a nurse satisfaction questionnaire and open-ended questions that were completed by the nurse after caring for the patients in this study. A dependent t test (t = 1.25, not significant, n = 20) and content analysis indicated that planned communication did not increase nurse satisfaction; however, it did add to the repertoire of methods that nurses currently use in trying to communicate with their patients.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of respiratory control system loop gain on periodic breathing during sleep, 10 volunteers were studied during stage 1-2 non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep while breathing room air (room air control), while hypoxic (hypoxia control), and while wearing a tight-fitting mask that augmented control system gain by mechanically increasing the effect of ventilation on arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) (hypoxia increased gain). Ventilatory responses to progressive hypoxia at two steady-state end-tidal PCO2 levels and to progressive hypercapnia at two levels of oxygenation were measured during wakefulness as indexes of controller gain. Under increased gain conditions, five male subjects developed periodic breathing with recurrent cycles of hyperventilation and apnea; the remaining subjects had nonperiodic patterns of hyperventilation. Periodic breathers had greater ventilatory response slopes to hypercapnia under either hyperoxic or hypoxic conditions than nonperiodic breathers (2.98 +/- 0.72 vs. 1.50 +/- 0.39 l.min-1.Torr-1; 4.39 +/- 2.05 vs. 1.72 +/- 0.86 l.min-1.Torr-1; for both, P less than 0.04) and greater ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia at a PCO2 of 46.5 Torr (2.07 +/- 0.91 vs. 0.87 +/- 0.38 l.min-1.% fall in SaO2(-1); P less than 0.04). To assess whether spontaneous oscillations in ventilation contributed to periodic breathing, power spectrum analysis was used to detect significant cyclic patterns in ventilation during NREM sleep. Oscillations occurred more frequently in periodic breathers, and hypercapnic responses were higher in subjects with oscillations than those without. The results suggest that spontaneous oscillations in ventilation are common during sleep and can be converted to periodic breathing with apnea when loop gain is increased.\r"

Ventilated rabbits demonstrated changes in resistance and compliance similar to spontaneously breathing rabbits. Chlorpheniramine pretreatment prevented increases in resistance but not decreases in compliance. Anaphylaxis constricted small (less than 1 mm) airways 20.9 +/- 16.0% (mean +/- SD) and intermediate (between 1 and 3 mm) airways 21.8 +/- 19.8%. Chlorpheniramine (10 mg/kg) prevented small airway changes and attenuated those in intermediate airways. Chlorpheniramine prevented histamine-induced constriction of small (23.6 +/- 15.7%) and intermediate (17.6 +/- 15.0%) airways. Lung wet-to-dry wt ratios were unchanged. Changes in resistance and compliance during rabbit IgE anaphylaxis are not due to changes in tidal volume or frequency. Histamine, via H1 receptors, is the principal mediator of pulmonary resistance increases but not dynamic compliance reductions. Chlorpheniramine-sensitive increases in resistance are caused by constrictions of intermediate and small airways, whereas the chlorpheniramine-resistant decrease in compliance is not caused directly by constriction of the smallest measurable airways (0.25 mm) or changes in lung water.\r"

Since peak O2 uptake (peak VO2) and muscle strength may be related to leg compliance, we examined the relationships between leg compliance and factors related to muscle size and physical fitness. Ten healthy men, 25-52 yr, underwent tests for determination of vascular compliance of the calf (Whitney mercury strain gauge), peak VO2 (Bruce treadmill), calf muscle strength (Cybex isokinetic dynamometer), body composition (densitometry), and anthropometric measurements of the calf. Cross-sectional areas (CSA) of muscle, fat, and bone in the calf were determined by computed tomography scans. Leg compliance was not significantly correlated with any variables associated with physical fitness per se (peak VO2, calf strength, age, body weight, or composition). Leg compliance correlated with calf CSA (r = -0.72, P less than 0.02) and calculated calf volume (r = -0.67, P less than 0.03). The most dominant contributing factor to the determination of leg compliance was CSA of calf muscle (r = -0.60, P less than 0.06), whereas fat and bone were poor predictors (r = -0.11 and 0.07, respectively). We suggest that leg compliance is less when there is a large muscle mass providing structural support to limit expansion of the veins. This relationship is independent of aerobic and/or strength fitness level of the individual.\r"

They were evaluated before the program and after 6 and 12 wk of training. Weekly measurements of 1 RM showed a progressive increase in strength in extensors and flexors. By 12 wk extensor and flexor strength had increased 107.4 (P less than 0.0001) and 226.7% (P less than 0.0001), respectively. Isokinetic peak torque of extensors and flexors measured on a Cybex II dynamometer increased 10.0 and 18.5% (P less than 0.05) at 60 degrees/s and 16.7 and 14.7% (P less than 0.05) at 240 degrees/s. The torque-velocity relationship showed an upward displacement of the curve at the end of training, mainly in the slow-velocity high-torque region. Midthigh composition from computerized tomographic scans showed an increase (P less than 0.01) in total thigh area (4.8%), total muscle area (11.4%), and quadriceps area (9.3%). Biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle revealed similar increases (P less than 0.001) in type I fiber area (33.5%) and type II fiber area (27.6%). Daily excretion of urinary 3-methyl-L-histidine increased with training (P less than 0.05) by an average 40.8%. Strength gains in older men were associated with significant muscle hypertrophy and an increase in myofibrillar protein turnover.\r"

There is a significant positive correlation between tracheal area and vital capacity in males only (r = 0.36, P less than 0.01). These results support the concept of dysanapsis, relatively independent growth of the airways and lung parenchyma, as well as sex-related differences in airway size and growth. Inherent airway size may be a factor in the development and/or progression of lung disease.\r"

To examine the hypothesis that changes in brain stem extracellular fluid (ECF) pH explain this transient ventilatory response, we measured brain stem ECF pH and respiratory drive during hypoxia in newborn pigs. The animals were anesthetized with alpha-chloralose-urethan, paralyzed, vagotomized, and mechanically ventilated with a servo-controlled ventilator to regulate end-tidal CO2. Hypoxic ventilation for 6 min was achieved by changing inspired gas from 100% to 10-15% O2. Respiration, measured as integrated phrenic nerve activity, showed a range of responses. In 13 trials increased phrenic activity early in the hypoxic period was sustained or further augmented for the duration of the period. In contrast, in eight other trials phrenic activity increased and then declined. Regardless of the respiratory response, ECF pH (measured with a flat-surface electrode) increased slightly (0.009 +/- 0.002 U) during the first 2.5 min of hypoxia and then declined 0.061 +/- 0.017 U by the 6th min. This acidotic shift in ECF pH is inconsistent with the hypothesis that an alkalotic shift causes the nonsustained respiratory response of newborn pigs.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the mechanical effects of the abdominal and triangularis sterni expiratory recruitment that occurs when anesthetized dogs are tilted head up, we measured both before and after cervical vagotomy the end-expiratory length of the costal and crural diaphragmatic segments and the end-expiratory lung volume (FRC) in eight spontaneously breathing animals during postural changes from supine (0 degree) to 80 degrees head up. Tilting the animals from 0 degree to 80 degrees head up in both conditions was associated with a gradual decrease in end-expiratory costal and crural diaphragmatic length and with a progressive increase in FRC. All these changes, however, were considerably larger (P less than 0.005 or less) postvagotomy when the expiratory muscles were no longer recruited with tilting. Alterations in the elastic properties of the lung could not account for the effects of vagotomy on the postural changes. We conclude therefore that 1) by contracting during expiration, the canine expiratory muscles minimize the shortening of the diaphragm and the increase in FRC that the action of gravity would otherwise introduce, and 2) the end-expiratory diaphragmatic length and FRC in upright dogs are thus actively determined. The present data also indicate that by relaxing at end expiration, the expiratory muscles make a substantial contribution to tidal volume in upright dogs; in the 80 degrees head-up posture, this contribution would amount to approximately 60% of tidal volume.\r"

Cold exposure did not influence core temperature. On the other hand, cooling the heat exchanger caused a fall in core temperature of approximately 0.7 degree C, to 37 degrees C in normothermia and to 38.5 degrees C 24 h after the infection. These lower core temperatures were then regulated against any further increase in heat loss until the thermoregulatory metabolic capacity of the animals was exhausted and a hypothermia developed. It is concluded that in infectious fever the threshold temperature of shivering increases as much as core temperature. Furthermore it is suggested that physical antipyresis, such as sponging with tepid water, induces a moderate but regulated fall in temperature to about the threshold of shivering and that its efficacy may increase with ambient temperature.\r"

  ".W": "Fluid leaking from arterial and venous extra-alveolar vessels (EAV's) may account for up to 60% of the total transvascular fluid flux when edema occurs in the setting of normal vascular permeability. We determined if the permeability and relative contribution of EAV's was altered after inducing acute lung injury in rabbits by administering oleic acid (0.1 ml/kg) into the pulmonary artery, HCl (5 ml/kg of 0.1 N) into the trachea, or air emboli (0.03 ml.kg-1.min-1) into the right atrium for 90 min. Subsequently, the lungs were excised and continuously weighed while they were maintained in a warmed, humidified chamber with alveolar and pulmonary vascular pressures controlled and the lungs either ventilated or distended with 5% CO2 in air. The vascular system was filled with autologous blood and saline (1:1) to which papaverine (0.1 mg/ml) was added to inhibit vasospasm. Vascular pressures were referenced to the lung base. After a transient hydrostatic stress to maximize recruitment, vascular pressures were set at 5 cmH2O, and lungs were allowed to become isogravimetric (30-60 min). A fluid filtration coefficient (Kf) was determined by the use of a modification of the method of Drake and colleagues [Am. J. Physiol. 234 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 3): H266-H274, 1978]. EAV's were isolated by zoning techniques. In control preparations arterial and venous EAV's accounted for 26% (n = 9) and 38% (n = 11) of the total leakage, respectively. In all three models Kf increased two- to fourfold when the lungs were in zone 3 (alveolar vessels and arterial and venous EAV's contributing to the leakage).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The adequacy of nerve stimulation was checked by recording simultaneously the electrical response of a nonfatiguing muscle, the abductor of the small finger. The decrease in force and in the natural electrical activity with fatigue was accompanied by a parallel decrease in the amplitude of synchronous muscle action potentials (M waves) evoked by artificial stimulation of the ulnar nerve at different frequencies. The decline in M-wave amplitude in the adductor pollicis was not due to a submaximal nerve stimulation, since the amplitudes recorded simultaneously from the nonfatiguing abductor digiti minimi remained unchanged. The force and the electrical responses from the adductor pollicis recovered in parallel with a half time of approximately 1 min. These results suggest that the loss of force of the adductor pollicis with fatigue and its subsequent recovery are largely determined by the extent of neuromuscular propagation failure. The slow recovery of the M-wave amplitude during repetitive stimulation suggests that it may be related to some aspect of muscle metabolism.\r"

Experimental obesity was associated with an increased body fat and cardiac muscle mass, yet a normotensive systemic arterial pressure. Aortic ligation produced an elevated mean arterial pressure and resting heart rate, whereas body weight was similar to that of normotensive lean control rats. Obesity and hypertension together were associated with a significantly increased percent body fat, mean arterial pressure, and left ventricular mass compared with lean controls, whereas pressure and left ventricular weight were greater than those observed in rats with only obesity or hypertension. Cardiac adaptations corrected for body weight indicated that left ventricular weight increased as a function of body weight and body fat, but hypertension produced left ventricular adaptations independent of these variables. These initial studies indicate an additional contribution of hypertension to the left ventricular adaptations of obesity, and this model could therefore be used in future investigations concerning the cardiovascular effects of the simultaneous occurrence of these separate diseases.\r"

Female rats received a single subcutaneous injection of cortisol acetate (CA) (100 mg.kg body wt-1) 21 h before treadmill running (30.8 m/min). At the start of exercise in the CA-treated rats, plasma fatty acids and liver glycogen were increased by 40%. Glycogen levels were also increased by CA treatment in slow-twitch soleus (61%), fast-twitch white vastus (38%), and fast-twitch red vastus lateralis (85%) muscles. Exercise time to exhaustion was increased by CA treatment (114 +/- 5 vs. 95 +/- 6 min, P less than 0.05). During the exercise, total glycogen depletion was greater in the CA-treated than in the control animals, whereas estimated relative rates of carbohydrate utilization (R = 0.90) were similar. However, while running the CA-treated group consumed 11% more O2 than the controls (P less than 0.05). These results show that a single injection of glucocorticoids is capable of improving endurance. Yet the increased O2 uptake during exercise may have minimized the impact of the initial increased availability of carbohydrates and fatty acids in prolonging exercise capacity. This decreased running economy by the CA-treated runners may be secondary to alterations in energy production or utilization.\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen sheep previously prepared for chronic study were divided into three groups of six animals each. These were given graded inhalation injury utilizing smoke obtained from burning cotton-toweling material. Smoke was insufflated into animals with a modified bee smoker at temperatures less than 40 degrees C. Group H, which received 64 breaths of smoke, showed the most pronounced changes in pulmonary function. The changes consisted mainly of a profound increase in lung lymph flow following a reduced P/F ratio (PO2 in arterial blood/inspired O2 fraction) and an elevation in both thermal and gravimetrically measured extravascular lung water. Similar changes were seen in group M (48 breaths of smoke) and group L (32 breaths of smoke). However, the injury was graded based on the changes in gravimetrically measured lung water and lung lymph flow. These were highest in group H and lowest in group L. These studies confirm our ability to accurately quantitate the injury induced by smoke inhalation. In addition, it demonstrates that lung injury associated with the inhalation of smoke can be graded depending on the duration of exposure.\r"

Twitch contraction time in the triceps surae complex was 20% longer in strength-trained and sedentary groups than in endurance-trained or active control groups. In the 15 subjects peak twitch torque and one-half relation time in the triceps surae were 22.6 +/- 7.9 N.m and 91.1 +/- 18.3 ms, respectively. Mean fiber area in the gastrocnemius was approximately 1.6-, 1.7-, and 2.5-fold greater in the active control, endurance-trained, and strength-trained groups, respectively, relative to the sedentary group. Despite these large differences in fiber areas, the fiber fractional volume of the sarcoplasmic reticulum-transverse tubule network averaged 3.38 +/- 0.86% and 5.50 +/- 0.94% in type I and type II fibers, respectively, in all subjects. The fractional fiber volume of cytoplasm and lipid were similar for all four groups. However, mitochondrial volume was approximately 30% lower in both fiber types of the strength-trained group relative to the other groups. This implies that with exercise-induced hypertrophy, the sarcoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm, and lipid components increase proportionately with contractile protein, whereas the mitochondrial fraction does not. The proportion of type I fibers in the soleus, medial gastrocnemius, and lateral gastrocnemius was 75.2 +/- 8.3, 58.5 +/- 6.1, and 52.4 +/- 4.2%, respectively, and was similar in all subject groups. The results demonstrate that twitch duration is prolonged in strength-trained athletes relative to endurance athletes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In high-pressure pulmonary edema, lung interstitial and air space edema liquids have equal protein concentrations (Am. J. Physiol. 231: 1466, 1976). This suggests that the alveolar-airway barrier separating the air and interstitial spaces is relatively unrestrictive, even without apparent epithelial injury. To estimate the equivalent pore population of the alveolar-airway barrier we inflated each of 18 isolated dog lung lobes for 1 h with a solution of colored tracer of uniform radius. Tracer radii ranged from 1.3 to 405 nm. After freezing the lobes in liquid N2, we measured interstitial tracer concentrations in frozen perivascular cuffs or in samples thawed after dissection from frozen cuffs. Relative to the concentrations instilled, interstitial concentrations ranged from 0.34 for the smallest particles (1.3 and 3.5 nm radius) to zero for particles with radii of 405 nm. From the results we designed a pore model of the alveolar-airway barrier to reproduce the concentrations we measured. No single-pore model could be obtained, although a three-pore model fit the data well. The model results predict that pores with radii of 1, 40, and 400 nm would account for 68, 30, and 2% of total liquid flux, respectively. The majority of liquid flux (68%) would occur through passageways smaller than the smallest tracer we used (1.3 nm radius). We believe the alveolar-airway barrier consists not only of tight intercellular junctions that allow passage of only water and electrolytes but also of a smaller number of large leaks that allow passage of particles up to nearly 400 nm in radius.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of liposomes on the pulmonary circulation of sheep and found a close correlation between liposome retention in the lung and the intravascular macrophages. A test dose of liposomes (5.5 mumol of total lipids) injected intravenously transiently increased pulmonary arterial pressure from 24 +/- 2 to 55 +/- 16 (SD) cmH2O. The pulmonary arterial pressure responses were dose dependent and reproducible. The rise in pulmonary arterial pressure was blocked completely by indomethacin and 75% by a thromboxane synthase inhibitor. Systemic arterial thromboxane B2 concentration increased from a base-line level of less than 50 pg/ml to 250 +/- 130 pg/ml at the peak of the pressor response. Larger doses of liposomes (220 mumol of total lipids) infused intravenously over 1 h increased pulmonary arterial pressure maximally within the first 15 min. Lymph flow increased and lymph protein concentration decreased, suggesting venoconstriction. Over half (62.4 +/- 15.7%) of 111In-labeled liposomes remained in the lung after 2 h. Fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy showed that greater than 90% of the liposomes were associated with mononuclear cells in the lumen of the alveolar wall microvessels. We conclude that liposomes affect pulmonary arterial pressure transiently by a mechanism involving the arachidonate cascade, principally thromboxane. Our observations suggest that a population of pulmonary intravascular macrophages is likely to be the source of the thromboxane and the pulmonary hemodynamic and lymph dynamic changes that occur in a dose-dependent fashion, although interactions between liposomes, leukocytes, or endothelial cells, in addition to the macrophages, have not been completely ruled out. We believe this is the first demonstration that pulmonary intravascular macrophages may be the source of the arachidonate metabolites rather than endothelial cells, neutrophils, or perivascular interstitial cells.\r"

During this test, a decrement in the endurance capacity of the MI rat was demonstrated as the SHAM rat swam 25% longer than the MI rat (65 +/- 4 vs. 52 +/- 4 min). Glycogen concentrations were measured in the liver and the white gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus muscles of SHAM and MI rats that were randomly divided into four subgroups, which consisted of resting control, swim to exhaustion, swim to exhaustion + 24 h recovery, and swim to exhaustion + 24 h recovery + a second swim to exhaustion. The results demonstrated that the glycogen concentrations found in the liver, white gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus muscles of the SHAM and MI rats belonging to the resting control groups were similar. After swimming to exhaustion the glycogen concentrations in these tissues were significantly reduced compared with those found in the resting control groups of rats, and after 24 h of recovery the glycogen concentrations in these tissues were again similar to those found in the resting control groups of rats. Since the magnitude of the glycogen depletion in the liver and the white gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus muscles was similar in the SHAM and MI rats and because the SHAM rats consistently swam for longer periods of time in each of the experimental groups, it would be logical to assume that the rates of glycogen utilization for the various tissues may have been greater in the MI rat during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At 7 mo of age we used microspheres to evaluate myocardial perfusion in conscious rats. Exercise training did not alter hypertension or left ventricular hypertrophy but did increase maximal O2 consumption in both SHR and WKY. A decrement in left and right ventricular coronary reserve in SHR, compared with WKY, was indicated by 1) a smaller increment in myocardial perfusion during maximal vasodilation with dipyridamole and 2) a higher minimal coronary vascular resistance per unit mass. Exercise training had no significant effect on any index of myocardial perfusion in SHR or WKY. A 12% decrement in capillary numerical density in the endomyocardium of SHR was not reversed by exercise training. We estimated the volume densities of mitochondria, myofibrils, and sarcoplasm using electron microscopy and point-counting stereology on perfusion-fixed hearts. None of the parameters in either SHR or WKY was changed by exercise training. It is concluded that exercise training does not reverse the decrements in coronary reserve and capillary numerical density associated with hypertension in adult rats. Moreover the previously observed enhancement of mitochondrial volume density due to exercise in young hypertensive rats was not observed in adult SHR.\r"

  ".W": "When confluent calf pulmonary arterial endothelial monolayers cultured on polycarbonate micropore membranes were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2) for 3 days, endothelial cells became enlarged, and their permeability to 125I-labeled albumin was markedly increased. Similar changes were not observed when endothelial monolayers were exposed to hyperoxia for 1 or 2 days. Cell counting and acridine orange staining of endothelial monolayers revealed that the hyperoxia-induced increase in albumin permeability was not associated with a denuding injury or loss of cells from the monolayers. Vimentin filament staining of O2-exposed monolayers showed thickening of the perinuclear vimentin coil in some cells. Rhodamine-phalloidin staining demonstrated that hyperoxia caused a progressive alteration in the actin distribution. Two days after O2 exposure, peripheral actin bands became thinner, whereas the number of cytoplasmic stress fibers was increased. Three days after O2 exposure, peripheral actin bands of most cells were disrupted or absent. Because peripheral actin bands play an important role in maintaining the integrity of endothelial monolayers, disruption of peripheral bands by hyperoxia may in part be responsible for the observed change in permeability.\r"

  ".U": "88213236\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of these experiments was to quantify stagnant intrapulmonary blood caused by a pulmonary arterial occlusion (PAO). The hypothesis was that the diffusing capacity of the lung for CO (DLCO) would be altered little by PAO when measured with the usual inspired concentrations (0.3%) of CO, since stagnant blood distal to the occlusion takes up CO for 20 s or more before significant CO backpressure would develop. However, higher levels of CO (i.e., greater than or equal to 3%) would equilibrate faster with capillary blood (within 5-10 s), and DLCO measured 10-20 s subsequent to the high CO exposure would reflect only the DLCO in the unoccluded regions. Thus the fractional reduction in DLCO measured with 3% CO, with respect to that measured with 0.3% CO, should be related to the fractional occlusion of the pulmonary artery in a predictable way. We occluded the right pulmonary artery (RPAO), the left pulmonary artery (LPAO), or the left lower lobar artery (LLPAO) and found that DLCO measured during rebreathing a 0.3% CO mixture was 80, 87, and 94%, respectively, of the preocclusion value, whereas the DLCO measured during rebreathing a 3.3% CO mixture was 59, 73, and 87% of the preocclusion value. A computer model was developed to predict the reduction in DLCO at different levels of CO exposure that would be caused by varying fractions of PAO. Our data indicated that RPAO corresponded to a 42% vascular occlusion, LPAO a 35% occlusion, and LLPAO a 20% occlusion. Measurement of DLCO using low and high concentrations of CO might be useful in assessing the fraction of vascular bed occluded and in following noninvasively the course of vascular occlusion in a variety of pulmonary diseases.\r"

Body heat flow was also determined indirectly (HM) from metabolic rate corrected for changes in heat stores. At rest at TCW [O2 uptake (VO2) = 0.33 +/- 0.07 l/min, n = 7], HT = 52.3 +/- 14.2 (SD) W, HL = 56.4 +/- 14.6 W, HDIR = 120 +/- 27 W, and HM = 111 +/- 29 W (significantly different from HDIR). TW markedly affected HDIR but only slightly affected HM (n = 22 experiments at TW different from TCW plus 7 experiments at TCW). During light exercise (3 MET) at TCW (VO2 = 1.06 +/- 0.26 l/min, n = 9), HT = 122 +/- 43 W, HL = 130 +/- 27 W, HDIR = 285 +/- 69 W, and HM = 260 +/- 60 W. During severe exercise (7 MET) at TCW (VO2 = 2.27 +/- 0.50 l/min, n = 4), HT = 226 +/- 100 W, HL = 262 +/- 61 W, HDIR = 517 +/- 148 W, and HM = 496 +/- 98 W. Lowering TW at 7-MET exercise (n = 9, plus 4 at TCW) had no effect on HDIR and HM. In conclusion, resting HL and HT are equal. At TW less than TCW at rest, HDIR greater than HM, showing that unexpectedly the shell was still cooling. During exercise, HL increases more than HT but less than expected from the heat production of the working limbs. Therefore some heat produced by the limbs is probably transported by blood to the trunk. During heavy exercise, HDIR is constant at all considered TW; apparently it is regulated by some thermally dependent mechanism, such as a progressive cutaneous vasodilation occurring as TW increases.\r"

Measurements were made in wakefulness, stage 1-2 sleep, and where possible in stage 3-4 sleep. For each of the digital filters we calculated the average power of the oscillatory output. To compare subject groups we first specifically determined the average power in the filter with the maximum output. The mean of this measurement was greater in elderly subjects with apnea compared with those without apnea, both during wakefulness and stage 1-2 sleep. In both groups of subjects the cycle time of the major ventilatory oscillations was on the order of 40-60 s. There was no difference in this cycle time between the two groups of subjects in wakefulness or stage 1-2 sleep. Thus, whereas similar oscillatory processes occur in subjects with and without apnea, it is the magnitude of the oscillation that differs between the two groups. These conclusions are supported by analysis of the output of individual filters of the digital comb filter. In both groups, stage 1-2 sleep produced significantly increased oscillations in ventilation. Both in wakefulness and stage 1-2 sleep, significantly greater periodicities occurred in the apneic compared with the nonapneic group. In the few subjects who had sufficient data in stage 3-4 sleep for spectral analysis, ventilatory oscillations were virtually absent in this state. Our data suggest that subjects who develop apnea during sleep have an increased propensity for periodic breathing even while awake.\r"

We studied seven males with HAPE and seventeen controls at 4,400 m on Mt. McKinley. We measured ventilatory responses to both O2 breathing and progressive poikilocapnic hypoxia. Hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) was described by the slope relating minute ventilation to percent arterial O2 saturation (delta VE/delta SaO2%). HAPE subjects were quite hypoxemic (SaO2% 59 +/- 6 vs. 85 +/- 1, P less than 0.01) and showed a high-frequency, low-tidal-volume pattern of breathing. O2 decreased ventilation in controls (-20%, P less than 0.01) but not in HAPE subjects. The HAPE group had low HVR values (0.15 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.54 +/- 0.08, P less than 0.01), although six controls had values in the same range. The three HAPE subjects with the lowest HVR values were the most hypoxemic and had a paradoxical increase in ventilation when breathing O2. We conclude that a low HVR plays a permissive rather than causative role in the pathogenesis of HAPE and that the combination of extreme hypoxemia and low HVR may result in hypoxic depression of ventilation.\r"

As the bolus was inspired to different depths and then expired, we measured the extent to which the bolus spread. We found that the deeper the bolus penetrated into the lungs, the more it became dispersed. The half-width of the expired bolus was a linear function of the volume to which the bolus penetrated at volumetric penetrations of 100-800 cm3. This suggests that convective mixing is not confined to central airways but can also occur in the lung periphery.\r"

Vessel diameter is derived from changes in the video output signal of the camera or a video recorder when the vessel of interest is displayed horizontally on a monitor and well contrasted with its background. A comparator threshold is set on the filtered video output signal and generates an output pulse that is used to gate horizontal video sync pulses to a digital counter-timer. The number of pulses counted for each video field (no. of horizontal video lines) is proportional to the vessel diameter. The video-derived diameter is calibrated using known standards and correlates well with sonomicrometer-derived diameters of the carotid artery and jugular vein during increasing pressure ramps (r greater than 0.999). The diameter update rate is 60 Hz, and the resolution of the system is one horizontal video line, independent of the vessel size. With suitable magnification and contrast both arteries and veins as small as 200 micron have been measured using this system.\r"

Changes in the caliber of hypopharynx appear to be responsible for the increase in resistance during head flexion.\r"

In hindlimbs perfused with Krebs bicarbonate buffer in a flow-through mode, the rate of release of alanine during perfusion with 2 mM pyruvate plus 5 mM valine was 250 nmol.min-1.leg-1, a rate that is comparable with that reported in hindlimbs perfused with complex medium. Neither the pyruvate-stimulated nor valine plus pyruvate-stimulated rates of release of alanine changed after 20 days of exposure to cold. Isoproterenol inhibited the release of alanine during perfusion with pyruvate, with valine, and with valine plus pyruvate in hindlimbs from a control group of rats. However, in hindlimbs from cold-exposed groups, isoproterenol failed to inhibit the release of alanine during perfusion with valine plus pyruvate and stimulated the release of alanine during perfusion with valine. Aminooxyacetate inhibited the effects of valine, pyruvate, and isoproterenol. The results obtained suggested that cold exposure decreases the responses to isoproterenol of the mechanism of alanine release and causes an increased supply of alanine to the liver.\r"

After exposure the animals were anesthetized with urethan, pulmonary resistance was measured, and the lungs were removed, distended with Formalin, and fixed near functional residual capacity. The effects of lung inflation and bronchoconstriction on airway dimensions were studied separately by distending and fixing lungs with Formalin at total lung capacity (TLC) (n = 3), 50% TLC (n = 3), and 25% TLC (n = 3) or near residual volume after bronchoconstriction (n = 3). On transverse sections of extraparenchymal and intraparenchymal airways the following dimensions were measured: the internal area (Ai) and internal perimeter (Pi), defined by the epithelium, and the external area (Ae) and external perimeter (Pe), defined by the outer border of smooth muscle. Airway wall area (WA) was then calculated, WA = Ae - Ai. Ai, Pe, and Ae decreased with decreasing lung volume and after bronchoconstriction. However, WA and Pi did not change significantly with lung volume or after bronchoconstriction. After cigarette smoke exposure airway resistance was increased (P less than 0.05); however, there was no difference in WA between the smoke- and air-exposed groups when the airways were matched by Pi. We conclude that Pi and WA are constant despite changes in lung volume and smooth muscle tone and that airway hyperresponsiveness induced by cigarette smoke is not mediated by increased airway wall thickness.\r"

Pulmonary arterial and left atrial pressures, cardiac output, lung lymph flow, lymph and plasma protein concentrations, arterial PO2, and numbers of arterial leukocytes were measured in paired experiments in which each sheep served as its own control. We found an increase in protein-rich lung lymph flow during embolization in untreated sheep, indicating an increase in microvascular permeability. When sheep were pretreated with intraperitoneal injections of catalase (50 mg/kg divided over the 24 h before air infusion), vascular pressures, arterial PO2, and leukocyte counts were not different from when the sheep were untreated, but the expected increases in transvascular fluid and protein flow during emboli were significantly attenuated (by approximately 50%). This effect required catalase enzyme activity, as demonstrated by the failure of enzymatically inactivated catalase (by reaction in vitro with aminotriazole in the presence of H2O2) or catalase vehicle (0.1% thymol in water) to affect the lung lymph response to air emboli. We conclude that H2O2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of the acute lung injury caused by intravenous air infusions into unanesthetized sheep. Because both catalase and superoxide dismutase have protected sheep lungs from air emboli-induced increased vascular permeability, a possible specific cause of microvascular barrier injury could be hydroxyl radicals formed from reactions between H2O2 and superoxide anion.\r"

  ".W": "Rats maintained in a hypoxic environment during the 1st wk after birth decrease body growth and O2 consumption (VO2) and increase minute ventilation (VE). At the same time the lungs undergo changes in structure, which suggests a protection of the gas exchange area (Mortola et al. J. Appl. Physiol. 61: 1329-1336, 1986). In this study we asked to what extent these adaptive changes would persist after return to normoxia. Newborn rats were kept in 10% O2 during the 1st wk of life, then returned to normoxic breathing, and measurements were performed weekly. Body weight (BW) increased very little during the week of hypoxia, but after return to normoxia body growth was more than in control rats, and eventually BW reached the control value at 2 mo of age. Both VO2/BW (measured manometrically) and VE/BW (measured by flow plethysmography or by the barometric method) were above control in the 1st wk after hypoxia, probably reflecting the higher O2 demands of the rapidly growing animals. However, VE remained elevated even at 7-8 wk of age (i.e., postpuberty), at a time when both BW and VO2 were as in controls. Measurements of blood gases at this age indicated that the persistent hyperventilation was not due to hypoxemia and was accompanied by hypocapnia and alkalosis. Hematocrit and heart mass-to-BW ratio, elevated in hypoxia, returned to control values within 1 wk, whereas dry lung weight-to-BW ratio remained above the control values as much as during the hypoxic exposure. These results suggest that early postnatal hypoxia in the rat could have long-term effects on the regulation of breathing.\r"

  ".W": "To assess rib cage muscle fatigue and its relationship to diaphragmatic fatigue, we recorded the electromyogram (EMG) of the parasternal intercostals (PS), sternocleidomastoid (SM), and platysma with fine wire electrodes and the EMG of the diaphragm (DI) with an esophageal electrode. Six normal subjects were studied during inspiratory resistive breathing. Two different breathing patterns were imposed: mainly diaphragmatic or mainly rib cage breathing. The development of fatigue was assessed by analysis of the high-to-low (H/L) ratio of the EMG. To determine the appropriate frequency bands for the PS and SM, we established their EMG power spectrum by Fourier analysis. The mean and SD for the centroid frequency was 312 +/- 16 Hz for PS and 244 +/- 48 Hz for SM. When breathing with the diaphragmatic patterns, all subjects showed a fall in H/L of the DI and none had a fall in H/L of the PS or SM. During rib cage emphasis, four out of five subjects showed a fall in H/L of the PS and five out of six showed a fall in H/L of the SM. Four subjects showed no fall in H/L of the DI; the other two subjects were unable to inhibit diaphragm activity to a substantial degree and did show a fall in H/L of the DI. Activity of the platysma was minimal or absent during diaphragmatic emphasis but was usually strong during rib cage breathing. We conclude that fatigue of either the diaphragm or the parasternal and sternocleidomastoid can occur independently according to the recruitment pattern of inspiratory muscles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We evaluated three techniques of measuring respiratory mechanics in the newborn lamb, with the reference method (method 1) being the Mead-Whittenberger technique using flow, volume, and esophageal pressure (Pes) by water-filled catheter, and the other two methods entailing the measurement of mouth pressure (Pm) during airway occlusion (method 2 using end-expiratory occlusion; method 3 using end-inspiratory occlusion). Each technique was evaluated during eupnea and tachypnea in intubated and nonintubated newborn lambs. We found that the use of Pes for the measurement of resistance and compliance gave the most reliable results during both eupnea and tachypnea in both the intubated and nonintubated subjects. The airway occlusion techniques that use Pm to derive resistance and compliance (methods 2 and 3) gave more variable results under all conditions of testing. Method 2 was the least precise method of measurement with a variability of greater than 30% compared with a variation of less than 20% for method 1. For all three methods, it was found that the number of breaths needed for reproducible measurements of mechanics was four to six during eupnea and seven to nine during tachypnea.\r"

Elastase release in recalcified plasma was normal in afibrinogenemic plasma, but 73% less in plasma depleted of fibronectin. Proteolytic digests of fibronectin, but not intact fibronectin (50-1,000 micrograms/ml), induced a concentration-dependent release of neutrophil elastase and lactoferrin. MAbs N293, which recognized the mid-molecule of fibronectin, N294, which was directed toward the 11-kD cell adhesive fragment, and N295, generated against the amino terminal of the 11-kD fragment, inhibited the release of elastase by 7, 24, and 60%, respectively. The cytoadhesive tetrapeptide portion of fibronectin, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (250-1,000 micrograms/ml), released 1.94 +/- 0.10 micrograms/ml of elastase from 10(7) neutrophils, in contrast to the lack of release by the control hexapeptide, Arg-Gly-Tyr-Ser-Leu-Gly. Plasmin appeared to be the enzyme responsible for fibronectin cleavage, since neutrophil elastase release in plasma that had been depleted of plasminogen was decreased and reconstitution of plasminogen-deficient plasma with purified plasminogen corrected the abnormal release. Plasmin cleaved fibronectin to multiple degradation products, each less than 200 kD. This fibronectin digest released 1.05 microgram/ml of elastase from 10(7) neutrophils. We suggest that the activation of plasminogen leads to the formation of fibronectin degradation products capable of functioning as agonists for neutrophils.\r"

The goal of this study was to determine the precise molecular defect in a patient with ADA-deficient SCID whom we previously have shown to have a total absence of ADA mRNA and a structural alteration of the ADA gene. By detailed Southern analysis, we now have determined that the structural alteration is a deletion of approximately 3.3 kb, which included exon 1 and the promoter region of the ADA gene. DNA sequence analysis demonstrates that the deletion created a novel, complete Alu repeat by homologous recombination between two existing Alu repeats that flanked the deletion. The 26-bp recombination joint in the Alu sequence includes the 10-bp \"B\" sequence homologous to the RNA polymerase III promoter. This is the first example of homologous recombination involving the B sequence in Alu repeats. Similar recombination events have been identified involving Alu repeats in which the recombination joint was located between the A and B sequences of the polymerase III split promoter. The nonrandom location of these events suggests that these segments may be hot spots for recombination.\r"

The morphological changes of TNF-induced bowel lesions are indistinguishable from those caused by PAF. The mechanism of TNF-induced bowel necrosis is unclear. In the present study, we have shown that (a) TNF caused PAF production in bowel tissue; (b) the effects of TNF and LPS on PAF production in the intestine are additive; (c) TNF and LPS are synergistic in inducing bowel necrosis; and (d) TNF-induced bowel necrosis is due to PAF release and can be prevented by pretreatment with PAF antagonists.\r"

RL was much greater than epithelial cell resistance, indicating that poor stirring was the limiting factor in absorption and that an appropriate model of stirring should accurately predict absorption. A laminar flow model accurately predicted the absorption rate of both probes at all levels of gut distension, as well as the absorption of glucose when RL was the rate-limiting factor in absorption. In contrast, an unstirred layer model would not have predicted that gut distension would have little influence on absorption, and would have underestimated [14C]warfarin absorption relative to CO. We concluded that in the perfused rat jejunum, laminar flow accurately models luminal stirring and an unstirred layer should be considered to be a unit of resistance in laminar flow, rather than a model of luminal stirring.\r"

As determined by radioimmunoassay, levels of the folate transport protein and the soluble folate-binding protein were 58 +/- 17 (mean +/- SD) and 5 +/- 2 pmol/mg cell protein, respectively, in KB cells maintained in standard medium (containing 2,300 nM folic acid). These levels significantly increased to 182 +/- 34 and 26 +/- 6 pmol/mg cell protein, respectively, in KB cells serially passaged in low folate medium (containing 2-10 nM 5-methyltetrahydrofolate). Increases in folate-binding protein levels occurred more rapidly in KB cells serially passaged in very low folate medium containing less than 2 nM folate and were prevented by the addition of 100 nM 5-methyltetrahydrofolate or 0.1-1 microM 5-formyltetrahydrofolate to this medium. When KB cells which had been passaged in low folate medium were passaged back into either standard medium or low folate medium supplemented with reduced folates, the levels of both folate-binding proteins fell linearly towards the levels in KB cells continuously maintained in standard medium. The folate transport protein was identified in and underwent similar changes in human and mouse mammary tumor cells. These studies indicate that the folate transport system is probably regulated by the extracellular folate concentration through changes in intracellular metabolite levels.\r"

Two of the complement proteins, the third (C3) and fifth (C5) components, are precursors of potent phlogistic molecules, C3a and C5a. C5a has potent chemotactic activity and plays an active role in pulmonary inflammation. We present evidence suggesting that several complement proteins, including C5, are synthesized locally in the lung in alveolar type II epithelial cells. Lung tissue from normal mice synthesized and secreted C5 protein similar to the C5 protein in mouse serum, whereas lung tissue from C5-deficient mice did not. Lung tissues from both normal and C5-deficient mice synthesized C3. Rat lung tissue synthesized and secreted C5, as well as C2, C4, C3, and factor B. Cultures of type II cells (95% type II cells, 5% macrophages) regularly synthesized all these proteins. In contrast, cultures of macrophages alone synthesized large amounts of C2 and factor B, and in some experiments C3 and C4, but never C5. The C5 synthesized by the rat cells was slightly larger than serum C5 (200 kD compared with 180 kD) and was not processed to the two-chain molecule seen in serum. Rat lung tissue and purified type II cells contained C5 mRNA with the same molecular mass as the C5 mRNA in rat liver and in mouse lung and liver. Human type II cells also synthesized C5, as well as C2, C4, C3, and factor B. Human pulmonary macrophages synthesized only C2, factor B, and, in some experiments, C3. Synthesis of complement proteins in cells that line the alveolar wall may provide a local source of these proteins for inflammatory responses in the lung. Local synthesis of complement proteins could be regulated independently of the synthesis in the liver.\r"

Using serum-resistant parental strains (82-40 LP and 23D) containing the 100,000-mol wt protein and serum-sensitive mutants (82-40 HP and 23B) differing only in that they lack the 100,000-mol wt protein capsule, we examined complement binding and activation, and opsono-phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. C3 consumption was similar for all four strains but C3 was not efficiently bound to 82-40 LP or 23D even in the presence of immune serum, and the small amount of C3 bound was predominently the hemolytically inactive iC3b fragment. Consumption and binding of C5 and C9 was significantly greater for the unencapsulated than the encapsulated strains. Opsonization of 82-40 HP with heat-inactivated normal human serum caused greater than 99% killing by human PMN. Similar opsonization of 82-40 LP showed no kill, but use of immune serum restored killing. Findings in a PMN chemiluminescence assay showed parallel results. Association of 32P-labeled 82-40 HP with PMN in the presence of HINHS was 19-fold that for the 82-40 LP, and electron microscopy illustrated that the difference was in uptake rather than in binding. These results indicate that presence of the 100,000-mol wt protein capsule on the surface of C. fetus leads to impaired C3b binding, thus explaining serum resistance and defective opsonization in NHS, mechanisms that explain the capacity of this enteric organism to cause systemic infections.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effect of luminal bicarbonate on calcium reabsorption, rat proximal tubules were perfused in vivo. Perfusion solution contained mannitol to reduce water flux to zero. Total Ca concentration was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry, Ca ion concentration in the tubule lumen (CaL2+) and the peritubular capillary (CaP2+), and luminal pH (pHL) with ion-selective microelectrodes and transepithelial voltage (VTE) with conventional microelectrodes. When tubules were perfused with buffer-free Cl-containing solution, net Ca absorption (JCa) averaged 3.33 pmol/min. Even though VTE was 1.64 mV lumen-positive, CaL2+, 1.05 mM, did not fall below the concentration in the capillary blood, 1.07 mM. When 27 mM of Cl was replaced with HCO3, there was luminal fluid acidification. Despite a decrease in VTE and CaL2+, JCa increased to 7.13 pmol/min, indicating that the enhanced JCa could not be accounted for by the reduced electrochemical gradient, delta CCa. When acetazolamide or an analogue of amiloride was added to the HCO3 solution, JCa was not different from the buffer-free solution, suggesting that HCO3-stimulated JCa may be linked to acidification. To further test this hypothesis, we used 27 mM Hepes as the luminal buffer. With Hepes there was luminal fluid acidification and JCa was not different from the buffer-free solution but delta CCa was significantly reduced, indicating enhanced active calcium transport. We conclude from the results of the present study that HCO3 stimulates active Ca absorption, a process that may be linked to acidification-mediated HCO3 absorption.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms regulating activation of the respiratory burst enzyme, NADPH oxidase, of human neutrophils (PMN) are not yet understood, but protein phosphorylation may play a role. We have utilized a defect in a cytosolic factor required for NADPH oxidase activation observed in two patients with the autosomal recessive form of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) to examine the role of protein phosphorylation in activation of NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system. NADPH oxidase could be activated by SDS in reconstitution mixtures of cytosolic and membrane subcellular fractions from normal PMN, and SDS also enhanced phosphorylation of at least 16 cytosolic and 14 membrane-associated proteins. However, subcellular fractions from CGD PMN plus SDS expressed little NADPH oxidase activity, and phosphorylation of a 48-kD protein(s) was selectively defective. The membrane fraction from CGD cells could be activated for NADPH oxidase when mixed with normal cytosol and phosphorylation of the 48-kD protein(s) was restored. In contrast, the membrane fraction from normal cells expressed almost no NADPH oxidase activity when mixed with CGD cytosol, and phosphorylation of the 48-kD protein(s) was again markedly decreased. Protein kinase C (PKC) activity in PMN from the two patients appeared to be normal, suggesting that a deficiency of PKC is not the cause of the defective 48-kD protein phosphorylation and that the cytosolic factor is not PKC. These results demonstrate that the cytosolic factor required for activation of NADPH oxidase also regulates phosphorylation of a specific protein, or family of proteins, at 48 kD. Although the nature of this protein(s) is still unknown, it may be related to the functional and phosphorylation defects present in CGD PMN and to the activation of NADPH oxidase in the cell-free system.\r"

TNF transcripts were undetectable in resting monocytes. However, in TPA-activated monocytes, TNF mRNA was first detectable by 3 h and reached maximal levels by 12 h of drug exposure. Using run-on transcription assays, the TNF gene was transcriptionally inactive in resting monocytes, but was rapidly activated after TPA exposure. The protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX), had no detectable effect on levels of TNF transcripts in resting monocytes, while this agent superinduced the level of TNF mRNA by 50-fold in TPA-activated cells. TPA activated monocytes were also exposed to actinomycin D and/or CHX to determine whether transcriptional or posttranscriptional control of TNF gene expression was responsible for the induction of TNF transcripts. After 1 h of actinomycin D treatment, the amount of TNF transcripts was reduced by 75%. In contrast, no difference in TNF mRNA levels was observed in TPA-activated monocytes exposed to CHX alone or CHX in combination with actinomycin D. These findings indicated that CHX prevented the degradation of TNF mRNA by inhibiting the synthesis of a labile protein. Run-on transcription assays performed on cells exposed to either TPA or the combination of TPA and CHX further indicated that CHX treatment increased transcription of the TNF gene. Thus, TNF gene expression is controlled at the transcriptional level in resting human monocytes, while both transcriptional and posttranscriptional events regulate the level of TNF transcripts in TPA-activated cells.\r"

Although filamentous F-actin is depolymerized primarily by plasma gelsolin, greater than or equal to 90% 125I-actin injected in either monomeric G- or F-form became complexed eventually with Gc (1:1 molar ratio). Clearance of Gc complexes was much faster (greater than 90% within 5 h) than that of native Gc (t1/2 = 17.2 h). Nephrectomy did not significantly alter the clearance of either Gc or actin. Since Gc complexes are dramatically increased in situations of tissue necrosis such as in fulminant hepatic failure, the current results suggest a crucial role for Gc in sequestration and clearance of released cellular actin.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the role of glucose transport proteins in cellular insulin resistance, we studied subcutaneous adipocytes isolated from lean control, obese control (body mass index [BMI] 33.4 +/- 0.9), and untreated obese non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients (BMI 35.2 +/- 2.1; fasting glucose 269 +/- 20 mg/dl). Glucose transporters were measured in plasma membrane (PM), low-density (LDM), and high-density (HDM) microsomal subfractions from basal and maximally insulin-stimulated cells using the cytochalasin B binding assay, and normalized per milligram of membrane protein. In all subgroups, insulin led to an increase in PM glucose transporters and a corresponding depletion of transporters in the LDM. Insulin recruited 20% fewer transporters to the PM in the obese subgroup when compared with lean controls, and this was associated with a decline in LDM transporters with enlarging cell size in the control subjects. In NIDDM, PM, and LDM, transporters were decreased 50% in both basal and stimulated cells when compared with obese controls having similar mean adipocyte size. Cellular depletion of glucose transporters was not the only cause of insulin resistance, because the decrease in rates of [14C]-D-glucose transport (basal and insulin-stimulated) was greater than could be explained by reduced numbers of PM transporters in both NIDDM and obesity. In HDM, the number of transporters was not influenced by insulin and was similar in all subgroups. We conclude that (a) in NIDDM and obesity, both reduced numbers and impaired activity of glucose transporters contribute to cellular insulin resistance, and (b) in NIDDM, more profound cellular insulin resistance is associated primarily with a further depletion of cellular transporters.\r"

  ".W": "Human epidermal keratinocytes obtained from normal skin attached and spread on thrombospondin (TSP)-coated plastic dishes but failed to attach and spread on untreated plastic culture dishes or dishes coated with fibronectin or laminin. These cells produced minimal amounts of immunoreactive TSP. Keratinocytes established in culture on MCDB 153 medium and maintained for one to three passages in an undifferentiated state by continued cultivation in this low Ca2+-containing medium attached and spread on plastic dishes as well as on TSP-coated dishes. These cells also secreted significant amounts of TSP into the culture medium. When the keratinocytes were incubated for one day in MCDB 153 medium supplemented with high Ca2+ or in MEM (which also contains high Ca2+), there was decreased secretion of TSP into the culture medium concomitant with a reduction in attachment and spreading on plastic culture dishes. Proteolytic fragments of TSP were examined for stimulation of keratinocyte attachment and spreading. A 140-kd fragment produced by removal of the 25-kd heparin-binding domain had similar activity to the intact molecule while the 25-kd fragment was without effect. Further proteolytic treatment of the 140-kd fragment gave rise to a fragment consisting of 120 kd and 18-D moieties held together in disulphide linkage. This fragment did not support attachment or spreading. This study reveals that normal epidermal keratinocytes grown under conditions that maintain the undifferentiated state are able to produce TSP and utilize it as an attachment factor. When keratinocytes are grown under conditions that promote differentiation, ability to produce and utilize TSP is diminished. Since TSP is present at the dermal-epidermal junction and because TSP promotes keratinocyte attachment and spreading, this molecule may play an important role in maintaining normal growth of the basal cell layer and may also participate in reepithelialization during wound repair.\r"

Transient (24 h) treatment with bFGF enhanced [3H]-proline incorporation into collagen 24-48 h after the factor was removed; this effect was DNA synthesis dependent and blocked by hydroxyurea. The collagen stimulated by bFGF was type I, and this effect was observed primarily in the periosteum-free bone. In contrast, continuous treatment with bFGF for 24-96 h inhibited [3H]proline incorporation into type I collagen. bFGF did not alter collagen degradation. In conclusion, bFGF stimulates calvarial DNA synthesis, which causes an increased number of collagen-synthesizing cells, but bFGF has a direct inhibitory effect on collagen synthesis.\r"

Various perturbations involving direct or indirect dissipation of the cellular sodium gradient (ouabain, sodium- or potassium-free solutions, cooling to 18 degrees C) resulted in only a 50% inhibition of indomethacin transport, which raised the question of a co-existent alternative pathway for secretion. Similarly, the anion exchange inhibitor, 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene (DIDS), diminished indomethacin secretion by only 50%. Cooling followed by DIDS or the reverse sequence resulted in additive inhibition such that the combination abolished active secretion of indomethacin. We conclude that active secretion of indomethacin by the proximal straight tubule appears to be in part sodium gradient dependent; the remainder may be driven by an anion exchanger on the basolateral membrane.\r"

  ".U": "88213711\r", 
  ".W": "Biliary secretion of 3 alpha-sulfated bile acids has been studied in Wistar rats with an autosomal recessive defect in the hepatic transport of bilirubin. Liver function, established by measurement of various enzymes in plasma, by enzyme histochemical methods, and by electron microscopy, appeared to be normal in these rats. Serum levels of unconjugated, monoglucuronidated, and diglucuronidated bilirubin were 0.62, 1.62, and 6.16 mumol/liter, respectively, compared with 0.17, 0.08, and 0.02 mumol/liter in control rats. Biliary bilirubin secretion was strongly reduced in the mutant animals: 0.21 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.39 +/- 0.03 nmol/min per 100 g body wt in control rats. Despite normal biliary bile acid output, bile flow was markedly impaired in the mutant animals, due to a 53% reduction of the bile acid-independent fraction of bile flow. The transport maximum for biliary secretion of dibromosulphthalein (DBSP) was also drastically reduced (-53%). Biliary secretion of intravenously administered trace amounts of the 3 alpha-sulfate esters of 14C-labeled taurocholic acid (-14%), taurochenodeoxycholic acid (-39%), taurolithocholic acid (-73%), and glycolithocholic acid (-91%) was impaired in the jaundiced rats compared with controls, in contrast to the biliary secretion of the unsulfated parent compounds. Hepatic uptake of sulfated glycolithocholic acid was not affected in the jaundiced animals. Preadministration of DBSP (15 mumol/100 g body wt) to normal Wistar rats significantly impaired the biliary secretion of sulfated glycolithocholic acid, but did not affect taurocholic acid secretion. We conclude that separate transport systems in the rat liver exist for biliary secretion of sulfated and unsulfated bile acids; the sulfates probably share secretory pathways with the organic anions bilirubin and DBSP. The described genetic defect in hepatic transport function is associated with a reduced capacity to secrete sulfated bile acids into bile; this becomes more pronounced with a decreasing number of hydroxyl groups on the sulfated bile acid's molecule.\r"

Probucol exerted significant antioxidant effects in renal cortical tubules in vitro when exposed to a catalase-resistant oxidant. At 24 h probucol treatment (IP) improved single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) (28.1 +/- 3.3 nl/min) in comparison to untreated ischemic (I) rats (15.2 +/- 3.0), primarily as a result of improving SNGFR in a population of low SNGFR, low flow and/or obstructed nephrons. However, absolute proximal reabsorption remained abnormally low in IP rats at 24 h (5.9 +/- 0.8 nl/min), and cell necrosis was greater than in I rats. Kidney GFR remained low in IP rats due to extensive tubular backleak of inulin measured by microinjection studies. Evaluations after 2 h of reperfusion revealed a higher SNGFR in IP (36 +/- 3.1 nl/min) than I rats (20.8 +/- 2.7 nl/min). Absolute proximal reabsorption was essentially normal (11.6 +/- 1.3 nl/min) in IP rats, which was higher than IP rats at 24 h and the concurrent I rats. Administration of the lipophilic antioxidant, probucol, increased SNGFR and proximal tubular reabsorption within 2 h after ischemic renal failure. Although SNGFR remained higher than I rats at 24 h, absolute reabsorption fell below normal levels and tubular necrosis was more extensive in IP rats. Early improvement in nephron filtration with antioxidants may increase load dependent metabolic demand upon tubules and increase the extent of damage and transport dysfunction.\r"

Under conditions in which the parent cells did not differentiate, a number of hybrids, which were cloned, revealed morphologic and biochemical evidence of differentiation. In addition to activation of human genes within the common nucleus of the hybrids, murine cytoplasmic activators are probably also involved because heterocaryons (fused cells with two interspecific nuclei) revealed the same phenomenon. Hybrids composed of precursors from massively obese subjects disclosed more frequent and prominent differentiation. Since these hybrids, in contrast to those from the lean, recapitulate this phenomenon in subcultures, they provide the potential system for mapping the human gene(s) responsible for adipose differentiation and its exaggeration in massive obesity.\r"

Analysis of quantitative data confirmed that most subtypes were classified correctly on the basis of the proportion of large cells, small cleaved, and large non-cleaved cells, and nuclear, nucleolar, and cytoplasmic features. Morphometry is a more objective and reproducible technique than manual cell counting methods, and the use of cytocentrifuge smears has several advantages compared with conventional histological sectioning. Data derived with the aid of morphometry may be of value in follow up clinicopathological studies.\r"

As there was no known epidemic of parvovirus infection during the study period, this suggests that parvovirus is a relatively common cause of non-immunological hydrops fetalis. In situ hybridisation may have a role in clinical medicine, particularly for retrospective investigations.\r"

Increased error rates were associated with several methods or practices. These included the use of certain culture media; failure to standardise the inoculum; inoculation by loop rather than by swab; failure to use control organisms; failure to measure zone sizes; the use of discs containing a high content of penicillin to test susceptibility to penicillin, and the use of high content discs for testing erythromycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol.\r"

There was an excess of mPAS positive sialic acid in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis, but the increased expression was patchy and coincided with a morphological change in the form of epithelial hyperplasia (metaplasia). Hyperplasia was more common in the rectum and in women and was associated with, and presumably secondary to, active inflammation. It is concluded that variation in the structure of sialic acid is acquired and is therefore unlikely to be implicated in the aetiology of ulcerative colitis.\r"

These were termed antral type duodenal mucosa, transitional type duodenal mucosa (which is also referred to as gastric surface epithelial metaplasia), and jejunal type duodenal mucosa. Antral type duodenal mucosa appeared as a series of finger-like processes 1-3 mm long, circumferentially located around the junction of the antrum and duodenum; transitional type duodenal mucosa extended 2-3 mm beyond this; and the rest of the mucosa was jejunal type duodenal mucosa. The mucosa of the pyloric antrum can therefore lie adjacent to antral type duodenal mucosa, or adjacent to either of the components of transitional type duodenal mucosa.\r"

The distinction was not as clear cut when HbA1 was estimated using electroendosmosis. Seven patients, who at necropsy had no known history of diabetes, had glycated haemoglobin concentrations in the diabetic range. Two of these patients were found to be diabetic, and diabetes had been suspected at some time in another three patients. It is concluded that measurement of glycated haemoglobin or HbA1, in necropsy specimens is a valuable tool for assessing glycaemic control in known diabetic patients, and may be useful in diagnosing previously unsuspected diabetes.\r"

The findings were correlated with clinical history and postoperative outcome. Controls comprised segments of normal vas deferens excised at vasectomy. Twenty of the 40 vasovasostomy specimens showed vasitis nodosa; in 13 this was associated with sperm granulomas and in two with spermatocoeles. The vasitis nodosa was characterised by multiple small ductules extending from the central lumen of the vas into the muscle layers and adventitia. In 14 cases there was mucinous metaplasia of the epithelium lining the ductules. The number of nerve fibres in the submucosa and muscle layers was reduced after vasectomy. In patients with vasitis, however, hyperplasia of nerve fibres in the adventitia (16 of 20 cases) and formation of neuromas were seen. Nerve fibre hyperplasia was seen in only one, and sperm granulomas and spermatocoeles in none of the 20 specimens without vasitis nodosa. The development of vasitis nodosa was independent of the patients' age or the interval between vasectomy and reversal. The restoration of fertility did not seem to be affected by previous vasitis nodosa.\r"

HNE was also present, however, in the granules of neutrophils in the same sections. Non-specific labelling associated with elastin was probably due to binding of IgG to the high numbers of hydrophobic and charged regions known to be present in this molecule, and it is concluded that our findings do not support the existence of high concentrations of elastase in association with elastin in emphysematous lung tissue.\r"

In three progesterone receptor positive tumours there was an apparent paradoxical absence of oestrogen receptor; progesterone receptor normally depends on the presence of oestrogen receptor, but these rare tumours may be essentially progesterone receptor positive. It is concluded that this monoclonal antibody is an appropriate reagent for use in the immunohistological determination of progesterone receptor status of breast carcinomas; that it advantageously identifies both the occupied and unoccupied receptor sites; and that it provides information about tumour cell heterogeneity with respect to receptor status.\r"

Staining in benign breast lesions was weak and heterogeneous when compared with that seen in most infiltrating carcinomas. In situ carcinomas showed an intermediate pattern of staining. The finding of only small foci of weak positivity for D5 antigen in normal and benign breast disease indicated that there are similarities between the expression of D5 antigen and the presence of oestrogen receptor protein in these tissues. A further similarity was seen with in situ carcinomas, which have been shown to have lower oestrogen receptor content than infiltrating carcinomas and a more heterogeneous staining pattern with D5 than is seen in infiltrating tumours. The importance of these findings remains to be evaluated because the precise nature of D5 antigen and its association with the oestrogen receptor molecule is not fully understood.\r"

  ".W": "The prognostic variables from predischarge coronary angiography and left ventriculography in survivors of acute myocardial infarction during the years 1974 to 1978 were evaluated in 143 patients (less than or equal to 66 years of age) with documented myocardial infarction who were then followed up prospectively for 5 years. One half of the study population had triple vessel coronary disease (greater than or equal to 50% stenosis). However, only 7% of patients had severely depressed left ventricular function with an ejection fraction less than or equal to 29%. Evaluation of the contribution of many clinical and angiographic variables to a first cardiac event (death, nonfatal reinfarction or coronary artery bypass surgery) was considered with Kaplan-Meier actuarial curves and multivariate Cox's hazard function analysis. A risk segment was defined as an area of contracting myocardium supplied by a coronary artery with a greater than 50% stenosis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that right plus left anterior descending coronary artery stenoses (p less than 0.01), ejection fraction (p less than 0.01) and the presence of risk segments (p less than 0.05) were significant predictors of outcome. Furthermore, on separate multivariate analyses, the angiographic variables added significantly to the clinical variables to predict cardiac events over 5 years of follow-up. Therefore, in survivors of acute myocardial infarction who undergo cardiac catheterization, additive prognostic information is obtained that can be used to stratify risk over 5 years.\r"

  ".W": "Evaluation of patients with multivessel coronary disease for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty raises the question: Is incomplete revascularization an acceptable procedure in these patients, or does complete revascularization need to be performed, as in coronary artery bypass grafting? To provide an answer the present study utilized exercise thallium imaging as a guide to the performance of angioplasty in 85 patients with multivessel coronary disease. Preangioplasty exercise thallium imaging helped to identify the primary stenosis (\"culprit lesion\") in 93% of patients. Two weeks to 1 month after dilation of this lesion, repeat thallium imaging identified two patient groups: Group 1, 47 patients with no evidence of ischemia in a second vascular distribution and Group 2, 38 patients with evidence of further angioplasty. In Group 2 47% of patients had angioplasty of a second vessel and 79% required multivessel angioplasty at 1 year follow-up. In contrast, only six Group 1 patients (13%) required angioplasty of a second vessel at 1 year. Thus, incomplete revascularization may be an acceptable approach in many patients with multivessel coronary disease. Stress thallium-201 imaging may be a useful technique in the evaluation and management of these patients.\r"

All patients were studied by conventional transthoracic and transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography. Spontaneous echo contrast could be visualized within the left atrium in 35 Group 1 patients (67.3%) (including 7 patients with sinus rhythm) and 26 Group 2 patients (37.1%) (all with atrial fibrillation). Patients with spontaneous echo contrast had a significantly larger left atrial diameter and a greater incidence of both left atrial thrombi and a history of arterial embolic episodes than did patients without spontaneous echo contrast. Association between spontaneous echo contrast and left atrial thrombi and a history of arterial embolization (considered individually or in combination) showed a high sensitivity and negative predictive value. It is concluded that spontaneous echo contrast is a helpful finding for identification of an increased thromboembolic risk in patients with mitral stenosis and after mitral valve replacement.\r"

Cardiac catheterization in all patients before valve dilation revealed heavily calcified aortic and mitral valves with severe stenosis and minimal regurgitation. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed in each patient with a 20 mm balloon dilation catheter passed retrograde through the aortic valve whereas mitral valvuloplasty was performed transseptally with either a single or double balloon technique. After dilation, the mean aortic and mitral gradients decreased in all patients, with the area of the aortic and the mitral valve increasing from 0.5 +/- 0.3 to 0.9 +/- 0.3 cm2 and from 0.7 +/- 0.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.7 cm2, respectively. The procedures were well tolerated, with no embolic events and no significant increase in valvular regurgitation, and resulted in a reduction in symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and weakness in all patients that has persisted for an average of 5.7 months of follow-up in five of the six patients. It is concluded that combined dilation of stenotic aortic and mitral valves can be accomplished percutaneously and may be considered for patients with combined valvular stenosis who refuse or are deferred from surgical intervention.\r"

Aortic regurgitation deceleration time decreased from 1,337 to 625 ms (p less than 0.001). In three patients, aortic regurgitation stopped before end-diastole; in four patients, end-diastole forward flow across the aortic valve was documented. The deceleration time of the mitral valve inflow signal decreased from 303 to 194 ms (p less than 0.001) during balloon inflation, concurrently with an increase in left ventricular diastolic pressure. Mitral regurgitation signals became more prominent during inflation in 10 patients. Changes that occur during balloon inflation in the aortic valve include progressive left ventricular outflow obstruction, equalization of diastolic aortic and left ventricular pressures and changes in diastolic compliance.\r"

The purpose of this study procedure was to determine various Doppler variables predictive of the severity of aortic stenosis and to compare Doppler- and catheterization-derived aortic valve areas. Doppler-derived mean gradient correlated well with corresponding gradient by catheterization (r = 0.86). Peak Doppler aortic flow velocity greater than or equal to 4.5 m/s and Doppler-derived mean aortic gradient greater than or equal to 50 mm Hg were specific (93 and 94%, respectively) for severe aortic stenosis (defined as catheterization-derived aortic valve area less than or equal to 0.75 cm2) but were not sensitive (44 and 48%, respectively). Doppler-derived aortic valve area calculated by the continuity equation correlated well with catheterization-derived aortic valve area calculated by the Gorlin equation when either the time-velocity integral ratio (r = 0.83) or the peak flow velocity ratio (r = 0.80) between the left ventricular outflow tract and the aortic valve was used in the continuity equation. A velocity ratio of less than or equal to 0.25 alone was sensitive (92%) in detecting severe aortic stenosis. Therefore, use of various Doppler-derived values allows reliable noninvasive estimation of the severity of aortic stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "The electrophysiologic effects of circulating epinephrine in humans were examined in four study groups of 10 subjects each. In 10 subjects without structural heart disease (Group 1) and in 10 patients with coronary disease or dilated cardiomyopathy (Group 2) epinephrine infusion at 25 and 50 ng/kg body weight per min for 14 min resulted in an elevation of the plasma epinephrine concentration in the physiologic range. In both groups it produced a dose-dependent decrease in the effective refractory period of the atrium, atrioventricular (AV) node and ventricle and improvement in AV node conduction. Epinephrine facilitated the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia in 3 of the 20 subjects. In Group 3, a beta-adrenergic blocking dose of propranolol was added to the infusion of 50 ng/kg per min of epinephrine. Propranolol not only reversed the effects of epinephrine, but also lengthened these variables compared with baseline values. In Group 4, propranolol was administered first, followed by 50 ng/kg per min of epinephrine. Propranolol alone slowed AV node conduction and mildly prolonged the refractory periods. In the presence of beta-blockade, epinephrine had no effect on AV node properties but resulted in a lengthening of the atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods. In conclusion, epinephrine in physiologic doses shortens the effective refractory period of the atrium, AV node and ventricle, improves AV node conduction and may facilitate the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia. The overall electrophysiologic effects of epinephrine result from stimulation of beta-receptors. Stimulation of alpha-receptors by epinephrine has no effect on the AV node but prolongs the effective refractory period of the atrium and ventricle, partially offsetting the shortening of refractory periods mediated by beta-receptor stimulation.\r"

In one patient with a small right coronary artery, the pathway was along the right free wall. In 11 patients, the pathway was located at or within 15 mm of the coronary sinus os. For these patients, a quadripolar electrode catheter was placed in the coronary sinus and positioned, if possible, so that the proximal pair of electrodes straddled the pathway. For those patients with a pathway greater than 5 mm within the coronary sinus, the most proximal electrode was placed at the os. This proximal pair of electrodes was connected to the cathodal output of a defibrillator with an anterior chest wall patch serving as the current sink. Two shocks were then delivered for a cumulative energy of 500 to 600 J (stored energy). Among the eight patients with a pathway at or within 5 mm of the coronary sinus os, conduction over the pathway was abolished in five and modified in one. Among the four patients with a pathway farther from the os (10 to 15 mm) and along the right free wall, pathway conduction was modified only in two. Rupture of the coronary sinus did not occur in any patient. There were no serious complications. Minor damage surrounding the area of ablation was seen at the time of surgical division of the accessory pathway in two of five patients with unsuccessful ablation who subsequently underwent surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of cryosurgery alone was evaluated in 15 patients with refractory monomorphic sustained ventricular tachycardias related to inferior wall infarction. Patients were 64 +/- 9 (SD) years old and had a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 39.2 +/- 11.2%. Thirty different tachycardias were mapped with the origin localized to the septum or inferior wall in 20 (67%), near the mitral valve anulus in 6 (20%) and at the base of the posterior papillary muscle in 4 (13%) tachycardias. Endocardial cryoablation of these sites was performed with 6 to 13 (mean 9.2 +/- 1.8) cryolesions per heart. No mitral valve replacement was performed. There was one postoperative death as a result of sepsis. Cryoablation abolished inducible ventricular tachycardia in 11 patients. Of the other three patients, the tachycardia in two was controlled with a single antiarrhythmic agent that had previously failed to suppress inducible ventricular tachycardia. Thus, clinical success was obtained in 13 (93%) of 14 patients. The remaining patient received an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Ejection fraction remained unchanged or improved after surgery in 14 patients (93%). There have been no late deaths, recurrence of sustained ventricular tachycardia or significant mitral regurgitation during a mean follow-up period of 19 +/- 7 months. These results compare quite favorably with those previously reported for subendocardial resection alone, and indicate that cryosurgery is highly effective, does not result in deterioration of left ventricular function and preserves mitral valve competence when cryoablation of the posterior papillary muscle is necessary.\r"

The impact of such repetition on both sensitivity and day to day variability in mode of arrhythmia induction was assessed in 24 patients with documented sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Programmed stimulation in the absence of drugs was performed in each patient on 3 separate days. In the first 12 patients, each extrastimulus was scanned through diastole to refractoriness four times if no ventricular tachyarrhythmia was induced (longitudinal repetition); in the second 12 patients, each extrastimulus was delivered four times at a particular coupling interval before the interval was decreased in 10 ms steps to a closer coupling interval (lateral repetition). Day to day reproducibility of the mode of arrhythmia induction was compared with reproducibility in a control group of 18 similar patients studied previously on 3 separate days without repetition. A sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia was inducible in all studies with four or fewer extrastimuli. In the group studied with longitudinal repetition, there was a 25% increased yield of induced ventricular tachycardia due solely to repetition of each extrastimulus scan, and the 95% confidence limit for tachycardia induction with any extrastimulus was achieved by delivering that extrastimulus three times. In the group studied with lateral repetition, there was also an increased yield of induced ventricular tachycardia at any extrastimulus coupling interval achieved by repetitive delivery of that coupling interval.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ejection fraction and cardiac index were determined by two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography at baseline and during peak exercise. Baseline ejection fraction ranged from 14 to 73% and was less than 40% in 6 patients (Group 1) and greater than or equal to 40% in 10 patients (Group 2). Duration of exercise was longer during the VVIR mode (502 s) than during the VVI mode (449 s) (p less than 0.01) and unrelated to baseline ejection fraction. Heart rate during exercise increased 9% in the VVI mode and 35% in the VVIR mode (p less than 0.005). Cardiac index increased 49% in the VVI mode and 83% in the VVIR mode. Analysis of variance for repeated measures showed a significant effect of pacing mode (p less than 0.01) and exercise (p less than 0.001), but not baseline ejection fraction, on cardiac index. Baseline ejection fraction did not correlate with the increase in cardiac index in either pacing mode or with the difference in increase between modes. There was no significant difference between Groups 1 and 2 in exercise duration, peak heart rate-blood pressure (rate-pressure) product, baseline or peak heart rate or baseline or peak cardiac index. Therefore, in selected patients, VVIR pacing during exercise results in an increase in heart rate, duration of exercise and cardiac index that is unrelated to the degree of baseline left ventricular dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The relation between the type and size of myocardial infarcts and collateral development was studied in postmortem human hearts with a new approach that allows quantification of vascular beds. The coronary arteries were perfused with radioactive microspheres and were visualized by injecting a barium-gelatin mixture. The collateral supply was assessed in 6 reference hearts without infarction, 4 hearts with a transmural infarct and 12 hearts with a total of 16 subendocardial infarcts. The distribution pattern of microspheres in hearts in the reference group did not differ significantly from that in hearts with a transmural infarct but was significantly different (p less than 0.01) from that in hearts with a subendocardial infarct, which had a much greater number of microspheres in the collateral-dependent area. Moreover, the lateral zone of myocardium at risk--defined as the area containing viable myocardium but within the distribution zone of the occluded artery--was small in hearts with a transmural infarct (less than or equal to 2 mm), but showed a much wider range in hearts with a subendocardial infarct. This study strongly suggests that collateral vessels play an important role during the development of myocardial infarction, both in determining infarct type (transmural versus subendocardial) and in preserving the viability of the lateral zone of the myocardium at risk.\r"

  ".W": "Aortic stiffness, the maximal frequency shift in the descending aorta divided by the Doppler acceleration time, was studied in 384 eleven year old twin children. The extent to which this measurement provided a prediction of systolic blood pressure that was independent of body size, heart rate, cardiac contractility and left ventricular mass was investigated. Aortic stiffness, after adjustment for height and weight, correlated significantly with systolic blood pressure (r = 0.22, p less than 0.01), but not with diastolic blood pressure. The short- (r = 0.82) and longer- (r = 0.68) term reproducibility of aortic stiffness was high. This measure appears to be a more powerful predictor of systolic blood pressure than is left ventricular mass. Aortic stiffness is a highly reproducible Doppler variable that may explain in part the contribution of the aortic wall elastic properties to the level of systolic blood pressure in preadolescent children at rest.\r"

Cardiac hemodynamics, histologic findings and response to oral L-carnitine therapy were retrospectively evaluated in 11 children with cardiomyopathy associated with abnormal carnitine metabolism. Three had systemic carnitine deficiency, two familial hypocarnitinemia with neutropenia, three transient neonatal hypocarnitinemia and three a carnitine insufficiency syndrome. Six had a hypertrophic and five a dilated cardiomyopathy. Hypotonia was present in seven (64%). The cardiothoracic ratio was greater than 0.60 in eight (73%). The most frequent abnormality on the electrocardiogram was ST-T wave inversion in the left precordial leads with various degrees of left ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiographically, two patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had decreased left ventricular function and two patients with dilated cardiomyopathy had increased thickness of the left ventricular wall. Histologic evaluation (two autopsies and one endomyocardial biopsy) revealed striking lipid accumulation within hypertrophied myocytes. Six of eight patients on carnitine replacement therapy had improvement echocardiographically during a 3 month to 2 year follow-up period. In summary, both hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy can result from abnormal carnitine metabolism. The determination of plasma carnitine concentrations and fatty acid metabolism by-products should be performed in all patients with either form of cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology because carnitine supplementation may lead to improvement.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the immediate effects of an increase in atrial pressure on atrial refractoriness by determining the relation between the atrial pressure and effective refractory period of the atrium. In 21 open chest anesthetized dogs, after the blocking of atrioventricular (AV) conduction by formalin injection, the left atrium and left ventricle were paced sequentially at a fixed cycle length of 300 ms. The AV interval was varied from 0 to 280 ms in 20 ms steps during the recording of aortic and left atrial pressures and refractory period of the left atrium. Mean left atrial pressure was lowest (8.0 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, all values mean +/- SEM) at an AV interval of 47 +/- 3 ms, when refractory period was 135.5 +/- 2.6 ms. Mean left atrial pressure was highest (13.3 +/- 0.5 mm Hg) at an AV interval of 147 +/- 5 ms, when refractory period was 137.9 +/- 2.4 ms (p less than 0.01). Left atrial diameter measured by echocardiography increased from 33.7 +/- 1.8 mm at an AV interval of 47 ms to 37.8 +/- 1.8 mm (p less than 0.01, n = 10) at an AV interval of 147 ms, and mean aortic pressure decreased from 109 +/- 4 to 101 +/- 4 mm Hg. After surgical decentralization of vagal and sympathetic innervation to eliminate baroreflex influence on refractoriness, left atrial refractory period prolonged from 141.6 +/- 3.4 to 145.4 +/- 3.4 ms (p less than 0.01) when mean left atrial pressure increased from 9.5 +/- 0.4 to 15.2 +/- 0.6 mm Hg. A similar relation was noted between right atrial pressure and right atrial refractory period (n = 10) and between left atrial pressure and refractory period of the interatrial septum (n = 12). In six chronically instrumented conscious dogs, left atrial refractory period prolonged from 116.3 +/- 2.3 to 124.2 +/- 1.7 ms (p less than 0.01) when mean left atrial pressure increased from 4.0 +/- 0.8 to 9.0 +/- 0.3 mm Hg. Therefore, an increase in atrial pressure lengthens refractory period of both atria and the interatrial septum in anesthetized and conscious dogs.\r"

Hemodynamic variables, in addition to data on ventricular relaxation, mean circulatory filling pressure and arterial compliance, were measured during an intravenous infusion (0.5 mg/kg per min) of cocaine. Holter monitor recordings (6 h) and coronary arteriograms were also obtained. Cocaine increased (p less than 0.01) mean aortic pressure from 72 +/- 5 to 92 +/- 5, left ventricular systolic pressure from 102 +/- 3 to 121 +/- 5, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 4.9 +/- 1.3 to 8.2 +/- 1.4 and mean circulatory filling pressure from 7.9 +/- 0.4 to 10.9 +/- 0.5 mm Hg. Cardiac index and stroke volume decreased (p less than 0.01) from 166 +/- 17 to 125 +/- 8 ml/min per kg and from 44 +/- 4 to 29 +/- 3 ml, respectively. Ejection fraction decreased (p less than 0.01) from 61 +/- 1 to 49 +/- 3%. Heart rate, first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) and right atrial, mean pulmonary artery and pulmonary artery wedge pressures did not change. The result was a 58% increase in systemic vascular resistance and a 32% decrease in arterial compliance. The pressure gradient for venous return did not change, but resistance to venous return increased 42%. Cocaine prolonged (p less than 0.05) the half-time of left ventricular isovolumic relaxation from 13.4 +/- 0.8 to 16.4 +/- 0.8 ms and the time constant of left ventricular isovolumic relaxation from 19.3 +/- 1.2 to 23.6 +/- 1.1 ms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore, an interlaboratory study was set up. One batch each of egg powder, full-fat milk powder, whole rye flour, whole wheat flour, biscuits, and French beans (snap beans, \"haricots verts\") was thoroughly homogenized. Samples were sent to 19 leading food analysis laboratories in Europe and the U.S., and each performed analyses of macronutrients by its own routine methods. Most were government or semi-government laboratories and major contributors to national nutrient data banks. The results for dry matter content and ash agreed well between laboratories. For protein, the coefficient of variation between laboratories (CV between) ranged from 2.8% to 6.4%. The reproducibility within laboratories was sometimes quite poor. The CV between for total fat ranged from 5.4% to 54%. For \"available\" carbohydrates, the CV between ranged from 9% to 27%. The CV between for total dietary fiber ranged from 23% to 84%. Only part of the variability could be explained by the use of methods of different principle. It is concluded that leading laboratories produce widely different values for macronutrients in common foods. Quality control programs and reference materials of certified nutrient concentration are urgently needed.\r"

Weight is also an important variable in equations that are needed to predict caloric expenditure and in indexes of body composition. Equations to predict the body weight of nonambulatory elderly persons with known errors should make use of body measurements that are indexes of the actual constituents of body composition and that can be collected regardless of an elderly person's level of mobility. The study samples consisted of a validation sample of 228 ambulatory white elderly persons, a cross-validation sample, and a clinical-validation sample of nonambulatory white elderly persons. Equations to predict body weight in the validation sample were derived from recumbent measures of arm and calf circumferences, triceps and subscapular skinfolds, and knee height. The accuracy, sensitivity, and validity of the equations were independently tested in the cross-validation sample; mean signed differences in actual and predicted weight ranged from 0.1 to 1.8 kg. In the clinical-validation sample, the mean differences were larger. Prediction equations are presented using two, three, and four body measurements to allow the selection of an equation based upon those measurements that are possible to collect from a nonambulatory person on an individual basis.\r"

This survey involved the measurement of four parameters: triceps skinfold thickness, mid-upper arm circumference, mid-upper arm muscle circumference, and mid-upper arm muscle area. Measurements were collected from 746 white, noninstitutionalized ambulatory elderly persons living in the Cincinnati area. Age- and sex-specific percentile distributions for the four parameters indicated age-related trends. All four parameters were lowered with advancing age in elderly women and men aged 60 to 89 years. The degree of change with age varied among parameters but was consistently greater in elderly women than in men. Elderly women had larger triceps skinfold thickness but smaller mid-upper arm circumference, mid-upper arm muscle circumference, and mid-upper arm muscle area measurements than did elderly men. These anthropometric findings provide useful standards for ambulatory white elderly people. It is evident that upper arm anthropometry changes with age. As a result, an elderly person's nutritional status should not be evaluated with a single standard for the elderly. Surveys of the elderly should use appropriate age standards to ensure an accurate estimation of obesity or undernutrition in the elderly.\r"

After surgery, subjects were classified into three vitamin supplement groups on the basis of average daily vitamin supplement intake. Subjects taking higher levels of supplements containing the vitamins in question had significantly higher plasma concentrations of the vitamins than those taking low or moderate levels. The mean plasma vitamin values in the moderate supplement group were indicative of adequate status for all vitamins, but plasma vitamin B-12 levels at 12 months post-surgery were significantly lower than pre-surgery levels. In the low supplement group, mean plasma vitamin levels were in or near marginal or deficient ranges.

The strongest desires to improve skills were in the areas of obesity, poor dietary patterns, sports nutrition, food fads, supplement misuse, alternative diets, and eating disorders. There was low interest in strengthening skills in family planning, psychosomatic problems, and handicapping conditions. The implications of the results are discussed. Continuing education methods respondents believed to be most beneficial for learning were small conferences, lectures with ample discussion, and \"hands-on\" workshops.\r"

In the present study, the effects of mouse prolactin on the motility of spermatozoa, in vitro fertilization, and in vitro development of the zygote were investigated in mice using media containing three different concentrations (10, 50, and 100 ng/ml) of mouse prolactin. The development of unfertilized and fertilized oocytes (zygotes) was not affected in vitro by prolactin regardless of the amount of prolactin added to culture media. However, the fertilizing capacity of the spermatozoa was suppressed when they were preincubated for 90 min in culture media containing prolactin at concentrations of 50 and 100 ng/ml. The motility of spermatozoa was not affected by prolactin regardless of the concentration of prolactin used for preincubation. The present study indicates that prolactin may have some effects on the capacitation process of spermatozoa in vitro. This result should be taken into consideration in in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer procedures in humans.\r"

A retrospective chart review was performed on 93 patients who had documented cholesterol levels greater than or equal to 6.20 mmol/L (240 mg/dL) in an outpatient setting to determine the degree of recognition and treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Hypercholesterolemia was diagnosed in 66 percent of patients, dietary recommendations were made in 46 percent, and lipid-lowering medication was prescribed in only 6 percent. Lipid profiles or high-density lipoprotein levels were determined in 22 percent, and thiazide diuretics were being prescribed for 32 percent. There was a trend toward greater recognition and treatment in patients with cholesterol levels greater than 7.75 mmol/L (300 mg/dL) and in patients less than 70 years of age. These results suggest that physician recognition of hypercholesterolemia is greater when compared with previous studies, but more aggressive diagnosis and intervention are needed. Greater utilization of lipid-profile analysis in hypercholesterolemic patients should also be encouraged.\r"

New devices have usually been validated with invasive monitoring as the \"gold standard.\" There is a lack of sound empirical evidence, however, supporting the routine use of these monitors in ambulatory settings. This study evaluated the DINAMAP 8100, an oscillometric automated blood pressure monitor, using the Hawksley Random-Zero Sphygmomanometer as the standard. A sample of 80 normotensive and hypertensive ambulatory patients from the Department of Family Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina were studied. A clinical trial was conducted in which readings from the DINAMAP 8100 were compared with those from the Hawksley Random-Zero Sphygmomanometer, in a 2 (instrument) X 2 (arm) X 2 (investigators) X 4 (pairs of simultaneous measurements) factorial design. The DINAMAP 8100 overestimated systolic readings (mean difference = 7.6 +/- 9.1 mmHg, P less than .0001, paired t test). More than one third of systolic measurements and one quarter of diastolic measurements were greater than 10 mmHg discrepant from the standard. The results of this study suggest that routine use of the DINAMAP 8100 would lead to serious misclassification errors in screening for hypertension and in the follow-up of known hypertensive patients. The DINAMAP 8100, therefore, is not an appropriate instrument for routine use in primary care settings.\r"

Two thousand four hundred seventy-eight routine Papanicolaou smears were reviewed from the Department of Family Practice and the Department of Gynecology for the presence of these cells. A retrospective review showed approximately 25 percent cell recovery in women aged over 45 years from both departments. Recovery on the family practice service, however, was 19.4 percent greater than recovery on the gynecology service for younger women (57 percent vs 37.6 percent). Two prospective interventions were introduced in family practice in an attempt to improve these rates. A combined spatula-saline swab technique did not improve cell recovery in either age group. A combined spatula-Cytobrush cell collector technique, however, dramatically improved endocervical cell recovery by 200 percent in older women and by 57 percent in younger women. This method significantly improves endocervical cell recovery and may therefore improve the value of the Papanicolaou smear as a cancer screening test.\r"

The stimulus, response, and interactional models of stress are discussed, and the development of a new stress measure, the Brief Encounter Psychosocial Instrument (BEPSI), is detailed. The reliability of this six-item instrument is demonstrated (Cronbach's alpha .80). Validity is measured through correlation with a variety of instruments measuring stress, including depression (r = .52, P less than .001), anxiety (r = .61, P less than .001), life change (r = .56, P less than .001), bodily expression of stress (r = .56, P less than .001), and a total stress score (r = .67, P less than .001). The BEPSI also demonstrated appropriate negative correlations with family cohesion (r = .29, P = less than .01) and support (r = .31, P = less than .01). When the single open-ended item is strongly positive, 77 percent of patients also score high on the BEPSI. A negative response to the same question corresponds to a low BEPSI value 52 percent of the time. Suggestions are made regarding clinical and research applications.\r"

It is not known whether these differences in practice style are associated with differences in outcomes of care such as patient satisfaction. This study examined whether patients of family physicians and general internists have different perceptions of the care they receive. National samples of recently trained family physicians and general internists were asked to complete questionnaires about their practices and to record information on all patient encounters during a three-day period. Three patients were randomly sampled from among those seen by each physician during the study period and were sent questionnaires that included questions about their satisfaction with the medical care they were receiving from the physician. Two hundred thirteen adult patients who saw 124 family physicians and 218 adult patients who saw 98 general internists participated in this study. Patients of general internists and of family physicians reported similar levels of satisfaction on all four dimensions measured (access, humaneness, quality, and general satisfaction) even after controlling for the effects of a variety of patient, practice, physician, and encounter characteristics. It is concluded that the fundamental differences in practice style that have been reported between family physicians and general internists do not seem to be associated with differences in patient satisfaction.\r"

This paper outlines a method for developing instruments designed in one culture for use in a second, and particular attention is given to cross-cultural validity or equivalence. Five types of equivalence are enumerated and defined: content, semantic, technical, criterion, and conceptual equivalence. These concepts are illustrated by examples from the authors' experience in research on internal migrants in Peru.\r"

Diagnosis, severity, and location of TD symptoms were related to cognitive dysfunction. Total symptom severity correlated significantly negatively with 10 of 14 WAIS scores and with four of seven Wechsler Memory scores in the total group with combined schizophrenic and affective patients. The magnitude of the relationships between TD symptom severity and cognitive deficit was strongly affected by the location of the symptoms and the diagnosis of the patient. In the total group, severity of facial TD symptoms correlated significantly negatively with 11 of 14 WAIS scores and with all eight memory scores. TD symptoms in the extremities correlated significantly negatively with only two WAIS and two memory scores, whereas truncal TD symptoms did not correlate significantly negatively with any WAIS or memory scores. Patients diagnosed as schizophrenic showed significant negative correlations of total TD symptom severity with 12 of 14 WAIS scores and with seven of eight Wechsler Memory Scale scores. Patients diagnosed as having affective disorder showed only one significant correlation between total TD symptom severity and WAIS or memory scores. Length of institutionalization has been found to be related to TD symptoms in schizophrenic but not affective patients. In the present study, institutionalization was negatively correlated with severity of facial TD symptoms but not with severity of TD symptoms of the trunk or extremities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Projected population fluctuations were used to predict trends in adolescent suicide rates to the year 2000: the current decrease in rates is predicted to continue until the mid-1990s. Recent data indicating a decrease in adolescent suicide rates tend to support the population model hypothesis. The data suggest that demographic variables may be of explanatory and predictive use in understanding the epidemiological trends of suicide. Early intervention and prevention strategies emerge from this model, and various social, public health, and research implications exist. However, the results must be viewed with caution because of the methodological problems inherent in using national mortality data, the possibility that other variables may account for the observed relationships, and the length of time required to test such prospective epidemiological propositions.\r"

In the present study, 64 genetically characterized gliomas were evaluated to determine if tumors with amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), N-myc, c-myc, or gli genes had distinctive histopathologic features. There was no significant difference in age (p = 0.10) or gender (p = 0.78) between patients whose tumors contained amplified genes and those whose tumors did not exhibit this characteristic. Although the patients with amplified genes in their tumors survived slightly longer than patients whose tumors had no detectable gene amplification, these differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.21). The 28 tumors with amplification included 24/48 (50%) glioblastoma multiforme, 2/6 (33%) anaplastic astrocytomas and 2/5 (40%) gliosarcomas. No amplification was seen in one oligodendroglioma, three anaplastic mixed gliomas or one giant cell glioblastoma multiforme. Necrosis and endothelial proliferation were equally prevalent among tumors with and without amplification. Comparison of tumors with gene amplification and tumors without this characteristic revealed similar distributions of most morphologic cells types. Although prominent perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates were more frequent in tumors without amplification, this association was of borderline significance statistically. In situ hybridization of tumors with amplification using an EGFR mRNA probe showed intense labeling of different neoplastic cell types including fibrillary and protoplasmic astrocytes, gemistocytes, anaplastic cells, and multinucleated giant cells. Non-neoplastic cells such as hyperplastic endothelium within the tumors did not express detectable EGFR mRNA. These studies demonstrate that (a) cells with quite different morphology within the same tumor can contain the same genetic alteration; (b) tumors of identical histological appearance may have arisen and evolved by different molecular mechanisms; and (c) molecular analyses are necessary to evaluate gene amplification in MHG since this characteristic cannot be accurately predicted by the morphologic or clinical criteria used in this study.\r"

We found eight time-related patterns of CNS myelination during the first two postnatal years in autopsied infants. The intensity of myelination was graded in 162 infants with diverse diseases on an ordinal scale of degrees 0-4. The Ayer method for maximum likelihood estimates for censored data was utilized to generate curves of the temporal changes in the percent of infants with degrees 0 through 4 of myelin in 62 white matter sites. These sites fall into eight subgroups determined by the presence or absence of microscopic myelin (degree 1) at birth and the median age at which mature myelin (degree 3) is reached. There is variability in the timing of myelination within and across axonal systems, and early onset of myelination is not always followed by early myelin maturation. We reexamined general rules governing the timing of myelination proposed by previous investigators, and found that those rules are neither complete nor inviolate, and that there is a complex interplay among them. This study specifies distinct periods of maturation in which myelinating pathways are potentially vulnerable to insult during the first two postnatal years.\r"

  ".W": "The histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease have long been considered to be neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and neuritic (senile) plaques (SP). Neither of these structures, however, are unique to Alzheimer's disease, and both probably represent end-stage markers of the disorder. NFT have been demonstrated in many disorders; SP occur in small numbers with normal aging. Evidence is presented for elevation of phosphomonoesters (PME) in Alzheimer's brain compared to non-Alzheimer's diseased controls and normal controls. The PME detected by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of autopsy brain are predominantly anabolic precursors of membrane phospholipids. Elevated PME could be secondary to a metabolic block at the rate-limiting enzyme in membrane phospholipid synthesis, which is cytidine triphosphate (CTP): phosphocholine (or phosphoethanolamine) cytidyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15). Elevated PME could also be secondary to decreased breakdown of PME by phospholipase D activity. Since CTP: phosphocholine cytidyltransferase is inactivated by phosphorylation and since there is independent evidence for hyperphosphorylation of tau and MAP-2 proteins in AD brain, enhanced protein kinase activity could be a common factor. Preliminary evidence suggests that PME could interact with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and potentially act as false neurotransmitters. Further studies will be needed to investigate these possibilities.\r"

The sections were pretreated with 2,2'-dipyridyl and sodium hydrosulfite to remove iron and to reveal the antigenic sites. In siderotic cerebellar cortex, ferritin reaction product occurred in the hemosiderin matrix, the cell bodies and processes of Bergmann glia, and in microglia. Astrocytes other than Bergmann glia did not contain ferritin reaction product. RCA-1 stained microglia and hemosiderin whereas antisera to alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin only reacted with iron-depleted granules. The selective vulnerability of the eighth cranial nerve was explained by the presence of ferritin-reactive and lectin-positive microglia. Hemosiderin isolated from frozen cerebellum contained ferritin, GFAP, and vimentin. The presence of the intermediate filament proteins was likely due to co-localization with hemosiderin granules in Bergmann glia. The ability of the brain to biosynthesize ferritin in response to prolonged contact with hemoglobin iron is thought to be the most important factor in the pathogenesis of superficial siderosis. The great severity of the lesion in the exposed cerebellar cortex is readily explained by accelerated ferritin biosynthesis in Bergmann glia.\r"

In the nerve distal to the crush degenerating axons demonstrated intra-axonal A-LI, and by one wk most of the Schwann cells also showed A-LI. As regenerating sprouts entered the distal nerve, those Schwann cells in contact with sprouts lost their A-LI, while those cells not in contact with axons retained immunoreactivity up to eight wk after injury. Proximal to the nerve crush many axons showed intra-axonal A-LI from one to two wk after injury, despite appearing normal ultrastructurally. This immunoreactivity diminished as the distance from the crush site increased. Many Schwann cells proximal to the crush also showed A-LI from one to four wk after injury. These findings suggest that an albumin-like protein may play a role in the response of Schwann cells and axons to injury.\r"

  ".W": "A morphological and quantitative investigation was carried out in the peripheral nerves of adult rats, which were first exposed to 4% lead acetate in the drinking water and then restored to standard laboratory conditions. After six weeks of continuous lead exposure, the only cells involved were Schwann cells (SC) and endothelial cells (EC). As compared to age-matched controls, the most conspicuous changes observed by light and electron microscopy in these cells included the presence of nuclear inclusion bodies (NIB), cytoplasmic hypertrophy, mitochondrial abnormalities, an increased number of myelin-derived SC intracytoplasmic structures, and vesiculation of myelin sheaths. By counting the number of nuclear profiles containing NIB in semithin sections stained with basic fuchsin and methylene blue, we found that SC from predominantly cutaneous (sural) nerves were less vulnerable to lead than SC from mixed (peroneal) and muscular (tibial) nerves. With respect to EC, however, no significant differences were found among these three nerves. After termination of lead exposure, we observed a gradual decrease of most of the above cellular changes, which finally disappeared at day 30 post-intoxication. However, the number of myelin-related SC cytoplasmic bodies still remained above normal levels at the time of the termination of the experiment (60 days post-intoxication). The nature of the changes induced by lead in peripheral nerve cells as well as the rapid and nearly complete recovery suggest that they reflect a compensatory response to overcome the adverse effects of the lead on cell metabolism.\r"

The diagnosis was encephalomyeloradiculitis possibly of viral origin, and treatment with immunosuppressants was initiated. An alternating course with a tendency towards improvement ensued. Two and a half years after the occurrence of the initial symptoms, identification of specific antibodies in the blood and CSF led to the diagnosis of borreliosis with CNS involvement. High-dose therapy with penicillin rapidly reduced the symptoms, beginning with those of radicular pain and followed by an improvement of the mental state. Attention is directed to the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms of chronic borreliosis with CNS involvement. Previous reports that immunosuppression may result in some improvement but with a tendency towards relapse are confirmed. Our encouraging treatment results support those of other reports that penicillin therapy may lead to improvement even at late chronic stages in patients with severe CNS deficits.\r"

The most prominent abnormality in patients with early-onset DAT was a 44% reduction in the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose and a fourfold increase of lactate production, whereas cerebral blood flow and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen were found not to be altered. The cerebral amino-N balance substantially changed in patients with early-onset DAT, showing a massive loss of amino acids and ammonia from the brain, which was indicative of excess protein catabolism due to cell degeneration in the acutely diseased brain. The abnormality found in glucose metabolism may suggest a perturbed control of glycolytic breakdown of glucose and its first oxidation step at the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex level, this thus being of pivotal significance in early-onset DAT.\r"

The serum concentration of primidone was as expected, whereas those of the metabolites phenyl-ethyl-malonamide and phenobarbitone were very low.

In patients suffering from limb-girdle dystrophy the increases in CK activity and Mb concentration were also pronounced. However, there were families with normal and others with elevated CK and Mb levels in facioscapulohumeral dystrophy. In neurogenic atrophies both CK and Mb levels generally increased only slightly. Serum Mb and CK levels have similar values as indicators of muscle damage in primary and secondary skeletal muscle disorders. The serum Mb level helps in the detection of carriers but is not more sensitive than CK measurement.\r"

It may be that in Fahr disease some factors, such as chronic respiratory alkalosis, could lead to hypoparathyroidism-like changes in the brain tissue. Abolition of the phosphaturic response to parathormone (PTH) was recently demonstrated in acute experimental hypocapnia. In three adult patients with Fahr disease, a tendency towards compensatory respiratory alkalosis and arterial hypocapnia was found. The parathormone test revealed a marked decrease in phosphaturia response to PTH, but normal cAMP response. In one patient, the parathormone test was repeated during propranolol administration and showed a considerable improvement in the phosphaturic response to parathormone. It is postulated that chronic hyperventilation and hypocapnia as well as phosphaturic resistance to PTH, intracellular increase of phosphate concentration and development of hypoparathyroidism-like intracranial calcification in patients with Fahr disease could all be caused by disturbance of adrenergic receptors and their relationship to PTH receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The Kaiser Permanente Multiphasic Evaluation Study is often cited as evidence from a randomized trial that screening sigmoidoscopy reduces mortality from colorectal cancer. To examine the role of sigmoidoscopy in this reduction, we reviewed the 110 incident cases of colorectal cancer occurring among the 10,713 subjects from randomization in 1964 through 1982. Tumor stage at diagnosis, location, mode of discovery, and current mortality status were determined for each. We also reanalyzed chart review data for the years 1965 through 1974 to assess the difference in exposure to sigmoidoscopy between groups. Study group subjects, who were urged to have annual multiphasic health checkups (MHC), had both a lower cumulative incidence (4.3 vs 6.7 cases per 1000 persons) and a better stage distribution (86 vs 54% Stage B or better) than nonurged control subjects for colorectal cancers arising within reach of the sigmoidoscope. The lowered incidence accounted for two-thirds of the total difference in mortality. No appreciable difference in removal of colorectal polyps was seen between groups. Only a slight excess in exposure to sigmoidoscopy was seen in the study group (30 vs 25% of subjects examined at least once between 1965 and 1974), which was unlikely to account for more than a small fraction of the study group's decrease in mortality. Although the Multiphasic Evaluation Study did find a significantly lower mortality from colorectal cancer in the study group, it did not achieve a substantial difference in exposure to sigmoidoscopy. Its results are therefore inconclusive with respect to sigmoidoscopy and should not be used as evidence either for or against sigmoidoscopic screening.\r"

Subjects in Poor control reported more positive and neutral life events during the past year, suggesting even those life changes individuals view benignly may be associated with metabolic control difficulties. Individuals in Poor control also reported more recent symptoms of depression, anxiety and hostility than did individuals in Moderate or Very Good control--symptomatology which may further impair their ability to adhere to a complex self-care regimen. Individuals with Long disease duration reported more positive and negative recent life experiences than did subjects with Short disease duration, but did not evidence concomitant disruptions in metabolic control. The role experience with a chronic disease may play in this finding was unclear, however. Although more research is required to clarify the exact relation of psychosocial variables and diabetic control, these findings suggest that clinically relevant subgroup parameters, subjects' perceptions of life change, and demographic variables may be important factors to assess.\r"

  ".U": "88214428\r", 
  ".W": "Previously reported data from a randomized controlled trial showed that admission to the geriatric evaluation unit (GEU) and follow-up clinic at the Sepulveda VA Medical Center leads to significantly improved outcomes for frail elderly hospital patients--including a 50% reduction of one-year mortality (p less than 0.005). In the present paper, two-year survival curves for GEU and control groups are reported. In addition, we subdivided the population by potential baseline risk factors (both patient- and treatment-related) and examined one-year survival using 12-month survival curves and odds ratios. There is evidence for GEU-related survival effects in specific subgroups of patients (e.g. patients with heart and pulmonary disease, patients with low baseline scores in functional status and mental status, and patients with high baseline morale scores). Finally, employing stepwise logistic regression, we determined the predictors of one-year survival in the pooled study population. These factors were: assignment to the GEU (adjusted odds ratio = 2.45; p less than 0.001); not having a heart diagnosis (2.24; p less than 0.001); and having primarily \"geriatric/rehabilitation\" problems (1.95; p less than 0.005). A predictive model derived from the regression defines patient subgroups likely to survive only when assigned to the GEU: cardiac patients with primarily \"geriatric\" or \"rehabilitation\" problems, and non-cardiac patients whose problems are primarily \"medical\". The dramatic effect of the GEU on survival appears to be concentrated on certain identifiable subgroups of patients who might be targeted to maximize program cost-effectiveness.\r"

The study population consisted of 89 actively symptomatic patients seen on 1082 occasions in eight medical centers. Multiple regression analyses identified three variables which predicted the ratings of physicians: stool frequency, abdominal pain and sense of well-being. The new index correlated very well (r = 0.87, p less than 0.001) with the Crohn's Disease Activity Index from which it was derived. The index may be used in epidemiologic studies to accurately place patients into quartiles of disease severity which correspond to similar quartiles of the CDAI.\r"

Until recently the sole focus of the relationship has been between morbidity and the degree of overweight which is usually measured as weight relative to height. Recently we have shown that the location of body fat is not only associated with morbidity but that this relationship is independent of the total amount of adipose tissue. Clinical studies have shown that adipocyte size, location and metabolism are related to fat distribution. An excess of large fat cells in the upper body explains the increase risk of diabetes in women. The location of body fat has been used to delineate three body types: gynoid (pear shape), intermediate, and android (apple shape). We used waist girth divided by hip girth for scaling body shape and found that it is associated with morbidity after adjustment for relative weight. The use of relative weight and body shape simultaneously gives a better estimate of risk of morbidity than either alone. This study of 44,820 women presents easy to read graphs, derived from the multiple logistic model, which will permit practicing physicians to estimate visually the combined risks associated with relative weight and body fat location.\r"

The severity of OA for each of 32 joints of the fingers and wrists was recorded for each individual. Attention was restricted to the 3035 participants who were 32 years of age or older and for whom a diagnosis of OA was available for each of 32 joints. Joint-specific prevalence rates of OA increased sharply with age for both sexes, and at the older ages, the prevalence rates for most joints were higher for females. Older individuals with OA also had a greater number of affected joints, with females having a greater number of affected joints than males. Of those individuals aged 44 years or younger, only 6.2% had one or more joints affected with OA. The percentages were 21.6 and 42.0% for those aged 45-59 years and 60 or more years, respectively. The distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints were the most frequently affected joints in all age categories for both sexes and OA in the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints was positively associated with OA in the DIP joints. However, controlling for the number of affected DIP joints, the PIP joints of older subjects were more likely to exhibit OA than the PIP joints of younger subjects. Though there is an association between OA in the DIP and PIP joints, there was only a small, nonsignificant association (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.83, 1.84) between disease in the DIP and PIP joints of the same finger.\r"

The CQLI could be completed by almost all subjects. Good test-retest reliability was established. The subjects were able to discriminate between degrees of caregiver wellbeing using standardized states and the CQLI scores discriminated among groups of subjects. The CQLI detected within-subject change in caregivers whose relatives received institutional respite care. The CQLI appears to be feasible, reliable, valid, and responsive to change.

Data were obtained on 867 single live-born infants and their mothers who participated in a randomized anti-smoking intervention trial. Smoking was measured for the women at about 15 weeks gestation and again during the eighth month. Although all indicators of dose, as derived from early or late pregnancy smoking measures, were significantly associated with birth weight, whether or not the mother had quit smoking by the time of the 8th month follow-up was almost as predictive as any dose variable. For women who quit smoking before 30 weeks gestation, neither the duration nor the amount of smoking earlier in pregnancy was an important determinant of birth weight.\r"

Sensitivity, specificity and predictive value are not appropriate for this use. The likelihood ratio has been proposed as a useful measure when using a test to diagnose one of two disease states (e.g. disease present or absent). In this paper, we generalize the likelihood ratio concept to a situation in which the goal is to diagnose one of several non-overlapping disease states. A formula is derived to determine the post-test probability of a specific disease state. The post-test odds are shown to be related to the pre-test odds of a disease and to the usual likelihood ratios derived from considering the diagnosis between the target diagnosis and each alternate in turn. Hence, likelihood ratios derived from comparing pairs of diseases can be used to determine test utility in a multiple disease diagnostic situation.\r"

The method was applied in two fashions; first, using three data sources in a modeling approach: and second, using two data sources and standard, simple capture-recapture methods. The modeling approach is more flexible, since several variables that influence cancer registration can be considered and can be used to identify reporting patterns of different data sources. In the present analysis, estimates of completeness of the registry as a whole were remarkably similar using either two or three data sources, and site-specific comparisons differed by at most 7%. Because of the advantages of capture-recapture methods-estimation of level of completeness, possible comparability of estimates across different registries, and versatility to consider other determinants of cancer registration-a plea for greater use of these methods in cancer registration is made.\r"

  ".W": "Contradictory results among randomized clinical trials addressing similar questions are common and occur when the conclusions of different groups of investigators disagree, or when the results of several trials are statistically inconclusive. Meta-analysis, a term used to describe the process of evaluating and combining the results of conflicting studies, has been proposed as a method for reconciling the contradictory results. In this review of meta-analyses, we distinguish between the pooled and methodologic techniques, described the highly variable strategies used, and propose guidelines for improving the conduct of meta-analyses. In pooled analyses the results of multiple clinical trials are combined and the outcome is compared for patients receiving the principal and comparative therapy. In methodologic analyses the clinical trials are judged according to a set of standards used to assess scientific validity and clinical applicability. Since neither technique alone appeared satisfactory for resolving the conflicting results, we propose an approach to meta-analysis that requires methodologic criteria to identify scientifically valid studies, and pooling criteria to combine data from each of the studies. We believe this new strategy of meta-analysis will have enhanced scientific validity and clinical applicability.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-two patients with malignant hypercalcemia were treated with a single dose of 3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene-1,1- bisphosphonate (AHPrBP, previously APD), a potent inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. In order to establish a dose-response in humans, patients were divided into four groups receiving 30 mg, 45 mg, 60 mg, or 90 mg, respectively, as a 24-hour infusion. Initial plasma calcium was similar in all groups, except in the group receiving 90 mg, of which some patients had higher initial values. All patients responded to AHPrBP with a rapid decrease of plasma calcium concentration from 3.47 +/- 0.10 mmol/L at day 0 to 2.43 +/- 0.06 at day 6 (P less than .001). Plasma calcium became normal within four to six days in 43 patients. Eight of the nine patients whose calcium did not become normal were in the low-dose (30 and 45 mg of AHPrBP) groups. Slight and asymptomatic hypocalcemia occurred in only tow of the 26 patients in the low-dose groups, but in six of the 26 patients in the high-dose groups. A follow-up study in 40 patients showed that hypercalcemia recurred within 1 month in five of ten patients in the group receiving 30 mg, in three of ten patients in the group receiving 45 mg, and in one of 20 patients in the groups receiving 60 and 90 mg, whereas mortality was almost identical in all four groups. In all groups, plasma phosphate, plasma creatinine, urinary calcium, and hydroxyproline excretion decreased significantly. In conclusion, when administered as a single-day infusion in the treatment of tumor hypercalcemia, AHPrBP leads to a dose-dependent decrease in plasma calcium. To prevent transient hypocalcemia and early relapse, the optimal dose should be adapted to the degree of severity of hypercalcemia.\r"

We compared the outcome for patients seen before 1980--a group primarily managed with orchiectomy and regional radiation--with those seen from 1980 to 1986--a prospectively and consecutively gathered group who were offered brief chemotherapy in addition to standard orchiectomy and irradiation. The historical and study groups were similar in clinical characteristics. However, the chemotherapy group had a better relapse-free survival, 93% v 50% (P less than .02), and overall survival, 93% v 50% (P less than .02). With a median follow-up of 44 months in the chemotherapy group, it is clear that the use of early, brief chemotherapy strongly alters the natural history of testicular lymphoma by preventing relapses, the large majority of which occur early after regional therapy. We conclude that a program incorporating orchiectomy, early brief chemotherapy, and involved-field radiation therapy confers the following benefits on patients with primary testicular lymphoma: (1) laparotomy is not needed for staging; (2) relapses, including those in the opposite testicle and CNS, are largely prevented; and (3) toxicity can be kept to a modest level acceptable in elderly patients.\r"

The mean initial volume of mediastinal disease in 34 patients treated with mantle and para-aortic irradiation was 166 mL, whereas for 19 patients treated with two to six cycles of multiagent chemotherapy and mantle and para-aortic irradiation the mean initial volume was 446 mL. Preliminary data suggested that patients with mediastinal volumes of less than 200 mL had a lower mediastinal relapse rate (13%) than patients with volumes greater than 200 mL (32%). For 12 patients receiving six cycles of nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP), those with a greater than 85% reduction in volume 1 to 2 months after chemotherapy had a lower incidence of mediastinal relapse (zero of six, 0%) compared with patients having 85% or less reduction in volume (four of six, 67%). The primary value of this technique is that it provides a sensitive assessment of response to treatment and may aid in monitoring the effectiveness of a given treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Surgery alone is inadequate therapy for limited small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), resulting in less than 5% long-term survival. Since 1976, we treated patients undergoing surgery for SCLC with adjuvant chemotherapy in an attempt to prolong survival and increase cure. Seventy-seven patients who underwent surgery as their primary treatment were identified, and of these 63 (46 male and 17 female) received chemotherapy. Fifteen patients had a pneumonectomy, 46 a lobectomy, and two had wedge resections. Six patients had positive microscopic resection margins. Pathologic staging showed tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) involvement as follows: T1N0, eight; T2N0, ten; T1N1, six; T2N1, 18; T1N2, five; T2N2, nine; T3N0, three; T3N1, one; and T3N2, three. All patients received cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (doxorubicion; Adria Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario), and vincristine; four also received etoposide (VP-16) and cisplatin, one VP-16, and four methotrexate, procarbazine, and lomustine (CCNU). Forty-nine patients received prophylactic cranial irradiation, and 35 received radiotherapy to the mediastinum and primary site. The overall median survival of the 63 patients is 83 weeks, and the projected 5-year survival is 31%. Patients with T1 or T2 tumors without nodal involvement had a median survival of 191 weeks, and projected 5-year survival of 48%. Stage II (T1N1, T2N1) and stage III (any T3 or T1-2N2) patients had median survivals of 72 weeks and 65 weeks, and projected 5-year survivals of 24.5% and 24%, respectively. Thirty-three patients have relapsed and died of disease. Only two patients had an isolated relapse at the primary site. Seven other patients have died without recurrent disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery results in prolonged survival and cure for a significant number of patients with stage I SCLC, although nodal involvement at any level is associated with shorter survival.\r"

Actuarial 5-year local control and disease-free survival rates were 86% and 70%, respectively. The success rate improved during this time period. Namely, the local control rates for 1971 to 1975, 1976 to 1980, and 1981 to 1985 were 81%, 81%, and 94%, respectively. For the same time periods, the 5-year disease-free survival rates were 64%, 70%, and 76%. One hundred thirty-one patients were treated with postoperative radiation, and 89 with preoperative radiation. In the most recent 5-year period, the local control rates were 91% and 97% for the two groups (number of patients being 50 and 57 in the post- and preoperative groups, respectively). Treatment by preoperative radiation appears to have a major advantage for patients with very large sarcomas, ie, greater than 15 cm in maximum dimension. None of our patients with local control of grade 1 sarcoma have developed distant metastasis (DM). In contrast, among patients with grade 2 or 3 sarcomas, there is a relentless and progressive increase in the frequency of DM with size of the primary lesion, namely, 6% at less than or equal to 2.5 cm, congruent to 60% at 15 to 20 cm, and congruent to 80% at greater than 20 cm.\r"

Such comparisons may be used to suggest mechanisms by which cytotoxic agents function in the cancer patient, especially regarding the importance of the effect of dose on the individual patient. However, analyses of \"time-to-failure\" outcomes such as survival by toxicity are subject to bias due to the time-dependence of both the predictor and outcome variables. In addition, interpretation of even appropriately conducted statistical analyses is problematic, as with analyses of survival by outcome variables such as response. The use of statistical methodology designed to avoid such biases in these comparisons is shown and the problems in the interpretation of results are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-seven adult patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were treated in a phase I/II study combining continuous intravenous (IV) infusions of iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd) and hyperfractionated radiation therapy. IdUrd was administered as a continuous infusion (24 h/d) for two separate 14-day infusion periods. The dose of IdUrd was escalated from 500 to 1,200 mg/m2/d. The initial wide-field tumor volume was treated to 45 Gy at 1.5 Gy fractions twice daily over 3 weeks. Following a planned 2-week break, a reduced-field boost of 25 Gy was delivered using 1.25 Gy fractions twice daily over 2 weeks (total dose, 70 Gy over 9 weeks). The IdUrd infusion preceded both the wide-field and reduced-field irradiation by 1 week. All treatment was performed on an outpatient basis. Dose-limiting systemic toxicity to the bone marrow (primarily thrombocytopenia) and gastrointestinal (GI) tract (both stomatitis and diarrhea) established the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) at 1,000 mg/m2/d for a 14-day infusion. Significant local toxicity (within the radiation field) was not seen. The kinetics of IdUrd were linear with dose escalation and reached steady-state plasma concentrations of 1.3 to 3.4 mumol/L. The total body clearance of IdUrd was .82 L/min/m2. The primary metabolite, 5-iodouracil (IUra) approached steady state by day 6 of the infusion when plasma levels were 60 times higher than IdUrd. Plasma levels of uracil and thymine, but not thymidine, were elevated throughout the infusion. With a minimum follow-up of 1 year, ten patients remain alive, while 33 patients died of progressive disease, and four patients died of other causes (including one treatment-related death). The median survival for all 47 patient and for the 40 patients receiving the MTD was 45 and 47 weeks, respectively, with 12% and 14% survivals at 24 months. Using a Cox regression analysis, age (less than or equal to 50 years v greater than 50 years) and pretreatment performance status (PS) (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG]-PS 0 to 1 v PS 2 to 3) were independent, statistically significant (P2 less than .05) predictors of survival, with the ECOG status being a better predictor. Patients with a PS 0 to 1 (28 patients) had a median survival of 64 weeks with 21% survival at 24 months, compared with a median survival of 29 weeks and 0% survival at 12 months in the 19 patients with PS 2 to 3. The overall and subgroup survival data are at least comparable to other combined modality treatment approaches in patients with GBM.\r"

Based on preclinical information demonstrating that the phenothiazine calmodulin-inhibitor trifluoperazine can enhance retention and cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in resistant cells, a phase I/II trial of the combination was performed to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of trifluoperazine that could be administered with doxorubicin. Patients with intrinsic (no previous response) and acquired (previous response with relapse) doxorubicin resistance were eligible. Doxorubicin was administered as a 96-hour continuous infusion (60 mg/m2) on days 2 through 5. Trifluoperazine was administered in divided doses orally on days 1 through 6, with dose escalation from 20 to 100 mg/d. Thirty-six patients were evaluable. The MTD of trifluoperazine was 60 mg/d, with dose-limiting toxicity being extrapyramidal side effects. No alteration of doxorubicin toxicity was observed. Seven of the 36 patients responded (one complete response [CR], six partial responses [PR]), with seven of 21 patients having acquired resistance, and zero of 15 with intrinsic resistance demonstrating responses. Doxorubicin plasma levels were not affected by trifluoperazine, and the maximal trifluoperazine plasma levels achieved were 129.83 ng/mL. This trial demonstrates the combination of trifluoperazine and doxorubicin is well tolerated, and the schedule recommended for phase II trials is doxorubicin, 60 mg/m2 (continuous infusion) days 2 through 5, and trifluoperazine, 15 mg four times per day orally days 1 through 6. Continued investigation of this combination is indicated for patients with acquired doxorubicin resistance.\r"

  ".W": "In 1983, the newly implemented prospective payment system reduced the length of hospital stays, thereby curtailing many of the services that patients traditionally received. The Division of Nursing at Memorial Medical Center of Long Beach, California identified many patient needs that were no longer being addressed during the inhospital stay and began looking for a way for nurses to meet these needs on an outpatient basis. The result was the formation of Memorial Medical Center's Community Nursing Center.\r"

  ".W": "Span of control, the number of people reporting to a manager, is an important management concept. It determines the structure of an organization and has financial, human resource, and quality of care implications. In nursing, the first line manager fills one of the most critical roles in the administration of nursing services. For this manager to perform her responsibilities effectively, an optimal span of control is necessary. Span of control is influenced by a number of factors. By understanding these factors, we can influence them to optimize the span of control of the nurse manager.\r"
