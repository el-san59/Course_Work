Compared with 32 controls, all patients had increased BAL fluid levels (p less than .001), and nine of 12 had increased plasma levels (p less than .001) of this split product from the third complement component. Reduced total hemolytic activity (CH50) in serum was seen in five patients (p less than .01). As an indication of damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier, ten of the 12 ARDS patients had elevated albumin concentrations in BAL fluid (p less than .001). These signs of complement activation and lung tissue damage are not specific for ARDS. Thus, in 15 patients investigated preoperatively and postoperatively, we found that major surgery induced a significant increase of BAL fluid C3a (p less than .01) and plasma C3a (p less than .02), a significant reduction of CH50 (p less than .001), and a significant increase of BAL fluid albumin (p less than .02). Similar values of CH50 and plasma C3a were seen in ARDS and after surgery (p greater than .05). Of the 12 ARDS patients, eight had increased BAL fluid concentrations of C3a (p less than .001), and ten had increased BAL fluid levels of albumin (p less than .001) compared with the post-surgical patients. Measuring complement consumption in blood by these techniques is of limited value in ARDS due to the lack of specificity. BAL fluid albumin has a similar degree of sensitivity and specificity for ARDS as does BAL fluid C3a.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each received 300 ml of fresh-frozen plasma or 25% albumin with up to 500 ml of crystalloids, in addition to regular maintenance fluids; this treatment increased pulmonary wedge pressure (WP) by 3 to 4 mm Hg. Measurements were performed before and after approximately 5 h of volume loading. Because cardiac index (CI) decreased as WP increased in four septic and three nonseptic patients, we grouped the data according to the state of flow instead of the recording time sequence. From low to high flows, mean CI increased in septic patients and nonseptic patients. Oxygen delivery (Do2) increased in septic and nonseptic patients. Vo2 remained unchanged in nonseptic patients, while it increased in septic patients. Accordingly, arteriovenous oxygen difference narrowed in nonseptic patients from 4.46 +/- 1.62 to 3.59 +/- 1.21 ml/dl (p less than .05) but did not change in septic patients. In the septic group, the difference in CI between high and low flows was significantly (p less than .05) greater in survivors than in nonsurvivors. We conclude that the septic state is accompanied by a peripheral oxygen deficit, which can be partially reversed by maintaining an above-normal CI and Do2.\r"

Pulmonary vascular permeability was assessed by measuring 131I-albumin (RISA) concentration in extravascular, extracellular lung water (EVECW) relative to plasma (RISAL/RISAPL). EVECW (ml/g dry lung) was measured by 24Na, and total lung water (TLW) by wet/dry weight (g/g dry lung). Air-breathing control values were 4.53 +/- 0.25 (SD) for TLW and 0.40 +/- 0.09 for RISAL/RISAPL. In the air-breathing OA group, TLW and RISAL/RISAPL increased to 8.32 +/- 0.85 and 0.93 +/- 0.16, respectively, 2 h after OA (p less than .001) but by 24 h, were equal to air-breathing controls. TLW and RISAL/RISAPL in the oxygen treated OA group did not differ from the air breathing OA group on days 2 through 7 inclusive, suggesting that 80% oxygen had no effect on edema formation in the OA-injured lung. Breathing 80% oxygen alone, without OA injury, significantly (p less than .005) increased TLW and RISAL/RISAPL on days 5 and 6. Thus, preexisting lung injury had a protective effect against edema formation from a high fraction of inspired oxygen.\r"

This study population was independent of the group used to develop the models. The admission prediction model estimated each patient's probability of hospital mortality based on seven routinely collected admission variables. The 24-h model utilized seven variables routinely available at 24 h in the ICU. The admission model accurately described the mortality experience of the new cohort, while the 24-h model did not. Advantages of the admission model are that it is evaluable at the time of ICU admission, is independent of ICU treatment, and can be used to stratify patients by severity of illness, thereby making ICU comparisons possible. Its excellent goodness-of-fit, correct classification rate, sensitivity, and specificity suggest that this model is now ready for multihospital testing.\r"

Current criteria for removal from ECMO are limited. We attempted to determine whether lung compliance (CL) could be used as a sensitive indicator of the neonates' lung improvement while they are on ECMO, as well as a predictor of their ability to tolerate removal from bypass. We obtained serial CL measurements in 13 infants, all of whom weaned successfully from ECMO. All had an initial CL on ECMO of 0.5 ml/cm H2O X kg or less (mean = 0.3), with a final CL of 0.8 ml/cm H2O X kg or more (mean = 1.7). The average change in CL from the initial to the final measurement was 0.6 ml/cm H2O X kg or more (mean = 1.5). CL findings correlated well with estimated bypass, expressed as a percent of cardiac output, and a radiographic score of pulmonary abnormality (r = -.66, p less than .0001, and r = -.52, p less than .0001, respectively). We conclude that CL measurements can be used to monitor clinical improvement in infants on ECMO, to predict their successful removal from bypass, and ultimately to shorten their total time spent on bypass.\r"

Results showed no change in the extravascular lung water with HFV compared with the static lungs in normal, mild pulmonary edema, and severe pulmonary edema groups. We conclude that HFV has no appreciable effect on lung fluid balance; the lymphatic system retains its ability to increase flow even with experimentally produced pulmonary edema.\r"

Their overall mortality rate was 69% and was related to their age (32 +/- 14 yr in survivors and 54 +/- 15 yr in nonsurvivors; p less than .001) and to the number of complications during their illness (1.4 complications in survivors, 2.6 in nonsurvivors; p less than .005). The ARDS patients, due to an infectious etiology, incurred a 75% mortality rate, while those with a noninfectious etiology of ARDS had a 55% mortality rate (nonsignificant). Neither a simplified acute physiology score nor a respiratory failure severity index was significantly different between survivors and nonsurvivors on admission. The mean PEEP level on admission in survivors was 8.1 +/- 4.6 cm H2O and in nonsurvivors 3.7 +/- 3.9 cm H2O (p less than .025). We conclude that the age of the patients and superimposed multiple system organ failure are probably related with the still high mortality rate of this syndrome.\r"

During the training program, the sessions were gradually prolonged from 5 min to a maximum of 30 min, the IMV rate was gradually decreased, and the magnitude of the resistive load was gradually increased. After 45 days of training, his vital capacity had increased from 380 to 850 ml, his maximal inspiratory airway pressure from -28 to -50 cm H2O, and his tolerance of T-piece breathing, from less than 10 min to over 16 h. After an additional 2 wk of nocturnal mechanical ventilation, he was successfully weaned. We conclude that IRT with IMV can be an effective method of weaning patients who have severe ventilatory failure.\r"

The feasibility and potential value of transcutaneous diaphragm electromyography (tcEMG) was confirmed in a group of infants using two prototype respiratory EMG monitors. Infants were monitored continuously for periods ranging from hours to days. One hundred were monitored for clinical reasons, looking for disordered respiratory behavior, while 47 were studied for technical/experimental reasons. Reliable measurements of diaphragm EMG activity were obtained, provided fully shielded electrode cables were used. Measurements in 28 ventilated infants and one adult confirmed that, unlike impedance and other non-electrophysiologic measures, tcEMG monitoring is not contaminated by ventilator-induced respiratory movements. The potential value of tcEMG monitoring in ventilated subjects is exemplified by illustrations of: diaphragmatic inactivity from phrenic nerve injury, inadequate central drive, and neuromuscular block; augmented expiratory muscle activity; and progressive increase in inspiratory diaphragmatic activity in the presence of a tension pneumothorax. TcEMG monitoring should prove a worthwhile addition to the available noninvasive respiratory monitoring techniques.\r"

An alternate support mode is jet ventilation through an open, uncuffed endotracheal tube. To quantitate gas delivery and airway pressures (Paw) during bronchoscopy using this technique, we used a mechanical-lung model and 15 human subjects. Jet ventilation pulsed gases at 60 to 100 cycle/min through a catheter in an uncuffed, jet endotracheal tube with a 5.9-mm (OD) bronchoscope in place. Inspiratory time was constant at 33% of cycle time, and jet-drive pressures ranged from 5 to 30 psi. In the mechanical-lung model, the jet technique provided up to 30 L/min of ventilation with mean airway pressures (Paw) always less than 10 cm H2O. In contrast, VCV with an inflated cuff, while providing similar levels of ventilation, resulted in substantial air trapping and over twice the Paw. VCV with a deflated cuff provided much lower levels of ventilation, although Paw levels were also low. These delivered minute ventilations, and Paw levels were similar in six normal volunteers jet ventilated through a 9-mm jet endotracheal tube with a bronchoscope in place. Finally, in nine patients requiring mechanical ventilatory support during bronchoscopic procedures, this jet technique provided alveolar ventilation (i.e., PaCO2) and Paw levels comparable to those obtained on baseline VCV before bronchoscopy.\r"

Hypothermia occurred in 35 (32%) patients, of whom 20 (57%) suffered from hypokalemia. Hypothermia was accompanied by an undercompensated metabolic acidosis in 15 (75%) and hyperglycemia in 18 (89%), while nine (45%) patients had cardiac dysrhythmias. Urinary potassium excretion was lower in hypothermic patients and therefore cannot explain the finding of hypokalemia. Administration of NaHCO3, insulin, digitalis, and calcium in patients suffering from hypothermia must be done with caution because hypokalemia may coexist with low body temperature and predispose the patients to lethal dysrhythmias.\r"

Local CBF was measured using the hydrogen-gas clearance method. The administration of NC maintained CBF at the pre-arrest level during postischemia, thus preventing the hypoperfusion observed in the control group with no NC. However, in the controls, CBF, reduced at 180 min after re-circulation, was not improved by NC infusion. Consequently, administering NC immediately after re-establishment of circulation may help maintain CBF during the postresuscitation period.\r"

If no opportunistic organism was identified, the patient underwent further diagnostic investigations. In 18 patients receiving mechanical ventilatory support, the procedure was performed via the endotracheal tube. Twelve patients who were less severely ill underwent the procedure via the transnasal route. In 43 percent (13/30), opportunistic infections were diagnosed by DLL. Twelve had P carinii, one of whom had cytomegalovirus and another of whom had Herpes simplex viruses, and one with Toxoplasma gondii. Thus, the sensitivity for all opportunistic infections was 86 percent (12/14). The volume of fluid recovered averaged 93 percent of that instilled. There was no significant difference between prelavage and postlavage PaO2. In this group of patients, double lumen lavage obviated the need for more invasive and expensive procedures.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the possibility of predicting PaO2 during exercise of a given oxygen uptake (VO2) from resting pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The three-minute incremental treadmill exercise was performed with serial measurements of PaO2 via intra-arterial catheter in 46 patients (mean FEV1 = 1.09 +/- 0.49L, mean FEV1/FVC = 44 +/- 15 percent). In most of the patients, the changes of PaO2 were quite linear in relation to the oxygen uptake, so a slope (PaO2/VO2) could be obtained from the regression equation in each patient. The mean value of the slope (SL) was -23.0 +/- 16.6 mm Hg/L VO2/min. Correlation between SL and all parameters of resting PFTs were computed. Because of the high correlation coefficient between SL and %DCO (SL = -59.3 + 0.501 X %DCO, r = 0.851, p less than 0.001), it was possible to predict PaO2 at a given VO2 using the following equation: PaO2 predicted = PaO2 rest + SL X (VO2 -0.25), where SL was derived from measured %DCO and resting VO2 was assumed 0.25 L/min. There was a high correlation between the predicted PaO2 at VO2 of 1.0 L/min and the estimated PaO2 obtained from individual PaO2 regression with an r value = 0.898 and SEE = +/- 5.8 mm Hg. A prospective study in 12 patients with COPD was then carried out. There was a high correlation (r = 0.857) between the predicted PaO2 obtained from the present equation and the estimated PaO2 at VO2 = 1.0 L/min. It was concluded that PaO2 during treadmill walking with a given oxygen uptake is predictable from a resting PaO2 and a diffusing capacity. This predicted value may be useful in the management of patients with COPD.\r"

  ".W": "Because of suspicion that the ear oximeter might measure the oxyhemoglobin saturation of arterial blood inaccurately during heavy exercise, we made concurrent ear oximetric and blood measurements on 14 consecutive patients with arterial catheters during clinical exercise tests. After correcting for carboxyhemoglobin, the estimated and measured values for the oxyhemoglobin saturation of the blood agreed well, as did resting ear and blood values; however, during heavy exercise, ear oximetric values were falsely elevated in two patients with interstitial pulmonary disease and were falsely depressed in five patients with cardiovascular limitation to exercise. In another patient, ear oximetric values declined during heavy exercise despite mild hyperoxia, suggesting hypoperfusion of the ear. Considering the clinical and physiologic importance of oxyhemoglobin saturation, ear oximetric values during heavy exercise should be cautiously interpreted.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the levels of lysozyme in pleural fluid and serum in 141 patients with the following different causes for their pleural effusions: tuberculosis; neoplasias; transudates; parapneumonic, not complicated; empyemas; and miscellaneous. The lysozyme level of the pleural fluid and the ratio of that level over the serum level of lysozyme (PL/SL ratio) was meaningfully increased in patients with empyema (p less than 0.01). The groups with tuberculous and neoplastic effusions showed significant differences in the PL/SL ratio (p less than 0.01). The existence of a raised PL/SL ratio suggested important local synthesis of lysozyme, and it came up in empyemas and tuberculosis, unlike the other groups. Excluding the patients with empyemas, a PL/SL ratio of 1.2 showed a sensitivity of 100 percent, specificity of 94.9 percent, positive predictive value of 94.7 percent, negative predictive value of 100 percent, and accuracy of 97.3 percent for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion. All of this suggests that the determination of the lysozyme level can be an easy method of great usefulness in the initial diagnosis of pleural effusions.\r"

In 32 of the 36 patients, adequate Doppler signals were obtained in the pulmonary arterial trunk and correlated with right cardiac hemodynamics. The studied group included 26 patients with mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) greater than 20 mm Hg at rest (group A, with pulmonary hypertension) and six patients with MPAP of 20 mm Hg or less (group B, without pulmonary hypertension). A control group (group C) consisted of 12 subjects with normal hemodynamic data and pulmonary function. Analysis of Doppler data included flow velocity curve pattern, presence of a negative presystolic velocity, right ventricular pre-ejection period (RVPEP) and ejection period (RVEP), time between onset and peak of pulmonary velocity (time to peak velocity, TPV) and derived ratios of TPV/RVPEP and TPV/RVEP. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, the Doppler flow velocity curve in the pulmonary trunk showed a rapid acceleration and an early deceleration. The mean value for TPV was 78 +/- 12 msec in group A, 115 +/- 11 msec in group B, and 127 +/- 10 msec in group C. In patients with COPD, significant correlations were observed between TPV and log10 MPAP (r = -0.77; SEE = 0.07) and between TPV and log10 total pulmonary resistances (r = -0.84; SEE = 0.05). Accordingly, pulsed Doppler echocardiography may be a useful tool to predict pulmonary hypertension due to chronic pulmonary disease.\r"

The children received two puffs of aerosol from a MDI in each of two modalities tested each day on four different days (double blind). One modality contained albuterol aerosol and the other placebo. Pulmonary function was tested before and at 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after treatment. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) increased similarly after all four modes of administration. Six patients who had incorrect inhalation technique benefited from the three inhalation aids. The aerosol bag and InspirEase produced slightly greater bronchodilator response than the Aerochamber. The inhalation aids are useful devices for those who have incorrect inhalation technique, but those who have correct technique do not derive any benefit from these devices.\r"

Fourteen subjects with asthma requiring daily therapy with theophylline were evaluated in a 30-day prospective study. Pulmonary function and serum levels of theophylline were measured. With the twice-daily preparation the mean variation over 12 hours between the maximum concentration (Cmax) and minimum concentration (Cmin) for theophylline was 3.0 micrograms/ml +/- 0.3 microgram/ml, and there was no significant change in tests of pulmonary function. With the once-daily preparation the mean variation over twenty four hours between Cmax and Cmin was 7.4 micrograms/ml +/- 1.1 micrograms/ml, with a small but significant associated change in the forced expiratory volume in one second (84.1 vs 79.6 percent of predicted). Several of the subjects had large differences between Cmax and Cmin with the once-daily preparation. For some, Cmin was quite low while at the same time Cmax was high enough so that further increases in the dose of the once-daily preparation would not have been possible. Thus, consideration of the variation from Cmax to Cmin is necessary in adjusting a patient's dose of the once-daily preparation and may present problems in changeover from the twice-daily preparation if the mean blood level of theophylline is already high.\r"

Since therapeutic aerosols delivered by metered dose inhaler (MDI) are preferentially deposited in the mouth and pharynx, we wished to determine whether mouth rinsing and gargling with water might reduce the magnitude of such side effects by partially removing oral and pharyngeal drug residues. Serum glucose, insulin and potassium concentrations, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP) were measured as parameters of beta-adrenergic stimulation. Each of eight nonmedicated mild asthmatic patients was studied on two separate days after an overnight fast. Measurements were obtained twice before and then repeatedly at various times up to three hours after inhalation of ten albuterol doses (total dose approximately 1 mg) delivered by MDI. On either day the patient did, or did not, rinse the mouth and gargle after drug inhalation. Aerosol-administered albuterol significantly increased HR, FEV1, systolic BP and serum concentrations of glucose and insulin and lowered diastolic BP as early as five min after inhalation, indicating early systemic drug absorption. Peak changes in all measured parameters were observed within 30 min after treatment. Mouth rinsing and gargling removed 24 +/- 11 percent of the total albuterol dose delivered, but did not lower the magnitude or shift the time course of these side effects or bronchodilation. Our data suggest that cardiovascular and metabolic side effects are associated with the inhalation of an increased dose of albuterol and that mouth rinsing and gargling are not effective in reducing the magnitude of these systemic effects.\r"

Measurements were made before (BASELINE), during (ALM 15), at the end of (ALM 30), and at 30 minute intervals after (POSTALM 30, 60, 90, 120) the intravenous (IV) infusion of 0.5 mg/kg body weight of almitrine in 30 minutes. Almitrine produced an increase in PaO2 from 86 +/- 14 (BASELINE) to 129 +/- 69 (ALM 15) and 129 +/- 86 mm Hg (ALM 30). The PaO2 quickly declined after stopping the infusion. The P(A-a)O2 and QVA/QT decreased with almitrine administration. The Ppa and QT increased transiently at ALM 30. We conclude that IV almitrine improves gas exchange and may be useful in the management of ARF.\r"

The yield of parotid gland biopsy in patients with abnormal gallium parotid activity was only marginally higher (64.7 percent). Abnormal parotid gland uptake of gallium citrate was seen in 17 of these 19 patients (89.5 percent) and was always associated with abnormal lung or perihilar activity.

For ten subjects, there were matched, related control subjects who did not have a connective tissue disorder. Patients had lower values of FVC and TLC than the values expected for their standing heights (83 and 91 percent). However, when sitting height was used to calculate expected spirometric values, patients free of severe deformity of the thoracic cage did not have significant spirometric abnormalities (FVC 105 percent, FEV1 92 percent). However, patients with moderate-to-severe pectus excavatum or scoliosis (common features of the Marfan syndrome) had marked reductions in total lung capacity as well as in FVC and FEV1, suggesting a restrictive ventilatory defect. The abnormalities of pulmonary function often found in clinical laboratories can be explained in most cases by inappropriate use of standing height to calculate expected values, by thoracic cage deformity, or by both. We have found no evidence from standard tests of pulmonary function for a connective tissue defect of lung parenchyma that is of clinical importance in Marfan patients who lack chest wall deformity.\r"

Since patients treated with Fluosol-DA may be at risk of developing adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as a complication of the original disorder for which they were transfused, we examined central hemodynamics and gas exchange in anesthetized O2-ventilated dogs with oleic-acid induced pulmonary edema before and after transfusion with 400 ml of either PFC (n = 5) or whole blood (n = 5). Transfusion produced similar increases in cardiac output, pulmonary and systemic vascular pressures and intrapulmonary shunt in the two groups. Arterial O2 tension, however, fell from 209 +/- 117 to 172 +/- 81 mmHg in the blood transfused group but increased from 219 +/- 145 to 302 +/- 138 mmHg in the PFC group. Arterial O2 content, on the other hand, increased in the blood transfused group due to an increase in hematocrit, but fell with PFC because of hemodilution. This lower total arterial O2 content in the PFC group was, however, compensated for by more efficient O2 transport by the PFC in that the PFC arteriovenous O2 content difference accounted for 26 percent of the total arteriovenous O2 content difference, making it about four times as efficient as hemoglobin in tissue O2 delivery. Fluosol DA, 20 percent, is an effective volume expander in this model of hypoxemic respiratory failure, and it can transport significant amounts of O2 even in the presence of a substantial intrapulmonary shunt.\r"

  ".W": "The secretin provocation test for gastrinoma is based on the premise that secretin decreases or has no effect on serum gastrin in normal and duodenal ulcer subjects while inducing a paradoxical rise in gastrinoma. We reexamined the serum gastrin response to pharmacologic amounts of secretin in normal volunteers (N = 17) and unoperated duodenal ulcer patients (N = 10). GIH secretin caused significant early gastrin rises from baseline in both groups (P less than 0.05). The gastrin response curves after secretin were not significantly different between normal and ulcer subjects. Similar gastrin rises were seen when synthetic secretin was administered to normal subjects (N = 6). In normal volunteers, intravenous bolus saline (N = 10) or amino acid (L-cysteine, N = 8) caused no change in serum gastrin from baseline. The gastrin response curves to GIH secretin and saline were significantly different (P less than 0.05). Our findings suggest that the gastrin rise in gastrinoma patients after secretin is an exaggeration of the normal response and not paradoxical.\r"

A good agreement was observed for ascites (r = 0.75) and splenomegaly (r = 0.75). It was fair for jaundice (r = 0.65), Dupuytren's contracture (r = 0.65), and vascular spiders (r = 0.64). However, it was poor for white nails (r = 0.27) and hepatic consistency (r = 0.11). Agreement was better among senior physician's than junior physicians. In order to assess which signs contributed to differentiate the three groups of patients, a stepwise discriminant analysis was realized; it identified three variables: vascular spiders (P less than 0.001), splenomegaly (P less than 0.001), and abdominal wall collateral veins (P less than 0.01). These results suggest that studies based on physical findings must be cautiously considered.\r"

Five of the nine patients still had an increased serum amylase (range 54-118 units/liter, mean 78.4) 24 hr after endoscopy. When hyperamylasemia occurred, it always appeared in and was higher in the 2-hr sample. The increased serum amylase activity was due to a rise of S-type isoamylase. The cause of hyperamylasemia after gastrointestinal endoscopy is speculative but is probably due to an hypersalivation.\r"

Among 32 with Crohn's disease, only 2 (6.1%) produced methane, as well as 16 of 51 ulcerative colitis patients (31.4%) and 11 of 32 patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (34.4%). Breath methane is thus unusual in Crohn's disease. After bowel cleansing for colonoscopy or surgery, 15 of 18 methane producers became nonproducers, whereas after antibiotic treatment, 24 of 30 producers sustained their methane-producing status. After gentamycin and cephazolin therapy, methane production was abolished in three of eight patients. Slight spontaneous variations in methane production were also noticed with two of 23 control subjects, becoming nonproducers on restudy after 10-25 months. Thus gastrointestinal diseases, bowel cleansing and, to a much lesser degree, antibiotic therapy, affect methane production.\r"

Rats were gavaged with PEG 900 solution and urinary recovery of PEG 900 was measured for 6 hr in order to assess its absorption. Young rats, 5-15 weeks of age, absorbed 1-1.3% of administered PEG 900. In contrast, rats 35-102 weeks of age absorbed 1.8-2.4% of administered PEG 900 (P less than 0.05 vs younger animals). The increased absorption of PEG 900 with aging is due to changes in intestinal permeability since the total uptake (serosal appearance + tissue uptake) of PEG 900 by jejunum, ileum, and colonic everted sacs was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in older rats (100 weeks) than young rats (9 1/2 weeks), while urinary excretion of PEG 900 following intravenous injection was the same in the two age groups. These studies indicate that aging rats have diminished capacity to exclude larger size molecules from penetrating the intestinal mucosa. The diminished barrier functions of the small intestine with aging may allow antigenic or mutagenic compounds to reach the systemic circulation.\r"

We have previously shown in anesthesized animals that electrical vagal stimulation provokes simultaneous intraluminal release of serotonin (5-HT) and substance P (SP). The aim of this study was to investigate if a physiologic stimulus, a meal, releases 5-HT, SP, and gastrin (G) into the canine jejunum. In 10 dogs, chronic jejunal Thiry-Vella loops were perfused with saline (37 degrees C) before and after: a test meal; atropine, 0.2 mg/kg intravenously before the meal; atropine alone at the same dose; propanolol, 0.5 mg/kg intravenously before the meal; and propanolol alone at the same dose. Effluent perfusates and peripheral blood samples were assayed by radioimmunoassay for concentrations of 5-HT, SP, and G. Large amounts of all three humoral agents were found intraluminally during the interdigestive period. The meal resulted in increased circulating levels of 5-HT, SP, and G, while intraluminal concentrations of 5-HT and SP but not G increased following the meal. Both atropine and propanolol pretreatment significantly reduced this response, while alone, these drugs did not affect basal values. We postulate that 5-HT and SP released into the intestinal lumen in response to a meal act as local neurocrine/paracrine modulators. Their release mechanisms appear to be under both cholinergic and adrenergic control.\r"

  ".U": "87132816\r", 
  ".W": "The possible role of local motility in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcers was investigated in rats using cysteamine. Duodenal motor activity was measured as intraluminal pressure recordings by means of a balloon positioned in the proximal duodenum. Subcutaneous administration of cysteamine (100 mg/kg) produced two linear bandlike lesions in the proximal duodenum within 6 hr. This dose of cysteamine significantly increased gastric acid secretion in acute fistula rats, and decreased duodenal HCO3- secretion caused by acid. During this period, this agent inhibited gastric motility but did produce markedly enhanced contractions in the duodenum. The changes in duodenal motility appeared within 5-10 min and were dose-dependent for cysteamine (10-100 mg/kg). Pretreatment with subcutaneously administered atropine (10 mg/kg), 16,16-dmPGE2 (30 micrograms/kg) or dopamine (10 or 30 mg/kg) significantly reduced the development of duodenal lesions caused by cysteamine, the inhibition being 86.8%, 49.7%, 54.5% or 67.8%, respectively. In the presence of cysteamine, dopamine had minimal effect on both acid and HCO3- secretion, while atropine or 16,16-dmPGE2 markedly inhibited acid secretion or increased HCO3- secretion, respectively. The enhanced duodenal motility induced by cysteamine was blocked partially by atropine and only slightly by 16,16-dmPGE2. Dopamine showed a dose-dependent inhibition on the duodenal hypermotility following cysteamine, and at 30 mg/kg almost completely abolished the development of contractions. These results suggest that abnormal hypermotility in the duodenum may be partly involved in the pathogenesis of cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcers.\r"

  ".W": "The levels of pancreatic digestive enzymes, lysosomal hydrolases, and protease inhibitors were evaluated in ascites fluid from 24 patients with acute pancreatitis diagnosed as alcoholic, gallstone-induced, or idiopathic. In this group the concentrations of amylase (354 +/- 98 ng/ml), immunoreactive cationic trypsinogen (1840 +/- 238 ng/ml), and immunoreactive elastase 2 (1492 +/- 262 ng/ml) were greatly elevated in comparison to the corresponding serum values. Enzyme levels in ascites from the idiopathic pancreatitis group tended to be higher than the levels from the other two groups. Activity of acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase was significantly higher in ascites compared to serum in all groups. On the other hand, levels of immunoreactive alpha 1-protease inhibitor and alpha 2-macroglobulin in ascites fluid were about half the average concentrations reported for normal serum. Significant amounts of tryptic amidase activity (61.7 +/- 13.7 micrograms/ml) were observed, indicating a trypsin-alpha 2-macroglobulin complex. These data indicate an imbalance in the protease-to-inhibitor ratio in ascites fluid from patients with acute pancreatitis. Coupled with elevated ribonuclease activity (27.4 +/- 3.4 units), a positive methemalbumin test in 23 of 24 patients (1.1 +/- 0.4 mg hematin/100 ml), and an average protein concentration of 4.0 +/- 0.2 g/100 ml, these observations demonstrate that abdominal paracentesis and the biochemical analyses of ascites fluid provide useful information related to the biochemical events in acute pancreatitis and may be useful in the diagnosis of difficult cases, but their predictive value of severity remains to be established.\r"

Data regarding the dialyzability of indomethacin in these patients, however, is lacking. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate (1) the dialyzability, and (2) the absorption and elimination kinetics of indomethacin, using six stable anephric adult patients who were maintained on chronic hemodialysis and were receiving indomethacin for the management of their uremic pericarditis. The results from this study demonstrate that indomethacin is dialyzable, but not to an appreciable extent. The mean predialysis and postdialysis indomethacin plasma levels were 3.4 and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The mean total amount of indomethacin removed by five hours of hemodialysis was 19.6 percent of the single dose of indomethacin 100 mg po. However, mean Cpmax, tmax, t1/2, and AUC0-infinity during and in the absence of hemodialysis were 5.4 and 5.4 micrograms/ml (not statistically significant [NS]), 1.9 and 2.0 h (NS), 6.1 and 5.3 h (NS), and 30.9 and 35.7 micrograms h ml-1 (NS), respectively. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that although indomethacin is dialyzable, no dosage adjustment is required in patients receiving indomethacin for the management of their uremic pericarditis when undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.\r"

  ".W": "The stability and compatibility of clindamycin phosphate with three aminoglycosides, amikacin sulfate, tobramycin sulfate, and gentamicin sulfate, admixed in either glass bottles or plastic bags, were studied under various storage conditions. In addition to the various two-drug combinations, each antibiotic was studied alone in the same solutions under the same storage conditions investigated for the various combinations. Clindamycin phosphate was admixed with amikacin sulfate in 100 ml glass bottles of both dextrose 5% in water (D5W) and NaCl 0.9%. The resultant solutions were examined for visual clarity; both pH and antibiotic concentrations were measured at the time of mixing and at 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours later. The solutions were maintained at room temperature under ambient lighting conditions throughout the observation period. Clindamycin phosphate was also admixed with tobramycin sulfate and gentamicin sulfate, in separate experiments, in 50 ml plastic bags of D5W and NaCl 0.9%. These solutions were examined, at the time of mixing, for visual clarity, pH, and antibiotic concentration and then frozen at -20 degrees C. They were thawed 14 and 28 days later and reexamined. Clindamycin phosphate concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography; those of the aminoglycosides were determined by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. A working definition of significant instability or incompatibility was defined as a greater than 10 percent loss of original antibiotic concentration. All single antibiotic solutions were stable throughout the observation periods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-nine patients were studied in part 1 of the trial to determine whether their APTT values were elevated when their prothrombin time (PT) was within 1.5 to 2.5 times the control PT. Part 2 was carried out using the data of 32 patients to determine whether a correlation existed between the degree of elevation of the patients' PT values due to warfarin and the concurrent degree of elevation of their APTT results. Baseline PT and APTT values and a minimum of three concurrent PT and APTT values determined during anticoagulation therapy with warfarin were used. Data were collected by chart review and review of Hematology Department records. Results indicated that a statistically significant difference was evident between the baseline APTT (30.79 sec) and the mean APTT (55.10 sec) when the PT was within the therapeutic range of 1.5 to 2.5 times the control while on warfarin therapy. Good linear correlation was evident (r = 0.821) between the degree of elevation of the PT and the degree of elevation of the APTT for the group. In most cases, a good linear correlation was also evident for individual patients. Routine ordering of concurrent APTT and PT tests for patients receiving warfarin therapy is not needed since the PT alone can be monitored under most circumstances.\r"

A retrospective review was conducted of the medical records of 79 terminal cancer patients who received a total of 84 intravenous morphine infusions. Data were recorded on morphine dosage, pain control, adverse effects, duration of infusion, and concomitant medication requirements. Infusion duration varied from less than 24 hours to 162 days (median: 7 days). Morphine dosage ranged from 0.5 to 300 mg/h. All patients experienced an improvement in baseline pain control; however, 54 percent required additional medication to enhance analgesia. Serious adverse effects, including marked sedation, hallucinations, diaphoresis, and respiratory depression, were recorded in 14 patients. These effects may be a reason for reducing the dose. Guidelines for the use of continuous intravenous morphine infusions are presented. Accurate pain assessment, morphine dosage calculation, and monitoring of adverse effects are essential to insure the safe and effective use of these infusions.\r"

Because longer dosing intervals require fewer daily doses, potential exists for overall cost reduction if pharmacy and nursing time can be effectively saved. Reduction in personnel costs, however, must be sufficient for these more expensive products to be truly cost effective. We studied the impact of substituting these newer agents for older, less expensive products with formulary status at our 200-bed community hospital. Results show that no nursing expenses could be recovered, and there is little chance of consistently reducing pharmacy compounding expenses. Within the constraints of these studies, particularly physician prescribing habits, the GRASP (Grace Reynolds Application and Study of PETO) system of determining nurse staffing, and our drug acquisition costs, we find that the newer extended half-life products have very limited usefulness and may only increase the cost of antibiotic utilization.\r"

The two reference texts most frequently found in community pharmacists' libraries were Compendium of Pharmaceutical Specialties and Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, the latter being available to only 49 percent of the pharmacists. More than 60 percent of the hospital pharmacists had at least 10 of the reference texts listed on our survey instrument. The majority of pharmacists were actively involved in a variety of clinical pharmacy services. Providing drug information to consumers or health professionals was one of the most common activities. Several pharmacists expressed their needs for drug information center (DIC) support in different drug information categories. Information on drug interactions and adverse drug reactions was rated as an important need by 68 and 59.9 percent of the community pharmacists, respectively. The institution of a regional DIC may provide the support system needed by the pharmacists of Quebec.\r"

Both academia and the pharmaceutical industry have opened their doors and allowed clinical pharmacists to spend a year or more developing clinical research skills and an understanding of the drug development process. Is it worth it? Is this program a benefit to the individuals, to the sponsors, or to the profession of pharmacy? The survey of these fellows provides us with the individual's perspective on the benefit and quality of the fellowship. Most believed the fellowship provided them with training to meet their needs and interests. However, given this small number of individual opinions and comments, how do we determine whether the fellowship is meeting the original goal to train clinical pharmacists to be clinical researchers? By looking at the career paths of those who have completed the program, we may gain insight into whether the fellows are involved with research. Since the fellowship has been in existence for only six years, we really can look only at the initial placement of these clinical pharmacists. A majority have gained employment with clinical research responsibilities within the pharmaceutical industry. One measure of the research capabilities of these fellows is their contributions to the scientific literature; 10 papers and 3 abstracts have been generated by fellows since they completed their fellowships (Appendix I). As expected, the research contributions of the two-year fellows are greater than that of the one-year fellows. Seven one-year fellows did not have a publication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A viable discipline requires the generation of new information. Clinical pharmacists have recognized that their success depends on their ability to contribute to (Table: see text) the expansion of the body of knowledge of their discipline. They have developed practice and research programs in a variety of areas. One of the results of these programs is the publication of articles in a variety of pharmacy and medical journals. Clinical pharmacists with specialty interests publish in journals that represent those interests. In comparing the type of clinical pharmacists' publications in the area of drug development, it is also clear that they are most suited for research in the clinical phase; that is, clinical pharmacists conduct research on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety and efficacy of new and old drugs. Clinical pharmacists tend to be members of research teams but bring a unique perspective to the team. In their collaboration with physicians, basic scientists, and other health-care personnel, clinical pharmacists are often cited as first author. Their research is important to researchers with similar specialty interests, regardless of whether they are pharmacists. Data retrieval has developed so that researchers with similar interests can identify key publications wherever they are published. Articles published by clinical pharmacists in pharmacy journals are quoted by other researchers. Therefore, I conclude that a number of clinical pharmacists are active in drug research and development. Many of these pharmacists were trained as practitioners, but have developed into researchers through trial and error and hard work.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The plasma to CSF ratios of HVA and PRL levels were significantly higher in the patient group. This shift may be due to an influence of the drugs on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability.

They had received the usual doses of phenobarbitone and diphenylhydantoin (PHT) regularly for 3-32 years, with control of seizures, and had not taken any B-vitamins in the year before investigation. Besides reduced serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) folate levels, significantly increased levels of total vitamin B6 in CSF and serum and of vitamin B12 in serum were found in patients as compared with normal healthy subjects. The bone marrow was normoblastic, and significant elevation of serum triglycerides and/or cholesterol was observed in patients. The total protein level was only slightly reduced as compared with that of controls, but there was significant increase in beta-lipoprotein fraction on gel electrophoresis. Plasma proteins concerned with vitamins and lipid transport showed no remarkable change, and no abnormal protein was detected. Although there was no clinical hepatic involvement, liver biopsy performed in 9 of 27 patients revealed fine structural changes in hepatocytes suggestive of varying degrees of drug-induced changes. A ramifying network of short, smooth, endoplasmic cisternae with depleted rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), distended sinusoids with Kupffer cells, dark shrunken hepatocytes with reduced mitochondria, and increased lipofuscin were observed. This suggested an adaptive response of the liver, a reversible change, possibly related to the increased serum lipids in the same patients.\r"

A steady state of one or two different PHT serum levels per rabbit was produced with intravenous (i.v.) injections of loading and infusion doses. A train of focal and generalized seizure discharges (SDs) induced by electrical stimulation was compared before and after dosing with PHT. The results showed that PHT levels of 10-40 micrograms/ml induce inhibitory effects, shortening the duration of neocortical focal SDs. The inhibitory effects paralleled the PHT levels and were proportionally related to epileptogenicity in individual neocortical areas. At serum levels under approximately 5-10 micrograms/ml, the spread of secondarily generalized SDs originating from neocortical focal SDs was suppressed more than the shortening of the duration of the primary focus. On the other hand, PHT showed no effects or only slight inhibitory effects on hippocampal SDs, and the SDs spread from them even at levels of 15-40 micrograms/ml. Electroshock (ES)-induced generalized SDs were slightly suppressed in duration at levels of 20-30 micrograms/ml. Moreover, both the focal and the generalized SDs were greatly prolonged at high serum levels (greater than 40 micrograms/ml), although such facilitative effects were rare. The clinical contributions of these results to PHT treatment in human epilepsy are discussed.\r"

The energy metabolites glycogen, glucose, ATP, and phosphocreatine were measured in five layers of the cerebral cortex and three layers of the cerebellum. Results showed that, as compared with controls, seizing animals had decreased energy metabolites selective to certain layers. Glucose was decreased in all cortical layers, but only in the granular layer of the cerebellum. Phosphocreatine was decreased in the outer small pyramidal layer and the polymorphous layer of the cortex but was unchanged in the cerebellum. ATP was decreased only in the outer small polymorphous layer of the cortex. These changes are consistent with the concept that selective changes may occur during seizures and that these changes are localized to layers that contain pyramidal cells. Examination of whole cortex may mask more subtle regional changes.\r"

Approximately three quarters of newly diagnosed patients can enter prolonged remission on currently available medication. The first 2 years of treatment are crucial in determining the subsequent course of epilepsy. The longer seizures continue, the less likely they are to be controlled. Factors that contribute to the evolution of chronic epilepsy are the presence of brain lesions, neuropsychiatric handicaps, and poor compliance. Early effective treatment may also be important in preventing the evolution of chronic epilepsy. Recent studies have not revealed any significant differences in efficacy between the major antiepileptic drugs, and the choice of drug will therefore be influenced by costs and side effects, especially cognitive and behavioral effects. The majority of patients with a single unprovoked tonic-clonic seizure go on to develop epilepsy. Studies are required to evaluate the need for and outcome of therapy in such patients. Information about the natural history of untreated epilepsy, and also the possible influence of drug therapy on the prospects for spontaneous remission, is lacking.\r"

Uterine flushings (UFs), PF, and blood were obtained during the follicular and luteal phases of the cycle from 29 normal women and 16 women who were diagnosed as having endometriosis. Protein content in UF did not change significantly throughout the cycle in either group. However, PF protein in patients with endometriosis was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher than in controls during the luteal phase. Total UF P was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced in women with endometriosis during the late luteal phase. During the early luteal phase, trypsin inhibitory activity in UF from normal women was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher than at any other phase of the cycle, whereas inhibitory activity in UF from patients with endometriosis remained relatively constant. Patients with endometriosis had significantly (P less than 0.05) higher total activity in PF during the early luteal phase than did controls. These results indicate that women suffering from endometriosis have significantly lower levels of P and less protease inhibitor within their uterine cavity during the luteal phase of the cycle, and significantly higher concentrations of protein and protease inhibitor in PF during the luteal phase.\r"

Tubal extraction was accomplished by one of the suprapubic punctures with the use of a polyp forceps. No complications have been encountered during the operation. However, because of severe pelvic adhesions or a voluminous hematocele, laparotomy was used in two cases (2%). The only postoperative complication was a deep vein thrombosis in one of the patients.

  ".W": "This study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of various methods in predicting and detecting ovulation in 14 spontaneous and 17 clomiphene citrate (CC)-induced cycles. From cycle day 11 all subjects (n = 27) were followed with daily transvaginal ultrasound; rapid measurement of serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol (E2); determination of urinary LH with First Response (Tambrands Inc., Palmer, MA) and Ovustick (Monoclonal Antibodies, Inc., Mountain View, CA) kits; and recording of basal body temperature (BBT). The results demonstrated that transvaginal ultrasound detected ovulation in all cycles. Mean daily serum LH levels were similar in both groups, and peak values of 40 mIU/ml or greater preceded the day of ovulation in all cycles. Serum E2 peak was significantly greater in CC cycles (961 +/- 96 versus 463 +/- 39 pg/ml) (P less than 0.01) and preceded the LH peak in 97% of the cycles. First Response and Ovustick predicted ovulation in 53.3% and 87.5% of the cycles, respectively (P less than 0.01). BBT nadir predicted the day of ovulation in only 10% of cycles. In conclusion, this study revealed that transvaginal ultrasound is an excellent method for detection of ovulation and that Ovustick is a very useful method for prediction of the day of ovulation.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which the intrauterine device (IUD) prevents clinical pregnancy has not been established. The possibility that the IUD works primarily at the time of implantation or beyond has raised legal and ethical concerns. Numerous studies have measured human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) among IUD users as a way to determine whether implantation routinely occurs in the presence of an IUD. Both positive and negative findings have been reported, reflecting major difficulties in the measurement of hCG at low levels. In this study, we collected daily urine specimens for up to three menstrual cycles from 40 women who used nonmedicated IUDs. We assayed these urines with an immunoradiometric assay that is highly specific for hCG at very low concentrations. This assay allows us to describe patterns of hCG rise and fall that would be undetectable by standard radioimmunoassays. In this study of IUD users, we found only one incident of probable early pregnancy loss among 107 cycles. With the use of an assay sensitive to hCG at levels as low as physiologic background, the possibility of frequent unrecognized implantation among IUD users can be reasonably excluded.\r"

Ovarian function was disturbed, as witnessed by low estradiol, high total testosterone (T) levels with normal free T, and mildly elevated androstenedione. An interference of ovarian follicular aromatase activity possibly due to copper intoxication could explain these findings as the cause of the ovulatory disturbances of Wilson's disease.\r"

Peritoneal or tubal fluid cytologic features and biopsies of fallopian tubes or adhesions were also studied after each laparoscopy. The serum of each woman was titrated for evidence of C. trachomatis infection. The sera of a control group of 51 women with ovarian infertility but normal fallopian tubes according to laparoscopy and hysterosalpingogram were titrated in an identical manner. The current study confirms previous studies that showed a strong correlation between infertility due to fallopian tube factors and positive C. trachomatis cultures or serologic studies. The current study suggests that C. trachomatis infection does not correlate with a past history of salpingitis or pelvic pain, but that current C. trachomatis infection, as assessed by positive culture, does correlate with gross and histologic evidence of chronic inflammation.\r"

The patient completed prospective self-rating scales for two consecutive cycles to establish the pattern and severity of PMS. On day 26 of the first cycle when PMS symptom scores were elevated, continuous monitoring of skin resistance and finger temperature and frequent blood sampling for LH were performed for 8 hours. The patient experienced five flush episodes, each of which was associated with a drop in skin resistance of up to 4000 ohms and was coincident with an LH pulse. Three of the flushes were associated with a rise in finger temperature of up to 10 degrees C. These physiologic changes are identical to those seen during menopausal flushes and suggest that PMS may be associated with neuroendocrine events typical of E withdrawal.\r"

Three patients undergoing sterilization by partial salpingectomy were studied as controls. Chlamydial IgG and IgM antibody titers were performed on serum samples. No microbiologic or serologic evidence for active infection by known pathogens was found. In three of the study patients mild oviductal mural fibrosis was present. However, in two other study patients chronic salpingitis with phagocytosis of cilia by luminal macrophages was demonstrated. It is suggested that if this active process persists after tubal reanastomosis, it may result in impaired oviductal function.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-nine children, aged 1-15 yr, with newly diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) had sera taken before insulin therapy to be examined for the presence of insulin-receptor antibodies by measuring the inhibition of binding of radiolabeled insulin to IM-9 lymphocytes in both whole serum and purified IgG fractions. Groups of children with long-standing IDDM and autoimmune endocrine disease as well as a normal control group were studied. A positive result, defined as binding greater than or equal to 2 SD below the mean zero standard, was found in 3 (10.3%) of the 29 newly diagnosed diabetic patients. As a group, they showed significantly greater binding inhibition than the normal control group for both whole serum and purified IgG (one-tailed t test, P less than .05 and P less than .002, respectively). Insulin autoantibodies were also measured by a sensitive radioimmunoassay technique. A positive result, defined as binding greater than 3 SD above the normal control pooled sera, was found in 9 (37.5%) of 24 of the newly diagnosed IDDM group tested. All 3 subjects positive for insulin-receptor antibodies were also positive for insulin autoantibodies, whereas 6 of the 21 receptor-antibody-negative subjects were positive for insulin autoantibodies (Fisher's exact test, P = .0415). This suggests the possibility that the presence of insulin autoantibodies is a prerequisite for the development of insulin-receptor antibodies, i.e., as an anti-idiotypic response. Insulin-receptor antibodies and insulin autoantibodies may play a currently undefined pathophysiologic role in the development of IDDM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is believed to be rate limiting in the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, LPL activity has not correlated with plasma triglyceride concentrations in experimental rat diabetes. To gather more information about this enzyme system in diabetes, LPL activities were measured in representative tissues from control and streptozocin-induced diabetic rats fed fat-free chow and in 48-h-starved animals. The DNA content of each tissue was determined so that LPL activity could be expressed in a way that was unaffected by tissue wasting. Diabetic animals lost approximately 20% of their body mass. Adipose tissue and soleus muscle cell masses were reduced, and there was marked fat atrophy at necropsy. Adipose tissue LPL was decreased in both starved and diabetic animals, whereas skeletal muscle activities were variably affected. Lipase content and distribution among the individual organs were calculated with published data for rat carcass composition. In diabetic rats, total LPL (adipose tissue, muscle, and parenchymal organs) was reduced by nearly two-thirds so that skeletal muscle became the predominant source of LPL. Ketonuria was less frequent in diabetic than in starved rats (P less than .018) despite their severe wasting. Serum triglyceride concentrations were higher in ketonuric than nonketonuric diabetic animals, and severe hypertriglyceridemia was seen exclusively in heavily ketonuric animals. These observations together with published information suggest that plasma triglyceride concentrations in the rat model are determined by a complex interplay between very-low-density lipoprotein synthesis, the capacity of the LPL removal system, properties of the lipoprotein substrate, and other unidentified factors.\r"

Serum was incubated with phenytoin to yield concentrations of 15 and 25 mg/L, and a serum ultrafiltrate was prepared from an aliquot of each sample. We observed a linear correlation between glycosylated albumin and the free fraction of phenytoin at serum phenytoin concentrations of 15 mg/L (r = .35, P = .03) and 25 mg/L (r = .40, P = .003). A better correlation existed between the free fraction of phenytoin and total albumin concentrations for both serum concentrations (r = .45, P = .005 for 15 mg/L; r = .56, P = 10-5) for 25 mg/L), whereas the best linear correlation resided between the free fraction of phenytoin and the concentration of nonglycosylated albumin (r = .54, P = .0005 for 15 mg/L; r = .63, P less than 10(-6) for 25 mg/L). There was no correlation between the free fraction of phenytoin and the concentration of glycosylated albumin. Incubation of solutions of glycosylated and nonglycosylated albumin demonstrated significantly lower binding to the glycosylated fraction (P = 8.1 X 10(-6)). These results indicate that glycosylation of albumin diminishes the affinity of the phenytoin binding site on albumin. This alteration may have clinical significance in that it may alter the disposition of phenytoin in patients with IDDM and produce free phenytoin serum concentrations that are not accurately reflected by total serum phenytoin concentrations.\r"

Responsive elevations in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine and in growth hormone, glucagon, and cortisol were not significantly affected by a ninefold change in the rate at which plasma glucose was lowered from 83 +/- 1 to 50 +/- 1 mg/dl in normal subjects. Similarly, wide variation in the rate of fall produced no substantive differences in counterregulatory hormone responses to hypoglycemia in diabetic subjects. The plasma glucose threshold at which epinephrine release began, determined from the slow-fall studies, was 63 +/- 3 mg/dl in normal subjects but exhibited a wide range (48-74 mg/dl). Similar values were found in the diabetics. Thresholds for growth hormone, cortisol, and glucagon were slightly lower, ranging from 45 to 68 mg/dl in the normals. Our data suggest that counterregulatory hormone responses to hypoglycemia are triggered by the glucose level per se and not by its rate of fall. Furthermore, individual differences in glucose thresholds for epinephrine release may contribute to variations in the glucose level associated with hypoglycemic symptoms.\r"

This survey included a demographic/medical history questionnaire administered in the participant's home and a detailed examination composed of a physician's exam, special clinical procedures, other tests, and collection of blood and urine specimens. Survey participants were selected from 1970 census data through a stratified multistage probability sampling scheme. Of 17,390 eligible residents aged 20-74 yr, 15,357 (88.3%) participated in the interview and are the basis for estimates of diagnosed diabetes; 11,858 (68%) participated in the exam. A half sample of 5901 examinees was selected to receive a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) performed in the morning after an overnight 10- to 16-h fast. Of these examinees, valid OGTT data were obtained for 3772 people without a medical history of diabetes, and these are the basis for estimates of undiagnosed diabetes and IGT. The major reasons for incomplete OGTT data were inability of participants to attend the examination center in the morning and lack of adherence to the fasting instructions. Despite the relatively low response rates, evidence is presented that data on both the interviewed sample and those receiving the OGTT, when adjusted for the 1970-1980 census characteristics by age, race, sex, income, and geographic location, are representative of the U.S. population. Extrapolation of these data to the U.S. population aged 20-74 yr indicates a total diabetes prevalence of 6.6% by NDDG criteria, or more than 8 million people with diabetes. The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes (3.2%) was almost equal to that of previously diagnosed diabetes (3.4%). Total rates of diabetes increased with age, from 2.0% at age 20-44 yr to 17.7% at age 65-74 yr. Rates were approximately equal by sex but were greater in Blacks than in Whites. The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes by WHO criteria (3.4%) was similar to that by NDDG criteria, but the rate of impaired glucose tolerance (11.2%) was more than twice the NDDG estimate (4.6%). Both obesity and parental history of diabetes were associated with significantly higher rates of diabetes and IGT. Fasting plasma glucose was relatively insensitive to age, but 1-h and 2-h post-75-g glucose values increased significantly with age.\r"

Esophageal emptying was also markedly delayed in patients, with 15 of 16 patients having an emptying time longer than the normal range. There was no relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms, or the severity of the peripheral (skeletal) muscle weakness, and either gastric or esophageal emptying. Oral administration of metoclopramide resulted in a significant improvement in gastric emptying of the solid meal and a nonsignificant trend toward more rapid liquid emptying, but no change in esophageal emptying. These results indicate that there is a very high prevalence of gastric and esophageal smooth muscle dysfunction in dystrophia myotonica and that gastroparesis is likely to be a treatable cause of morbidity in this disease.\r"

Cholecystokinin was determined in pooled and in individual plasma samples after separation of cholecystokinin and gastrin by high-performance liquid chromatography. Gastrin and somatostatin levels were significantly increased during the 8-wk-long dog pregnancy; peak values were recorded in week 7 and week 4, respectively. The cholecystokinin level rose and peaked at week 3, and remained elevated. In response to suckling, maternal gastrin levels rose significantly when tested in week 1 and 3 of lactation. Somatostatin levels did not respond significantly to suckling, but basal levels were elevated in week 1 compared to week 3 of lactation. Cholecystokinin rose in response to suckling both in week 1 and 3 of lactation. We suggest that the increased levels of gastrointestinal hormones during pregnancy and lactation may serve to increase digestive and anabolic capacity.\r"

  ".U": "87134836\r", 
  ".W": "We studied the mechanisms of initiation and pathways for the propagation of intestino-intestinal inhibitory reflexes induced by close intraarterial injections of neostigmine in conscious dogs. Two or three T-shaped catheters were surgically implanted in the intestinal branches of the superior mesenteric artery to inject pharmacologic agents locally in 10-15-cm-long segments. Migrating myoelectric complexes were recorded by a set of 10 electrodes and strain-gauge transducers. Close intraarterial injection of neostigmine initiated strong contractions of long duration in the perfused segment that terminated phase III activity in progress 90-150 cm distal or proximal to the cannulated sites and stopped its further migration. Atropine or 4-diphenylmethoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide injected just before neostigmine administration through the same catheter blocked both the local contractile effects and the reflex inhibition of phase III activity. Pirenzepine or hexamethonium injected in a similar manner did not affect the local response to neostigmine but blocked the reflex inhibition of phase III activity. A transection and reanastomosis in the mid-small intestine blocked the reflex inhibition by close intraarterial injection of neostigmine beyond the transection site. Pirenzepine, atropine, or hexamethonium injected through a middle catheter also blocked the reflex inhibition of phase III activity beyond the site perfused with these cholinergic antagonists. Close intraarterial administration of 4-diphenylmethoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide at a middle site had no effect on reflex inhibition. We concluded that strong spasmodic contractions in the small intestine initiate an intestino-intestinal inhibitory reflex in both directions. This reflex is mediated through an intrinsic neural pathway involving nicotinic and M1 muscarinic receptors.\r"

Sixteen asymptomatic middle-aged men who had had partial gastrectomy with Billroth II anastomosis but no other risk factors for metabolic bone disease were compared with unoperated healthy controls. Studies included a dietary survey, biochemical tests of bone and mineral metabolism, radiographs of the spine, determinations of bone mineral content, and bone histomorphometry. The gastric surgery subjects exhibited frequent vertebral fractures and an unusual constellation of bone abnormalities characterized by decreased bone mineral content and hyperosteoidosis without evidence of osteomalacia. Although serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not different, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly higher (p = 0.037), and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly lower (p less than 0.0001) in subjects than in controls. Partial gastrectomy with Billroth II anastomosis may be associated with asymptomatic but clinically important metabolic bone disease. The pathophysiology is uncertain, but appears to involve alterations in vitamin D metabolism.\r"

Using serum from guinea pigs fed with milk proteins we examined the passive transfer of sensitivity to beta-lactoglobulin. Biophysical methods were used to measure electrogenic chloride secretion across colonic epithelia. This response has been shown previously to be the cellular function that is altered after antigen challenge. Affinity column chromatography was used to separate immune serum into immunoglobulin G-(IgG)-rich and immunoglobulin G-depleted fractions and the purity of these fractions was established. Passive transfer of sensitivity was possible with the immunoglobulin G-rich, but not the immunoglobulin G-depleted, fraction. We have proven, therefore, that the reaction is mediated, at least in part, by immunoglobulins of the G class. This finding may have implications for the study of phenomena of food allergy.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was performed to characterize the interaction between two closely timed swallows, with particular attention being paid to short swallow intervals (less than 6-8 s) when the first wave is still traversing the esophagus and the effect of afferent stimulation in the form of bolus size. The contractile response of the esophagus to paired swallows (2-8 ml) over a range of swallow intervals (1.5-20 s) was studied in 13 normal humans using a 7-lumen perfused manometry catheter. At the shortest swallow intervals (less than 4 s), the first swallow wave is arrested in the striated muscle, while the second progresses normally. As swallow intervals lengthen (3-8 s), the first wave is arrested in the striated muscle, or is arrested or attenuated in the smooth muscle esophagus, but can continue for up to 3 s after initiation of the second swallow. The second wave is then arrested in the striated muscle, while beyond, a rapid or nonperistaltic low-amplitude wave occurs 3-5 s after the second swallow. At longer swallow intervals (greater than 6-8 s), the nonperistaltic second wave is replaced abruptly by a low-amplitude peristaltic wave of low velocity that traverses the entire esophagus. A larger first bolus increases the swallow interval required for this abrupt change, whereas a larger second bolus shortens the interval. The larger second bolus also increases the amplitude and decreases the velocity of the peristaltic second wave in both striated and smooth muscle portions. At swallow intervals greater than 10-15 s, two normal peristaltic waves occur. These studies demonstrate that each swallow of a closely timed pair directly affects the other. Not only does the second wave inhibit the first, but the first swallow and its wave markedly affect the second swallow wave. These interactions involve both the striated and the smooth muscle esophagus, and the latter interaction in particular is highly sensitive to afferent stimulation. This suggests that the interactions are predominantly neurogenic and have a significant central neural component.\r"

Ten were restudied after a month of sobriety. The mean lower esophageal sphincter pressure and esophageal contraction amplitude in alcoholics were significantly higher than controls. Radionuclide esophageal emptying was slower than controls. Abnormal motility studies included 9 patients with nutcracker esophagus and 5 patients with nonspecific motor disorder. After 1 mo of abstinence, 5 of 6 patients with nutcracker esophagus and one with nonspecific motor disorder became normal. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure and esophageal contraction amplitude also returned to normal. These abnormal findings were independent of neuropathy. One patient who had normal manometry and emptying had esophagitis. We demonstrated that esophageal dysfunction is common in alcoholics, even in the absence of esophagitis and neuropathy, suggesting that these do not play a major role in esophageal dysmotility. Nutcracker esophagus is a reversible and common manometric finding in asymptomatic alcoholics.\r"

We studied in vitro the contractile response of longitudinal duodenal muscles from various animals (guinea pig, rabbit, dog) to porcine and canine synthetic motilins. Both substances failed to elicit contraction of the guinea pig duodenum but were active and equally potent on rabbit muscle. In dogs, porcine motilin was inactive at the concentrations tested (up to 10(-4) M) whereas canine motilin induced duodenal contractions in a dose-response fashion (mean dose required to induce half-maximal response: 4.82 +/- 0.25 X 10(-5) M). The contraction generated by synthetic canine motilin (10(-5) M) was not influenced by atropine, hexamethonium, tetrodotoxin, naloxone, or sodium nitroprusside (all used at 10(-4) M) but was blocked by verapamil (10(-4)). Our study shows that species-related structural alterations in motilin molecules generate different bioactive capacities in some animal species, suggests that the middle portion of the molecule is important for its bioactive expression, suggests the presence of motilin receptors on canine duodenal muscle, and suggests that an influx of extracellular calcium is involved in the canine duodenal muscle contraction elicited by canine motilin.\r"

Two groups were identified as follows: 10 group 1 patients had exophytic tumors less than 3 cm in diameter, and 85 group 2 patients had more advanced tumors. Local control of the tumor was obtained in all patients in group 1 without complication. Eighty-five percent of group 2 patients were symptomatically improved by the treatment. The survival rate (by life table analysis method) at 24 mo was only 19%, but the percentage of surviving patients who remained symptomatically improved was high [90% (3 mo) to 68% (24 mo)]. Factors influencing improvement or survival rates include the main symptom at the beginning of treatment, reason for choosing laser treatment, and circumferential extent of tumor base. There was one fatal perforation and one perirectal abscess. Laser photoablation was able to locally control small rectosigmoid carcinomas in patients unable to undergo incisional surgery. Laser treatment provided relief of symptoms in inoperable patients with advanced rectosigmoid carcinomas.\r"

Five of the 13 children were HLA-DR identical to the celiac sibling, 5 shared only one HLA-DR antigen with the celiac sibling, and 3 had completely different HLA-DR antigens than their respective celiac brothers or sisters. Clinical evaluation and functional tests (routine blood, xylose absorption, and fecal fat excretion studies) were performed before, during, and after gluten challenge. A jejunal biopsy specimen was taken at the end of the 4-wk period of gluten supplementation. No clinical abnormalities were found during the period of the study and there was no significant decrease of xylose absorption. Fecal fat excretion studies gave normal results, both before and after gluten challenge. The high gluten diet did not lead to histopathologic abnormalities in any of the jejunal biopsy specimens, which showed a normal range of crypt to villus ratio and surface-cell height. The present results do not support the view that excessive gluten intake is toxic for individuals who are genetically predisposed but do not have overt celiac disease. The findings also suggest that other factors besides HLA-DR antigens and gluten intake are important for expression of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Self-filling blind loops of rat jejunum were used as a model for the blind loop syndrome in humans. Electrical resistance, short circuit current, and unidirectional sodium and chloride fluxes were measured using the Ussing technique. Whereas net fluxes for sodium and chloride did not differ significantly from zero in the blind loop or in the control, unidirectional fluxes of either direction were decreased and electrical resistance was increased, indicating an increase in the tightness of the intestinal wall. Measurements of alternating current impedance and micropuncture experiments revealed that this was due to an increase in epithelial resistance from 9 +/- 1 omega X cm2 (n = 15, results of both methods) to 27 +/- 4 omega X cm2 (n = 15) and in subepithelial resistance from 40 +/- 2 omega X cm2 (n = 15) to 76 +/- 7 omega X cm2 (n = 15). As the ratio of epithelial to subepithelial resistance was similar in the blind loop and in the control, lower transport rates in the blind loop are indicative of impaired epithelial transport function. Subsequently, two different transport systems were characterized. First, the 3-o-methyl-glucose-induced, phlorizin-reversible increase in short circuit current, representing glucose-coupled sodium absorption, showed a 77% decrease in maximum velocity in the blind loop and no change in Km. Second, the chloride-induced, bumetanide-reversible increase in short circuit current in tissues stimulated simultaneously by prostaglandin E1 and theophylline, representing rheogenic chloride secretion, also showed a decrease in maximum velocity (of 83%) and no change in Km. A morphometric analysis revealed that the crypt surface area increased by 100% in the blind loop, whereas the villous surface area was not significantly different between blind loops and controls. We conclude that the jejunal self-filling blind loop is characterized by impaired active ion transport processes and an increase in epithelial and subepithelial resistance.\r"

The analogue D-Phe11 neurotensin was as potent as neurotensin itself with respect to stimulation of amylase secretion. Basal plasma neurotensin levels were approximately 10 pmol/L, a concentration that stimulates the exocrine pancreas in vitro. Increases in plasma neurotensin levels induced by infusion of neurotensin caused greater increases in secretion of pancreatic amylase than did similar changes of neurotensin concentration in vitro. These results suggest that in addition to its direct action, other factors are involved in modulation of the effects of neurotensin on pancreatic exocrine function in vivo.\r"

In patients with neoplastic disease an enlargement of the proliferative compartment was found, whereas 6 patients with Crohn's colitis had values for labeling index and a distribution of labeled cells along the crypt comparable to that of control subjects.

Perfusion with HCl increased alkaline secretion to 4.39 +/- 0.17 mu Eq/cm2 . 10 min and led to superficial damage of 51.8% of the villi. Intravenous treatment with NaHCO3 and glucagon increased alkaline secretion (+25% and +37%, respectively) and decreased damage (-27.7% and -25.3%, respectively), whereas mucosal blood flow as assessed by radioactive microspheres was stimulated only by glucagon. Intravenous treatment with NH4Cl, vasopressin, and furosemide decreased alkaline secretion (-31%, -52%, and -50%, respectively) and led to increased damage (+18.5%, +19.3%, and +19.6% superficial and 30%-50% deep lesions), and mucosal blood flow was decreased (vasopressin) or unchanged. There was a direct linear relationship (r = 0.88, y = 103-15.8x) between the degree of damage and alkaline secretion.

The superficial mucosal vessels were monitored on a television screen through a microscope and videorecorded for off-line analysis of red cell velocities and vessel diameters, from which blood flow was calculated. Intravenous omeprazole (5 or 10 mumol/kg) totally abolished the basal secretion 15-25 min after injection, with a parallel decrease in blood flow of approximately 25% for both doses. Omeprazole, 5 mumol/kg, given intravenously to rats stimulated with pentagastrin (20 micrograms/kg X h) significantly inhibited the stimulated acid output, but the blood flow was not significantly decreased. Topical application of omeprazole (2.5 mM in 6 ml) significantly increased blood flow (approximately 15%) while in contact with the mucosa both in the resting and in the pentagastrin (20 micrograms/kg X h)-stimulated situations. However, 10-20 min after the application period, blood flow was restored to the values before application of omeprazole and the acid output was significantly decreased. The results indicate that omeprazole exerts only minor influences on the gastric mucosal microcirculation in spite of its potent acid-inhibitory effect.\r"

Specific hormone binding to cytosol and nuclei from normal liver containing such receptors is of high affinity, low capacity, saturable, and specific for steroidal and nonsteroidal estrogens. Although estrogens alter metabolism and may produce disease, little data is available concerning estrogen receptor levels found in diseased liver. Herein we report estrogen receptor levels in human female liver containing diseases associated with oral contraceptives. Binding studies demonstrated cytosolic and nuclear estrogen receptors in human hepatic adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia. Nuclear estrogen receptor levels in neoplastic tissue were greater than those in normal tissue. In addition, one hepatic adenoma resected from a patient taking tamoxifen contained no cytosolic estrogen receptor, and nuclear estrogen receptor levels were significantly lower than those found in normal tissue. These differences in binding capacity suggest a potential for greater hormone responsiveness in neoplastic liver tissue.\r"

In this study, the influence of cholesterol feeding on the contractile response to calcium and on the concentration of the contractile proteins actin and myosin was determined. Strips of gallbladder smooth muscle, at their optimal length for tension development, were stimulated maximally with carbachol. Then the muscle cell membranes were made permeable and strips were exposed to a maximally effective concentration of calcium. Strips from cholesterol fed animals developed less stress than those from control animals under all conditions. The concentration of actin and myosin was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. There were no differences in the concentrations of either protein between the cholesterol-fed and control animals. Our results indicate that the decreased contractile response seen in muscle from cholesterol-fed animals is not due to alterations in membrane excitation, excitation-contraction coupling, or in total contractile proteins.\r"

Venous pressures were measured by portal and hepatic vein catheterizations, blood flow by the pulsed Doppler flowmeter, organ volume by computed tomography, and intrahepatic shunt index by 99mTc-macroaggregated albumin instilled in the portal vein. The patients with idiopathic portal hypertension were divided into two groups: group A (n = 8) and group B (n = 9), consisting of those who respectively had portal venous flow per liver volume above and below the mean + 2 SD of healthy adults. In group A, portal vein pressure was moderately elevated, portal venous flow was significantly increased compared with the control, and portal vascular resistance was not much altered. In group B, portal vein pressure was markedly elevated above that of control, portal venous flow was comparable, and portal vascular resistance was significantly elevated. Splenic venous flow measured in the splenic vein between the left and short gastric veins was markedly increased in groups A and B, the increase being greater in the former. It was concluded that in some patients with idiopathic portal hypertension, increased portal venous flow, partly a result of increased splenic venous flow secondary to splenomegaly of an undetermined process, is the main contributor initially to the elevation of portal vein pressure; in others, possibly later, increased portal vascular resistance plays an important role.\r"

Although the instrument had been cleaned repeatedly with an automatic endoscope cleaning machine, P. aeruginosa survived on residual moisture left in the channels of the endoscope. Contamination ended only after we began to manually suction alcohol through the endoscope before air drying. In 5 of 10 patients, P. aeruginosa caused clinical infections including gangrenous cholecystitis, abscesses, and death. We could identify no factor that distinguished symptomatic from asymptomatic patients. In asymptomatic patients, P. aeruginosa was recovered from gallbladder bile up to 2 mo after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. As this P. aeruginosa epidemic was discovered retrospectively because we monitor bile cultures, we advocate this practice as part of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacologic properties and specificity of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors of the biliary tract were investigated by testing various sulfated and desulfated CCK fractions and by using specific CCK-gastrin antagonists. Sulfated CCK-7 (5-80 pmol/kg) caused gallbladder contraction and sphincter of Oddi relaxation. Denervation with tetrodotoxin decreased the gallbladder response by 50% and changed the sphincter of Oddi response from relaxation to contraction. Desulfated CCK-7 (80-400 pmol/kg) caused a weak gallbladder contraction that was unaffected by tetrodotoxin. The gallbladder did not respond to CCK-3 (10-80 nmol/kg) or to CCK-2 (10-160 nmol/kg) in doses that completely relaxed the sphincter of Oddi. These doses, however, were 5-2000 times higher than the maximal dose of sulfated CCK-7. After denervation with tetrodotoxin, desulfated CCK-7 (10-400 pmol/kg) induced a weak sphincter of Oddi contraction even with doses five times greater than the maximal dose of sulfated CCK-7. The denervated sphincter of Oddi did not respond to CCK-3 (10-80 nmol/kg) or CCK-2 (10-160 nmol/kg). Furthermore, a continuous proglumide infusion (5-20 mg/kg X min) and bolus doses of dibutyryl cyclic guanosine monophosphate (250-1000 micrograms/kg) blocked the effect of sulfated CCK-8 on the gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi. Higher doses of these antagonists were needed, however, to block the CCK effect on the sphincter of Oddi than on the gallbladder. In contrast, high doses of desulfated CCK-7 (100 pmol/kg) or CCK-3 (200 nmol/kg) did not antagonize the effect of sulfated CCK-8 (10-80 pmol/kg) on the gallbladder. These findings suggest the existence of three sets of specific CCK receptors with molecular configuration requirements determined by the type of cell where these receptors are located: on the postganglionic cholinergic neurons, on the smooth muscle cells of the gallbladder, and sphincter of Oddi, or on the postganglionic noncholinergic, nonadrenergic inhibitory neurons.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that pancreatic polypeptide promotes postcontractile gallbladder filling was tested in the prairie dog model. Fifteen animals underwent laparotomy with catheter placement into the gallbladder, distal common bile duct (vent), and femoral vein. The gallbladder was perfused with [14C]polyethylene glycol labeled lactated Ringer's solution at 0.03 ml/min and vent effluent was collected at 2.5-min intervals. All animals received a 20-min intravenous infusion of cholecystokinin-octapeptide, 2.5 ng/kg X min, immediately followed by 60-min infusions of either lactated Ringer's solution or bovine pancreatic polypeptide (PP), 10 or 50 ng/kg X min. Gallbladder emptying and intragallbladder pressure were similar for all three groups after cholecystokinin-octapeptide. When lactated Ringer's was administered after cholecystokinin-octapeptide, gallbladder filling increased by 15.6% with a minimal change in gallbladder pressure. In contrast, infusion of PP10 resulted in a significant (p less than 0.02) increase in gallbladder filling, 64.1% +/- 17.1%, and a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in intragallbladder pressure, as compared to controls. Similar findings were noted with PP50. These data indicate that exogenous PP significantly increases gallbladder filling after cholecystokinin-induced gallbladder contraction. This enhanced filling results from gallbladder relaxation as manifested by decreased intraluminal pressure. These findings coupled with the observation that serum PP levels remain elevated for up to 6 h after a meal suggest that PP may play a role in the regulation of postprandial gallbladder filling.\r"

We report five members of two Jewish-Iranian families in whom chronic neuropathic intestinal pseudoobstruction was associated with an identical and unique progressive severe neuronal disease. It appeared within the first two decades of life. The disease consisted of external ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and severe sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy. Three patients also had neuronal hearing loss. There was no evidence of central nervous system involvement and all patients were mentally intact. The combined disease was confirmed by radiologic, electrophysiologic, and histologic studies. Specific nutritional deficiencies, toxic elements, and systemic diseases affecting both the gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system were ruled out. It seems that these patients suffer from an autosomal recessive, presently unrecognized variant, of chronic neuropathic intestinal pseudoobstruction. In a patient with severe peripheral neuropathy of unknown etiology associated with symptoms suggestive of intestinal obstruction, the possibility of chronic neuropathic intestinal pseudoobstruction has to be considered.\r"

Before removal of the tumor both diagnostic tests recommended for the detection of a somatostatinoma, a tolbutamide test and a calcium-pentagastrin test, were performed. Whereas the calcium-pentagastrin test provoked a markedly elevated plasma somatostatin level in association with a depressed plasma neurotensin level, the tolbutamide test surprisingly did not. After removal of the tumor the calcium-pentagastrin test no longer induced hypersomatostatinemia. Further studies are needed to determine whether the calcium-pentagastrin test is a more reliable diagnostic test than the tolbutamide test in somatostatinomas with normal plasma basal levels.\r"

Improving the benefit/risk ratio for indicated anticoagulation involves consideration of the following: hemostatic competence, blood pressure, drug interactions, falls, interval surgery, diet, aspirin and last but not least, the intensity of anticoagulant prophylaxis. For the present it would be prudent to limit heparin administration to a low-dose regimen not exceeding 20,000 units/24 hours and warfarin maintenance to a low-dose prothrombin time ratio of 1.5.\r"

Most of the motor activity was represented by low amplitude contractions present singly or in bursts, which showed no recognisable pattern. All but two subjects also showed isolated high amplitude (up to 200 mmHg) contractions that propagated peristaltically over long distances at approximately 1 cm/sec. Most of these contractions occurred after morning awakening, and some in the late postprandial period, with a mean of 4.4/subject/24 h. The peristaltic contractions were often felt as an urge to defecate or preceded defecation, and could represent the manometric equivalent of the mass movements.\r"

The gastric concentration of CEA did not differ between patient groups with different superimposed lesions. In these patients the gastric juice CEA concentrations were significantly increased in comparison with those in patients without superimposed lesions (p = 0.002). Gastric juice CEA concentrations above the upper range (+2SD) of those observed in normal controls were found in 40 (98%) of 41 patients with superimposed lesions and in 13 (65%) of 20 patients without such lesions (p = 0.001). At re-examination of 26 patients without neoplasia initially, after a mean interval of 32 months two (without polyps initially), had developed regenerative polyps, one an adenoma, and one an adenocarcinoma. These four had raised gastric juice CEA concentrations at the initial examination.\r"

Tumours were induced with azoxymethane 10 mg/kg weekly for 12 weeks. At 26 weeks there was a promotion of colonic neoplasia from a median of 0.5 (range 0-3) per rat in the transection group to 1.0 (0-3) in the 50% resected group (p less than 0.01) but no significant promotion in the 80% resection group. In the small bowel, increasing resection resulted in a progressive promotion of tumours from a median of 1.0 (range 0-3) per rat in the transection group to 2.0 (0-5) in the 50% resection group (p less than 0.001) and 3.0 (0-11) in the 80% group (p less than 0.01). Plasma enteroglucagon was measured at 2, 16, and 26 weeks and was raised seven-fold in the 80% resected group (p less than 0.001). There was a significant correlation between enteroglucagon concentrations and number of duodenal tumours but not colonic tumours. Crypt cell production rate in the duodenum increased from 11.5 +/- 1.9 to 29.2 +/- 1.4 cells/crypt/h in the 80% resected group (p less than 0.001) and showed a close correlation with both enteroglucagon levels and tumour promotion in the small bowel. There were no changes in crypt cell production rate in the colon with resection. This study shows a close association between enteroglucagon concentrations, promotion of tumours and crypt cell production rate in the duodenum but not in the colon.\r"

The following groups were studied: One hundred and thirteen patients with endoscopically confirmed non-ulcer dyspepsia in the absence of clinical, biochemical or radiological evidence of other gastrointestinal diseases or disorders, termed essential dyspepsia; Fifty five patients with symptomatic and endoscopically proven peptic ulceration (32 duodenal ulcers, 23 gastric ulcers); Fifty three patients admitted to hospital with biliary pain and cholelithiasis without other lesion at laparotomy. All patients completed a structured history questionnaire at personal interview. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was done on 19 predefined variables to determine if one or more of these could discriminate between the diagnostic categories. The results suggest that certain groups of symptoms may be of diagnostic value, but many are not. Upper abdominal pain aggravated by food or milk, pain severity, night pain, vomiting, weight loss, and age significantly discriminated essential dyspepsia from the other diagnostic categories. A scoring system was established based on these discriminating symptoms. Using the weighted score, at a sensitivity of 57%, the specificity for a diagnosis of essential dyspepsia was 94%, but only prospective studies will determine if this scoring system is of actual clinical value.\r"

The main clinical manifestations in these patients were nausea and vomiting (83%), abdominal pain (74%), distension (57%), constipation (36%), diarrhoea (29%), and urinary symptoms (17%). These symptoms preceded surgery in all patients. Air fluid levels or distended bowel loops occurred in 57% and a dilated bladder or urinary excretory pathway in 17%. All patients showed intestinal manometric abnormalities none of which are seen in healthy individuals: aberrant configuration or propagation of interdigestive motor complexes in 25 patients; bursts (greater than 2 min duration) of non-propagated phasic pressure activity in fasting and/or fed state in 30 patients; sustained incoordinated fasting pressure activity in 15 patients; and inability of an ingested meal to convert fasting into fed pattern in 28 patients. We conclude that qualitative analysis of intestinal manometry provides evidence of gut dysmotility in patients with the clinical syndrome of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. These abnormalities of motility can help to establish the correct diagnosis.\r"

To clarify this we have analysed the morphology of the small intestinal epithelium and quantified its renewal in chronically ethanol fed rats. Twenty adult male rats were pair fed for 28 days a nutritionally adequate liquid diet containing either ethanol as 36% of total calories or an isocaloric diet in which fat substituted for ethanol. Crypt cell production rate was determined in the jejunum and ileum by the metaphase arrest method. Weight gain and small intestinal morphology were similar in ethanol fed and control rats, but enterocyte turnover was significantly reduced in the jejunum (p less than 0.05) and ileum (p less than 0.01) of the ethanol fed rats. This effect of ethanol on the small intestine is probably systemic rather than local, because the changes in jejunum and ileum were similar, and it may contribute to the development of malnutrition in chronic alcoholics.\r"

One hundred and ninety two animals with induced acute pancreatitis were divided into eight groups fed either a mixture of water and 15% ethanol (v/v), or tap water combined with standard or special diets according to their group, for 12 weeks. The other control 192 rats were divided into equal groups. Bile induced experimental acute pancreatitis caused the highest mortality (37.5%) in the animals receiving F diet and ethanol. In this group significant haemoconcentration, peritoneal exudate formation and the most extensive fat necrosis were also observed. The carbohydrate rich diet with or without ethanol did not have any significant effect on the severity of acute pancreatitis. Diet and ethanol may alter the metabolism of the pancreas and cause derangements at the systemic level. These derangements might cause the increased susceptibility to acute pancreatitis. These changes in the metabolism may be fatal because of the increased toxicity of the peritoneal exudate secreted during the inflammation.\r"

The rabbits had implanted Doppler ultrasonic flow probes on the lower aorta and an indwelling catheter for intra-arterial infusion of drugs. Autonomic blockade with mecamylamine and propranolol was used to determine local vascular effects of each drug uncomplicated by reflex changes. Logistic dose-vascular response curves were characterized by their range from resting to maximum response, their 50% effective dose (i.e., sensitivity or dose at middle of the response range), and the average slope about the 50% effective dose. At maximum dilatation the vascular resistance was about 70% greater in hypertensive rabbits than in normotensive rabbits. There were no significant differences in 50% effective dose values between curves for hypertensive and normotensive rabbits for constrictor or dilator drugs. However, with all drugs the hypertensive rabbits showed about twice the change in vascular resistance per unit dose compared with the normotensive rabbits. These results suggest that hypertrophy of the muscles of the precapillary vessels makes them a nonspecific amplifier of vascular resistance changes evoked by constrictor and dilator stimuli. They do not support previous claims of specific changes in \"sensitivity\" or claims that local amplifier action is unimportant in hypertension.\r"

Both drugs were administered in a 1.5-microliter volume into the lateral ventricle of the brain (i.c.v.) or into the cisterna magna (i.c.). The injection of vehicle alone (i.c. or i.c.v.) did not significantly change mean arterial pressure (MAP) or heart rate. Nifedipine (5 and 50 micrograms/kg) and BAY k 8644 (5 and 50 micrograms/kg) induced opposite effects on MAP when centrally injected. Nifedipine decreased MAP and induced a bradycardia (i.c.v.) or no change in heart rate (i.c.), and BAY k 8644 increased MAP without any significant change in heart rate (i.c. or i.c.v.). These effects were more marked with the highest dose of either drug. These effects seemed to be of central origin, since they were suppressed by ganglionic blockade by hexamethonium (100 mg/kg i.v.), whereas after hexamethonium the hypotensive and the hypertensive responses to intravenously injected nifedipine and BAY k 8644, respectively, were preserved. Bilateral vagotomy suppressed the bradycardia induced by i.c.v. administered nifedipine. Previously i.c.v. administered nifedipine (5 micrograms/kg) antagonized the pressor response to BAY k 8644 (5 micrograms/kg i.c.v.). Changes in MAP and heart rate were significantly more marked in SHR than in WKY. These results indicate that a calcium channel inhibitor and a calcium channel activator can modulate in opposite fashion central mechanisms involved in blood pressure control.\r"

The rats were fed a diet either high (1%), normal (0.1%), or low (0.01%) in magnesium for 12 weeks (WKY) and 20 weeks (SHR), respectively. Nifedipine was added to the diet for 4 weeks in concentrations of 300 and 1000 ppm. Each dose was given for 2 weeks. Plasma and intraerythrocytic concentrations of sodium, potassium, and magnesium were measured before and at the end of nifedipine treatment. Blood was obtained by cardiac puncture. In the WKY and SHR, blood pressure was not influenced by magnesium intake. The blood pressure-lowering effect of nifedipine was most pronounced on normal dietary magnesium and was significantly suppressed in the magnesium-deficient rats. Plasma and intracellular total magnesium concentrations were consistently increased during high and reduced during low dietary intake of the ion. Intracellular sodium concentration increased during magnesium deficiency and was normalized by nifedipine. The marked and long-term alterations in plasma and intracellular concentrations of magnesium did not influence arterial blood pressure levels in either the normotensive WKY or the SHR. Therefore, dietary magnesium intake does not appear to play an important role in long-term regulation of blood pressure in rats. However, magnesium depletion attenuates the blood pressure-lowering effect of nifedipine.\r"

The rats were fed a low sodium (0.1% NaCl) or high sodium (8% NaCl) diet for 8 weeks. Blood pressure in DS fed a high sodium diet was higher than that in the remaining animals. Aortic rings with and without endothelium were suspended for isometric tension recording. Acetylcholine, adenosine 5'-diphosphate, and thrombin induced endothelium-dependent relaxations that were significantly depressed in the aorta of DS fed a high sodium diet. The relaxations in response to sodium nitroprusside were only slightly, but significantly, depressed in DS fed a high sodium diet. Removal of the endothelium greatly enhanced the response to serotonin and norepinephrine. In rings with, but not without, endothelium taken from rats fed a high sodium diet, the tension developed in response to serotonin and norepinephrine was significantly greater than that in animals fed a low sodium diet. These experiments indicate that endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine, adenosine 5'-diphosphate, and thrombin are depressed in hypertensive Dahl rats; this effect probably reflects a decreased release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s), although structural changes might contribute; and the responsiveness to vasoconstrictor agents is increased in DS and DR fed a high sodium diet. These findings may indicate differential effects of blood pressure and dietary salt on endothelial function.\r"

The constriction was expressed in the form of a nondimensional tone as the difference between steady state and dilated diameter (after papaverine treatment) divided by the dilated diameter. Both animal strains showed on average a progressive increase of tone toward the more distal arterioles, with a peak tone being reached in the transverse arterioles. Tone values in the hypertensive animals were consistently elevated. The number of arterioles that had more than 5% tone (so-called responder arterioles) was higher in the hypertensive animals. These studies suggest that, besides the anatomical adjustments documented earlier in our laboratory in the arteriolar network of this muscle, functional adjustments in the form of an elevated microvascular tone are associated with the elevated resistance in spontaneously hypertensive rats.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate a possible sex difference in the development of deoxycorticosterone (DOC)-salt hypertension in rats, systolic blood pressure was measured over 6 weeks in unilaterally nephrectomized male and female rats with or without DOC-salt treatment. Throughout the treatment, systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in female than in male DOC-salt rats (at the end of the sixth week: 190 +/- 8 vs 163 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). The difference in blood pressure was also confirmed by the direct measurement of mean arterial pressure at the end of the experiment. The 24-hour urinary excretion of vasopressin was significantly higher in male control rats than in female control rats; however, no difference was observed between male and female DOC-salt rats, in which the urinary excretion of vasopressin was four to five times higher than in control rats. The plasma vasopressin concentration was higher in DOC-salt rats, but there were no differences between sexes. There were no differences in the metabolic clearance rate of vasopressin among the four groups of rats. This indicates that the elevated plasma vasopressin concentration in DOC-salt hypertensive rats is due to increased release of the hormone, rather than to impaired metabolism. Thus, although vasopressin plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of DOC-salt hypertension, the sexual dimorphism in this form of hypertension cannot be attributed to differences in the secretion, metabolism, or plasma concentration of vasopressin.\r"

The change in physical fitness between the 2 examination years was related to the change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (i.e., children with a decline in physical fitness showed the largest rise in blood pressure). These observations suggest that the level of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in children is associated with the level of physical fitness. They also indicate that change in blood pressure in childhood may be related to change in physical fitness.\r"

Hypertensive subjects exhibited lower mean scores on this index when education was ignored, but results were not the same for highly educated and less well educated groups. There were no differences between exceptionally well educated hypertensive and normotensive subjects, but in the less well educated group, hypertensive subjects performed more poorly than normotensive subjects. The percentages of hypertensive and normotensive subjects scoring in a cognitively impaired range on the Average Impairment Rating were low and did not differ for either education group. These data indicate the important role of subtle differences in education level with respect to positive or negative findings for studies comparing hypertensive and normotensive subjects and illustrate the important role of clinical neuropsychological indices of cognitive dysfunction when one wishes to make meaningful inferences regarding cerebral cortical function in hypertensive subjects.\r"

This pattern was not explained by differences in initial severity of hypertension, control of hypertension, obesity, smoking, or alcohol consumption. A sex-specific analysis showed that the pattern was confined to male subjects, but it is argued that it might be seen in female subjects if data for women of more advanced age were available. Further lines of investigation of this interesting phenomenon are proposed.\r"

In 16 subjects the peak mean blood pressure and heart rate rises that occurred in the early part of the physician's first visit (22.6 +/- 1.8 mm Hg and 17.7 +/- 1.7 beats/min) were virtually identical to those occurring during three subsequent visits by the same physician throughout a 2-day intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring. The less pronounced pressor and tachycardic responses observed in the last part of the physician's visit also were virtually identical among the four visits. In contrast, in 30 other subjects the blood pressure and heart rate rises that occurred during the nurse's visit were 46.7% and 42.1% less (p less than 0.01) than those occurring during the physician's visit. The late and less pronounced pressor and tachycardic responses to the visit were also significantly less (p less than 0.01) in the former than in the latter condition. These results indicate that the error of overestimation of blood pressure inherent in cuff blood pressure measurement by a physician cannot be avoided by repeated visits by the physician over a short time span. It clearly can be reduced, however, if blood pressure measurements are performed by a nurse.\r"

Calcium levels were 21% higher in the hypertensive subjects (p = 0.02), and a 9% increase in sodium was observed in an expanded sample (p = 0.04). Neither intracellular calcium nor intracellular sodium had a significant linear correlation with blood pressure when hypertensive subjects and controls were examined separately or when the two groups were combined. Potassium was slightly but not significantly increased in hypertensive subjects. Among the participants for whom both calcium and sodium measurements were available, a weak, nonsignificant correlation between these ions was noted (r = 0.2; n = 48). This correlation was significant among participants in the control group examined separately (r = 0.3; n = 33; p = 0.05). Although the measurements were performed in different cell lines, these findings demonstrate increases in both intracellular calcium and sodium in hypertensive humans.\r"

Basal [Ca2+]i was significantly higher in hypertensive subjects (n = 32) than in normotensive controls (n = 30; 167.4 +/- 5.0 vs 143.2 +/- 3.1 nmol/L; p less than 0.001). Epinephrine, norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and ouabain had no effect on platelet calcium, whereas thrombin induced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i in both the presence and absence of extracellular calcium. This [Ca2+]i increase in the presence of extracellular calcium, which depends mainly on calcium influx, was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in platelets of hypertensive subjects at all thrombin concentrations (ranging from 0.025-0.1 U/ml), while the [Ca2+]i increase in the absence of extracellular calcium, which depends only on release from intracellular stores, was similar in hypertensive subjects and controls. These results suggest that, in essential hypertension, there is not only increased platelet resting [Ca2+]i but also an increase in agonist-mediated calcium influx, which appears to indicate a cell membrane abnormality in the platelets of subjects with essential hypertension.\r"

After adjustment for height, age, sex, and race, significant relationships were found for both central body fat (r = 0.19 and 0.14, p less than 0.0001) and peripheral body fat (r = 0.15 and 0.12; p less than 0.0001) with systolic and diastolic (fourth phase) blood pressure, respectively. However, the relationship between peripheral body fat and blood pressure, after controlling for the level of central body fat, was negligible (r = 0.00 and 0.01 for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively). In contrast, the central body fat-blood pressure relationship remained statistically significant even after controlling for the peripheral body fat level. For central body fat, the partial correlations with systolic blood pressure were highest in young children (r = 0.15), dropped slightly during adolescence (r = 0.12), and became nonsignificant only in 18- to 24-year-old female subjects; correlations remained high in both black and white 18- to 24-year-old male subjects (r = 0.18 and 0.16, respectively). Mean levels of systolic blood pressure from the lowest to the highest quartile of central body fat ranged from 100.4 to 108.9 mm Hg. The adult hypertension-central body fat relationship, which has been shown by others, appears to exist in children. Continued efforts at early identification and prevention of obesity in children are warranted.\r"

To address that problem, we determined the effects on renal blood flow of PAF administered directly into the renal artery in pentobarbital (30 mg/kg)-anesthetized dogs. Bolus injections of PAF (0.2-0.8 microgram) caused transient renal vasoconstriction, reducing renal blood flow by 20 to 60% without altering systemic blood pressure; lyso-PAF (1 microgram) had no effect. The effects of PAF on renal blood flow were not altered by alpha-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine, 3 mg/kg) or by angiotensin II receptor blockade ([Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II, 6 micrograms/kg/min), but they were increased in magnitude and duration by meclofenamate (5 mg/kg), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Methysergide (3 mg/kg), a serotonin antagonist, slightly reduced PAF effects, but a specific blocker of vascular serotonin receptors did not. Renal venous plasma platelet density was not altered by infusion of PAF into the renal artery at a dose (1-2 micrograms/min) that caused a sustained 20% renal blood flow decrease. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine that competitively inhibited PAF-induced aggregation in canine platelet-rich plasma, also inhibited the renal vasoconstrictor action of PAF (0.8 mg/min, into the renal artery) but did not alter renal vasoconstrictor effects of norepinephrine or angiotensin II.\r"

  ".W": "A lack of correlation between blood pressure and myocardial hypertrophy was established in spontaneously hypertensive rats, suggesting that factors other than blood pressure control might be responsible for the modulation of myocardial hypertrophy. An in vitro system that is independent of blood pressure and hemodynamic effects was developed by use of isolated myocytes to study myocardial protein synthesis. The validity of this system was determined by means of morphology, by receptor integrity, and by studying the incorporation of tritiated leucine into myocyte protein (dpm/mg/hr). Addition of a supernatant of spontaneously hypertensive rat myocardial homogenate (centrifuged at 1500 g) to the myocyte system resulted in a significant increase in tritiated leucine incorporation into myocyte protein when compared with the addition of homogenates from normal controls. The protein from the homogenate was partially purified by high performance liquid chromatography. The resultant purified protein also stimulated protein synthesis by 70%. Furthermore, a significant increase in the specific activity of the transfer RNA and the rate of protein synthesis was observed after addition of homogenate from hypertrophied heart (4.02 +/- 0.3 vs 7.0 +/- 0.2 pmol leucine/microgram protein/hr; p less than 0.05). These data demonstrate the existence of a soluble factor in the hypertrophied myocardium that stimulated protein synthesis. This factor may play a key role in modulation of myocardial structure during development or regression of myocardial hypertrophy in hypertension.\r"

Mesenteric arteries from normotensive and hypertensive rats were excised and cut into helical strips for isometric force recording. Dose-response curves to serotonin in arteries from hypertensive rats were shifted significantly to the left compared with those in arteries from normotensive rats (ED25: DOCA-treated = 2.4 X 10(-8) M; control = 17.1 X 10(-8) M). Contractile responses to 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid and 5-hydroxytryptophol were greater in mesenteric arteries from hypertensive rats, whereas reactivity to 5-methoxytryptamine and melatonin in arteries from hypertensive rats did not differ from that in arteries from normotensive rats. Mesenteric arteries from both rat groups were unresponsive to the serotonin metabolite N-acetylserotonin. Contractile responses to 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine and 6-hydroxytryptamine were greater in mesenteric arteries from hypertensive rats, whereas responsiveness to 3-hydroxytryptamine in hypertensive arteries did not differ from normotensive values. Contractile responses to serotonin and its metabolites and to the structurally related monoamines were inhibited by the serotonergic antagonist ketanserin. These results demonstrate that vascular sensitivity to serotonin is increased in DOCA-hypertensive rats. Based on the experiments with serotonin metabolites and with other monoamines, the increased responsiveness to these compounds appears to be related to the structural location of hydroxyl and amine moieties.\r"

  ".W": "The sodium-proton exchange activity was determined in lymphocytes of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), and domestic Wistar rats. Uptake of sodium was determined by measuring the osmotic swelling of lymphocytes after activation of the exchanger by suspension of the cells in sodium propionate and consequent intracellular acidification by the permeant weak acid. Fractional swelling (mean +/- SEM) in 16 SHR and 16 WKY was 0.44 +/- 0.03 and 0.35 +/- 0.02, respectively (p less than 0.01). The swelling was partially inhibitable by amiloride and, at 10(-4) M concentration, the amiloride-sensitive swelling was 0.21 +/- 0.02 in SHR and 0.11 +/- 0.01 in WKY (p = 0.001). Progressive extracellular ion substitutions of chloride for propionate or of potassium for sodium showed that the exchange activity was related linearly to cellular acidification; however, the dependence on extracellular sodium displayed saturation characteristics, with the same apparent Km for cells from SHR and WKY and a Vmax of 0.54 +/- 0.03 for SHR and 0.39 +/- 0.02 for WKY (p less than 0.002). External lithium could replace sodium on the exchanger but abolished the differences between strains. Results in the domestic Wistar rats were similar to those of WKY. These results suggest that lymphocytes of the SHR have a greater capacity for sodium uptake through the sodium-proton exchanger, as compared with normotensive strains. If shared by other cells, such an increased capacity could have a pathophysiological role in genetic hypertension. In particular, its presence in proximal renal tubular cells would support the hypothesis of a primary role for the kidney in the pathogenesis of genetic hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "A 41-year-old man with a remote history of neck and mediastinal radiation was seen with severe paroxysms of hypertension, headache, and cutaneous flushing after bilateral carotid bypass surgery. Investigation revealed marked parallel fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate and elevation of plasma norepinephrine to 1164 pg/ml during a paroxysm. We systematically evaluated his arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflex function by assessing changes in heart rate, arterial pressure, and efferent muscle sympathetic nerve activity, which was measured directly by the microneurographic technique. Elevating resting arterial pressure from 130/88 to 164/100 mm Hg with phenylephrine or lowering it to 88/56 mm Hg with nitroprusside produced no reflex changes in heart rate or efferent sympathetic nerve activity. In contrast, decreases in cardiac filling pressures with lower body negative pressure produced a marked increase in sympathetic nerve activity. These findings indicate complete loss of the afferent limb of the arterial baroreceptor reflex but preservation of the cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflex. They suggest that both carotid and aortic baroreceptors were impaired by the previous radiation and surgery. Despite the loss of arterial baroreceptor function, the patient did not have sustained hypertension. The paroxysms of hypertension appear to be due to spontaneous fluctuations in central sympathetic drive not buffered by arterial baroreceptors in a manner similar to that seen in sinoaortic-denervated animals.\r"

Some of them, such as albumin and the amino acids, are close to being an ideal osmotic agent but are prohibitively costly to manufacture. We predict that interest in the future will focus on dialysis solutions containing a mixture of osmotic agents. Such a solution would be acceptable for both short and long-dwell exchanges. It will have a sufficiently low concentration of different agents to minimize toxicity and long-term undesirable side effects. We expect that solutions will be available to better meet patients needs in the near future.\r"

The clearances of inulin and para-aminohippurate (PAH) were used to estimate renal hemodynamic measurements. These parameters were determined after 2 weeks of HCTZ plus placebo and at 1, 3, and 6 months after the addition of beta-blocker to HCTZ. Significant reductions in blood pressure and heart rate were seen, but no significant reduction of renal hemodynamics were seen with either beta-blocker-HCTZ combination. Since 50% of the patients in each drug group were either Black or White, hemodynamic data were also analyzed by race. One month after beta-blocker addition there was a slight reduction of GFR in both Whites (47 +/- 6 vs. 40 +/- 5 ml/min, p greater than .05) and Blacks (44 +/- 5 vs. 40 +/- 6 ml/min, p less than .05). By month 6, GFR in Whites rose to 57 +/- 9 ml/min, whereas in Blacks it fell significantly to 36 +/- 6 ml/min (p less than .01). Similarly, at month 1, ERBF declined by 12% and 13% in Whites and Blacks, respectively. However, at month 6, ERBF rose by 28% in Whites and remained 11% lower in Blacks, p less than .05. In summary, in the group as a whole neither beta-blocker significantly altered renal hemodynamics when added to HCTZ therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A series of 9 patients with acute hepatic failure and Grade IV hepatic coma received daily plasmapheresis until they recovered or death ensued. Of the nine, seven (77%) showed an improvement in coma grade and five (55%) survived to leave hospital. Plasmapheresis significantly decreased serum bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase and plasma ammonia concentrations. Survival following plasmapheresis appeared substantially better than in a non randomized group of similar patients not plasmapheresed. The simplicity of the procedure, biochemical improvements observed and apparent efficacy, suggest that further evaluation of the technique as a means of providing temporary hepatic support is indicated.\r"

  ".W": "We retrospectively analyzed a program of prior deposit and storage of autologous blood that was used for patients who underwent elective orthopaedic procedures over a period of thirty-six months at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Of a total of 211 patients who underwent total joint replacement or spinal fusion during this period and who had sufficient records to be included in the study, a total of 159 patients enrolled in the program. The fifty-two patients who did not enroll in the study, twelve of whom were rejected because of medical problems, served as a control group. Since the preoperative hematocrit values for patients in the group that received autologous blood were similar to those for the control group, multiple preoperative phlebotomies in these patients, who had received supplemental iron, did not seem to have any deleterious effects. One hundred and thirteen (71 per cent) of the 159 patients who were enrolled in the program received only autologous blood. The remaining forty-six patients required homologous blood also, but 64 per cent of their transfusion needs were provided by autologous blood. The only reactions to the transfusions in the study were in four patients who received homologous blood. We think that a program of prior deposit and storage of autologous blood should be an option for patients who are to undergo elective orthopaedic surgery. Such a program is well tolerated by the patients and easily managed by the staff, and it was not difficult to implement at our tertiary referral hospital.\r"
