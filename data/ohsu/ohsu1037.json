  ".U": "91195767\r", 
  ".W": "A survey of 364 college freshman women was conducted to examine weight loss practices. Nearly 60% of women were currently on a diet to lose or to maintain weight. Since entering college 7 months earlier, 29% had used crash dieting or fasting as a means of weight control. Even though most had experimented with purging and diet pills in high school, most of these had discontinued these practices. Twenty percent had at some time used diet pills, but only 4% were currently users; 13% had at some time used purgatives (vomiting, laxatives, or diuretics), but only 5% were current users. Use of purgatives may indicate a more general pattern of addictive health behavior. Compared to women who had never used purgatives, current purgative users were 4.1 times more likely to smoke (44% vs 11%) and 2.7 times as likely to use drugs (33% vs 12%). Of the 51 women who had ever smoked, 37% listed weight control as a reason for it. Longitudinal investigations are needed to determine how weight loss practices track from adolescence into adulthood and to determine factors predisposing to the establishment of unhealthy weight loss practices, such as severely restrictive dieting, \"yo-yo dieting\" (weight cycling), and use of diet pills, purgatives, or tobacco.\r"

We reviewed 44 Mississippi cases of arsenic exposures occurring from January 1986 to May 1990. We compared the epidemiologic differences between unintentional and intentional poisonings. Cases were found and characterized through the two toxicology laboratories and hospital records. Arsenic-based rodenticides were the arsenic source in 23 of the 44 exposures. Other sources were monosodium methylarsenate (4 cases), dodecyl ammonium methane arsonate (5 cases), and other compounds (12 cases). Of the 44 exposures, 27 were unintentional, 7 were suicide attempts, 6 were homicide attempts, and 4 were of unknown intent. Of the 27 unintentionally exposed patients, 19 were black and 14 were male; their median age was 3 years. Of the 13 intentionally poisoned persons, 9 were male and 10 were black, with a median age of 28 years. Six of the seven patients who attempted suicide were white; four of the six victims of attempted homicide were black. We recommend removal of remaining bottles of arsenic-based rodenticides from store shelves, and we urge practicing physicians to warn patients of the dangers of using such rodenticides.\r"

  ".W": "Most patients with pancreatic carcinoma are not curable. Surgical palliation of obstructive jaundice and gastric outlet obstruction leaves many patients with severe pain from pancreatic carcinoma. Anesthesiologists have drawn increasing attention to the successful use of postoperative percutaneous celiac plexus block for the treatment of pancreatic pain. Ironically, little attention has been paid to celiac plexus block during laparotomy. We reviewed the cases of 12 patients with pancreatic carcinoma and severe abdominal pain who were treated surgically. All patients had operative celiac plexus block with absolute alcohol at the time of exploratory laparotomy for biliary bypass, gastroenterostomy, or tumor biopsy. Complete postoperative pain relief was obtained in 10 of the 12 patients; two had only partial relief. No operative complications were related to celiac plexus block; one patient died postoperatively of pneumonia. Average postoperative hospital stay was 13 days and average postoperative survival was 3 1/2 months. Most patients had excellent pain relief for at least 2 months or until death. Because most patients treated surgically for pancreatic carcinoma are receiving only palliation with biliary bypass or gastroenterostomy, surgeons should pay increased attention to pain relief. Operative celiac plexus block is easy, safe, and highly effective in relieving the agonizing pain of pancreatic carcinoma.\r"

Indications are distal metastatic disease, extensive local invasion, obstruction and bleeding from nonresectable rectal tumor, or refusal of surgery. From Jan 1, 1986, to Jan 1, 1989, I saw 26 patients who met those criteria; 19 already had metastatic disease and three repeatedly refused abdominoperineal resection. A two-laser approach using both CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers was used in patients with low-lying lesions; others were treated by the Nd:YAG laser only. For rectal tumors, bipolar esophageal tumor probes were used via the rigid sigmoidoscope. The number of laser sessions averaged three per patient, and the number of bipolar coagulation sessions averaged five per patient. Bleeding followed bipolar coagulation in one patient. There were no perforations in either treatment group, and no patient has required colostomy. Of the 19 patients who already had metastatic disease, 12 are still alive, the longest survival being 20 months. Of those medically unfit for surgery, three have died of coincidental disease, and one is alive with controlled rectal cancer after 16 months. All three patients who refused surgery are alive; the longest survival is 13 months.\r"

Patients with severe hypertension may require multiple agents for adequate control of blood pressure because of either poor control with one agent or side effects from high doses of a single agent. Laboratory investigations have shown a synergistic effect on receptor binding, as well as increased drug levels with the concurrent use of diltiazem and a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (nifedipine or nicardipine). It is as yet unknown whether these effects on receptor binding and increased drug levels translate into greater clinical efficacy in blood pressure control.

This organism, when isolated in pure culture, should not be dismissed as a contaminant, but must be considered a possible etiologic agent.

Labor, delivery, and puerperium were uncomplicated, and the newborn (though too premature to survive) was of appropriate weight for gestational age, without evidence of congenital heart disease or other anomalies. We believe this is the first report of pregnancy and spontaneous delivery in a patient who has had Fontan repair of a congenital heart defect.\r"

  ".W": "As the existence of a late reaction in exercise induced asthma is controversial, peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured for up to 13 hours after a running test in 404 consecutive young male army conscripts undergoing assessment of their asthma. In 294 subjects (73%) the immediate post-exercise fall in PEF was 10% or more; the mean (SD) fall in PEF in this group was 27% (15%). Nine patients with exercise induced asthma had a fall in PEF of 20% or more 4-13 hours after the exercise test. In these possible \"late responders,\" however, the change in PEF 4-13 hours after exercise was similar to the change in PEF on control days before and after the exercise day, and the lowest PEF during this period was similar to the lowest measurements on the control days. These nine subjects showed pre-exercise bronchodilatation. Their pre-exercise PEF, from which the percentage fall in PEF was calculated, was 24% (9%) higher than the mean PEF level on control days. This study supports the view that what appears to be a \"late asthmatic reaction\" after exercise is an artefact. Spontaneous within day fluctuation in pulmonary function, pre-exercise bronchodilatation, and the fact that airflow obstruction persists after the early postexercise response may give a false impression of an exercise induced late asthmatic response in patients with labile airways.\r"

  ".U": "91195950\r", 
  ".W": "The association between inhaled fenoterol and death from asthma has been investigated further by studying 112 asthma deaths (cases) during 1981-7 in patients aged 5-45 years who had been admitted to a major hospital for asthma during the 12 months before death. Two age matched control groups were chosen. Control group A comprised 427 patients who had been admitted to hospital for asthma during the calendar year that the corresponding death occurred and who had also had a previous admission for asthma in the previous 12 months. Control group B comprised 448 patients admitted to hospital for asthma during the calendar year in which the admission of the corresponding case occurred. The inhaled fenoterol odds ratio was 2.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-3.23, p less than 0.01) when group A was used as the control (the approach used in previous studies), and 2.66 (95% CI 1.74-4.06, p less than 0.01) with group B as the control (the approach recommended by critics of previous studies). Markers of chronic asthma severity were associated with asthma death when control group B was used, but not when control group A was used (which indicates that these markers were indirectly matched for when control group A was used). Information was also collected on various markers of acute asthma severity and prescription of psychotropic drugs, but it was found that these were not important confounders. These findings address the major criticisms of previous case-control studies of this issue, and add support to the hypothesis that inhaled fenoterol increases the risk of death in patients with severe asthma.\r"

  ".W": "Scotland has high rates of death from diseases of the respiratory system and high rates of smoking, especially among women. Data on self reported smoking and prevalence of chronic cough and chronic phlegm among 10,359 men and women aged 40-59 years were obtained from the Scottish Heart Health Study. Overall, current cigarette smokers had rates of chronic cough and chronic phlegm four to five times those of never smokers after standardisation for age (32.3% v 6.5% for men and 24% v 5.5% for women for chronic cough; 31% v 8.3% for men and 21% v 5.5% for women for chronic phlegm). Ex-smokers' symptom rates were a little above those of never smokers and were significant for chronic cough among women and chronic phlegm among men. Men had higher symptom rates than women and this was true for smokers, ex-smokers, and never smokers. The higher rates among men could not be explained by higher cotinine concentrations. Tests to detect \"deceivers\" among ex-smokers and never smokers using biochemical validation suggested that 87 (1.5%) respondents were in fact smoking; they were excluded from analyses. There were substantially lower rates of chronic cough and chronic phlegm within a year of stopping smoking, and two to four years after stopping 89-99% of the difference between current smokers and never smokers was accounted for (99% and 93% for men and women with chronic cough, 96% and 89% for men and women with chronic phlegm). Even 10 years after stopping, rates of symptoms among ex-smokers remained a little above those of never smokers (except for women with chronic phlegm), though these differences were not statistically significant. Former heavy smokers continued to have rates of chronic cough and chronic phlegm that were higher than those of former light and moderate smokers (though not significantly so). These are cross sectional data, but they emphasise the importance for chronic bronchitis symptoms of giving up cigarette smoking, though the amount previously smoked continues to exert a small influence.\r"

The aim of the study was to determine the branching pattern of respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts in a human acinus from the peripheral part of the lung, where space constraints may have affected airway branching patterns. The lungs were obtained from an 18 year old victim of a motor vehicle accident and fixed in inflation under a pressure of 25 cm H2O. A block was cut from the lower edge of the right lower lobe and embedded in plastic. Serial sections were cut and the branching pattern of airways subtended by a terminal bronchiole were followed. The acinus was bounded on two sides by pleura and on the remaining sides by connective tissue septa. The terminal bronchiole divided into two respiratory bronchioles, each of which gave rise to four systems of alveolar ducts. Between successive systems of alveolar ducts the respiratory bronchioles continued as single airways, becoming progressively more alveolated towards the periphery but not subtending further branches of respiratory bronchioles. The duct systems became less complex towards the periphery, near to the edge of the lung. The total volume of the acinus was similar to that found in previous studies. This branching pattern has not been described previously in a human acinus.\r"

The central hypothesis, that excessive drying of the airway surfaces is a primary event that leads to all the manifestations of the respiratory insufficiency in cystic fibrosis, is not proved. The hypothesis is, however, consistent with the known transporting abnormalities and is strengthened by the modest clinical improvement produced by a strategy designed to correct the transporting abnormalities. The discovery of the cystic fibrosis gene, together with the presumed structure of the protein product, provides a focal point that must eventually connect the functional abnormalities with the genetic defect. The cellular function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator must now be the major target in research on cystic fibrosis. Strategies for treatment based on known cellular and molecular abnormalities are beginning to emerge but will be undoubtedly more focused once the responsibility of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator is known.\r"

Signals normally displayed include oxygen saturation, airflow, chest wall motion, electroencephalogram, and electrooculogram; but others can be recorded if desired. The information is displayed on a timebase appropriate for the recognition and analysis of respiratory events during sleep. In addition, use is made of normally invisible video lines to record the analogue voltage waveforms so that on replay this information can be displayed on a fast timebase for analysing the more rapidly changing waveforms of electrophysiological signals. The system allows detailed polysomnography to be performed in the normal ward setting with the subject monitored overnight by the nursing staff. Subsequent analysis of the synchronised video, audio, and analogue signals allows measurement of the conventional indices obtained by polysomnography and aids their interpretation.\r"

  ".W": "One thousand and one men, aged 35-65 years, were identified from the age-sex register of one group general practice. Over four years 900 men were visited at home and asked questions about symptoms potentially related to sleep apnoea and snoring. Height, weight, neck circumference, resting arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), and spirometric values were also determined. All night oximetry was then performed at home and the tracing analysed for the number of dips in SaO2 of more than 4%. Subjects with more than five dips of 4% SaO2 or more per hour were invited for sleep laboratory polysomnography. Seventeen per cent of the men admitted to snoring \"often.\" Multiple linear regression techniques identified and ranked neck circumference (r2 = 7.2%), cigarette consumption (r2 = 3.4%), and nasal stuffiness (r2 = 2%) as the only significant independent predictors of snoring. Together these account for at least a sixfold variation in the likelihood of being an \"often\" snorer. Forty six subjects (5%) had greater than 4% SaO2 dip rates of over five an hour and 31 of these had full sleep studies. Three subjects had clinically obvious and severe symptomatic obstructive sleep apnoea, giving a prevalence of three per 1001 men (0.3%; 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.9%). Eighteen men had obstructive sleep apnoea only when supine and in 10 the cause of the SaO2 dipping on the original home tracing was not elucidated. The greater than 4% SaO2 dip rates correlated with the history of snoring. Multiple linear regression techniques identified and ranked neck circumference (r2 = 7.9%), alcohol consumption (r2 = 3.7%), age (r2 = 1%) and obesity (r2 = 1%) as the only significant independent predictors of the rate of overnight hypoxic dipping. This study shows that snoring in this randomly selected population correlates best with neck size, smoking, and nasal stuffiness. Obstructive sleep apnoea, defined by nocturnal hypoxaemia, correlates best with neck size and alcohol, and less so with age and general obesity.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma tumour necrosis factor alpha (alpha) concentration is increased in acute Gram negative sepsis, but the effect of chronic infection on plasma concentrations is unknown. A study was carried out in patients with cystic fibrosis to determine the effect of chronic lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the plasma concentration of tumour necrosis factor and two other indicators of the inflammatory response, circulating C reactive protein and neutrophil elastase-alpha 1 antiproteinase complex (elastase complex). The concentration of immunoreactive tumour necrosis factor in plasma was greater than the upper 95% confidence interval for healthy subjects (2.6 U/ml) on 129 out of 189 occasions in 14 patients observed for about a year. The increase in tumour necrosis factor was associated with increased circulating C reactive protein and elastase complex. Twelve patients with an exacerbation of respiratory symptoms were studied before and after two weeks' treatment with anti-pseudomonal antibiotics. All three indicators of the inflammatory response fell after treatment, though median tumour necrosis factor (4.8 U/ml) and elastase complex (0.41 microgram/ml) concentrations remained above the upper limits for healthy subjects. During a period of clinical stability plasma tumour necrosis factor was increased in 10 of the 12 patients, elastase complex was increased in 10 of the 12, and C reactive protein was increased in seven. Increased plasma immunoreactive tumour necrosis factor was a feature of the near continuous inflammatory response to chronic P aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis and may be a factor contributing to the progressive lung destruction seen in this disease.\r"

Both procedures were effective in identifying prostate cancer; complete sensitivity was 94 percent for aspiration and 90 percent for core biopsy. Aspiration confirmed 87 percent of 38 known cancers and 94 percent of 81 cancers overall, compared with 82 percent and 90 percent with core biopsies. The greatest number of cancers was found when both procedures were considered (95% of known and 98% of all cancers). Grading of both specimens was performed but was not equivalent. Unsatisfactory or inconclusive results by either procedure often obtained when cancer was present. We suggest digital transrectal needle aspiration as a first means of identifying most palpable prostate lesions. Transrectal core biopsies guided by ultrasonography should be used when suspicion of cancer cannot be confirmed by aspiration and when there is no palpable lesion (but clinical suspicion of cancer).\r"

This study examined nephrostomy urine specimens, finding no significant excretion of prostate-specific antigen into the renal pelvic urine. Similarly, no significant lowering of serum prostate-specific antigen levels occurred during routine hemodialysis in men with chronic renal failure, nor were ambulatory, pre-dialysis serum prostate-specific antigen levels in these same men with chronic renal failure elevated. It appears unlikely that the kidney plays a significant role in the clearance of prostate-specific antigen from human serum.\r"

Because the drug also has been reported to be a competitive inhibitor of oxalate excretion by the renal tubules, we sought to determine whether chronic use indeed affected the amount of oxalate excreted. Patients taking hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg daily did not have a statistically significant reduction in twenty-four-hour urinary oxalate on their customary diets (pretreatment 37 +/- 3 mg/day [mean +/- S.E.M.; N = 22]; at one year 36 +/- 3 mg/day [N = 22]; at two years 37 +/- 3 mg/day [N = 16]). In 12 patients who voluntarily collected twelve-hour urine specimens after dinner on the third day of a low-oxalate diet and again the next day after a 1 g oxalate load, hydrochlorothiazide had no significant effect on oxalate excretion (19 +/- 2.3 mmol oxalate/mol creatinine on hydrochlorothiazide versus 20.6 +/- 2.6 mmol off the drug after low oxalate meal; 50 +/- 7.8 mmol/mol creatinine on hydrochlorothiazide versus 56.2 +/- 7.5 mmol off the drug after an oxalate load). As expected, there was a significant reduction in urinary calcium excretion and thus of calcium oxalate urinary saturation during hydrochlorothiazide administration. Hydrochlorothiazide by itself is not sufficient to reduce oxalate excretion in patients with renal leak hypercalciuria.\r"

The percutaneous nephrostomy provided adequate relief of obstruction in the face of significant azotemia or infection. Diagnostic abilities were improved through the use of antegrade pyelography, selective cytologic examination, and, at times, by providing direct access for endoscopic visualization and biopsy. In select cases, the percutaneous access provided a route for definitive or adjunctive treatment of the lesion. Complications were few and seeding of the tract or local tumor spread has not occurred at follow-up ranging from one to one hundred twenty-one (mean 27.8) months.\r"

A good interobserver reproducibility was found in 19 measurements. Urinary flow rates, EF, and RU showed a highly significant statistical difference between normal individuals and patients before surgery: AFR, 9.2 +/- 5.1 vs. 2.9 +/- 1.5 mL/sec; PFR, 19.5 +/- 9.2 vs 7.4 +/- 3.2 mL/sec; CPFR, 1.17 +/- 0.34 vs 0.54 +/- 0.22; EF, 95.6 +/- 4.6 vs 68.2 +/- 23.2 percent; and RU, 11.8 +/- 15.8 vs 93.4 +/- 115 mL; respectively. After prostatectomy the urinary flow rates showed a highly significant improvement and did not differ from the normal individuals: AFR, 7.9 +/- 2.7 mL/sec; PFR, 19.0 +/- 6.4 mL/sec; and CPFR, 1.32 +/- 0.57. The EF after surgery (91.7 +/- 10.9%) was lower than in normal individuals, but showed a significant improvement compared with EF before surgery. The RU after surgery (27.4 +/- 48.0 mL) although lower than before surgery did not differ significantly and was greater than in the normal individuals. No relationship between age and flow was found in this study. Both average and peak flow rates were related to the bladder volume. This method involves a single, noninvasive procedure which enables determination of bladder-emptying function.\r"

However, REC 15/2053 displayed greater activity in the detrusor than in the other tissues. The relaxant effect on the prostatic tissues suggests a potential use for these compounds in benign prostatic obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "Clear cell cribriform hyperplasia (CCCH) of the prostate is an unusual form of benign prostatic hyperplasia characterized by a nodular proliferation of clear cells with small, uniform nuclei. The authors studied 15 cases of CCCH by immunohistochemistry and 13 of them by DNA flow cytometry to establish the immunohistochemical and DNA profile of this lesion. Patients ranged in age from 58 to 88 years (mean, 68 years). Follow-up of a mean of 22 months showed all patients alive with no evidence of malignant prostatic disease. All 13 CCCHs showed diploid DNA content; in contrast, among 4 papillary/cribriform carcinomas of the prostate used for comparison, 3 were aneuploid and 1 was diploid. A basal cell layer was demonstrated in all 15 CCCHs by the use of the 34 beta E12 anti-high-molecular-weight keratin antibody (EAB-903) that reacts with the basal cells but not with the acinar cells of the prostate. A continuous basal cell layer was not evident in the carcinomas. The blandness of the epithelium, the well-defined nodular configuration, the presence of a basal cell layer demonstrable by immunocytochemistry, and the lack of aneuploidy as determined by DNA flow cytometry together lend support to the concept that CCCH is a benign lesion.\r"

Recent reports, however, have suggested that this antibody may cross-react with a small number of carcinomas and other epithelial cells. The authors tested the hypothesis that these latter reports represent examples of false-positive immunostaining by comparing the immunostaining on breast, salivary gland, and lung tumors with the following: (1) a commercial ascites preparation of this monoclonal antibody; (2) a protein A-purified antibody preparation derived from ascites fluid; and (3) supernatant fluid obtained from the hybridoma cell line. The authors found that all examples of nonmelanoma immunostaining in the carcinomas tested were eliminated with the nonascites fluid preparations, whereas strong immunostaining of melanomas was retained. The authors conclude that contaminated commercial ascites fluid preparations of HMB45 may account for most, if not all, of the reports of nonmelanoma immunostaining with HMB45.\r"

  ".W": "DNA ploidy and cell cycle analyses are being used with increasing frequency as additional, sometimes independent, biologic prognosticators of various malignancies. For obvious reasons, most of the large studies published are retrospective, using archival paraffin-embedded tissues likely to have been fixed and processed differently. To assess the effect of various fixation conditions on ploidy analyses, the authors performed a comprehensive study in which five contiguous aliquots from 26 tissue samples were fixed in formalin for 8. 24, and 48 hours; B5; and the ethanol-based fixative Omnifix (Omni, Xenetics Biomed Inc., Irvine, CA), respectively. The samples were prepared and stained with the use of Hedley's method; the DNA analyses were done with a Coulter EPICS V flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL); and the resulting histograms were interpreted with Multicycle software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). Mean channels and coefficients of variation (CVs) of the G0/G1 peaks were compared. Increasing fixation times in formalin produced slight shifting to the left on the G0/G1 peaks with differences up to 13 channels. Omni caused similar but more conspicuous changes, with maximal shifting of 51 channels. B5 created the opposite effect, with right-shifted G0/G1 peaks up to 22 channels. The CVs deteriorated progressively with increasing fixation times in formalin. B5 and Omni fixatives conferred the worse histograms, with 6 and 15 cases, respectively, displaying CVs greater than 8. Such significant differences preclude the use of any other internal standard but adjacent normal tissue that was processed exactly the same as the tumor. The validity of DNA results obtained otherwise should be considered questionable. These findings may explain some of the previously published controversial reports and emphasize the need to use an internal standard and more stringent criteria to define aneuploidy in paraffin-embedded tissue.\r"

Of nine genital tract lesions in children. HPV 2 was detected in two and HPV 6 or 11 in six. More than 90% of cases of regional tract condylomata in adults contained HPV 6 or 11. HPV 2 was not detected in any of 99 genital tract lesions in adults. It is concluded that HPV 6/11 cannot proliferate at nongenital cutaneous sites and HPV 2 can proliferate in the genital tract of children but not adults. Thus, the detection of HPV 6 or 11 in a genital wart in a child implies, assuming cutaneous transmission, infection from a genital site, whereas the detection of HPV 2 presumes nongenital transmission.\r"

HPV DNA types usually have been identified by nucleic acid hybridization assays with the use of radiolabeled probes. These techniques are sensitive and specific but are not suitable for large-scale clinical use. To detect specific HPV DNAs simply and rapidly, in situ hybridization (ISH) with the use of biotinylated HPV DNA 6/11 and 16/18 probes was done on destained Papanicolaou's (Pap) smears from 545 patients. All smears showed koilocytotic changes. HPV DNAs were demonstrated not only in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and atypia, but also in squamous cells with minimal nuclear changes (karyomegaly) and perinuclear halos. HPV DNA 16/18 was detected in 52% of the smears with CIN I, 44% of those with CIN II and III, 19% of those with atypia, and 4% of the minimal changes. HPV DNA 6/11 was detected in 27% of the smears with CIN I, 27% of those with atypia, and 6% of the minimal changes. HPV DNAs were also detected in smears without koilocytotic changes. Thus, ISH with the use of biotinylated probes can serve as an adjunct to Pap smears in detecting HPV infection.\r"

This case differs from the previously reported single case of isolated thyroid pneumocystosis in the presence of a rapidly enlarging neck mass, lack of previous Pneumocystis, and prior prophylaxis with aerosolized pentamidine. The pathologic and electron microscopic description of the peculiar flocculent necrotic thyroid material is contrasted with typical pulmonary alveolar findings in Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), the differential diagnoses of a rapidly expanding neck mass, and diagnostic difficulties of hypothyroidism in patients with AIDS are discussed.

Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells had abundant desmosomes, numerous tonofilament bundles, and variable-length microvilli. These findings confirm the mesothelial nature of the cells. Features consistent with malignancy included DNA aneuploidy by flow cytometric analysis and diffuse peritoneal involvement. The three previously described survivors with MPM were also premenarchal girls. Some MPMs in premenarchal girls have an indolent biologic behavior similar to that of low-grade peritoneal serous neoplasia or well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma in adult women.\r"

All cases were Sudan black or myeloperoxidase negative and met French-American-British (FAB) morphologic criteria for ALL. Granular ALL, characterized by the presence of more than 5% marrow blasts with at least three clearly defined azurophilic cytoplasmic granules, was identified in 56 of the 1,252 fully studied cases (4.5%). The frequency of granular features did not differ among early pre-B (4.3%), pre-B (3.6%), and T (5.8%) ALL; no cases were identified among the 12 patients with B ALL. Within the early pre-B/pre-B group, granular ALL was equally distributed between good- and poor-risk clinical groups but was more frequent among FAB L2 than FAB L1 cases (12% vs. 2%; P less than or equal to 0.001). Patients were treated with standard POG protocols for early pre-B/pre-B and T ALL. Complete remission (CR) rates were significantly lower for those with granular lymphoblasts, regardless of risk group, immunophenotype, or FAB type. Analysis of event-free survival (EFS) showed a significantly poorer outcome for granular early pre-B/pre-B cases with FAB L2 morphologic characteristics (P less than 0.001) and for those classified as poor risk (P = 0.015). These findings suggest a relationship between granules and L2 morphologic characteristics in childhood ALL and indicate that the presence of granular lymphoblasts conveys a worse prognosis for certain subgroups of children with ALL.\r"

Typical adult T-cell leukemia/lymphomas (ATLLs) from nine patients were positive for HTLV-I sequences. In contrast, one of two lymphomas with immunophenotypes atypical for ATLL was negative for HTLV-I. This HTLV-I DNA-negative lymphoma, although present in an HTLV-I-seropositive patient, was therefore reclassified. The HTLV-I tax gene was always detected in the ATLL tissues, whereas segments of the pol gene were not detected in half the cases. These studies demonstrate that fixed non-ATLL specimens can be distinguished from ATLL specimens.\r"

  ".W": "Malignant lymphoma, diffuse, mixed small and large cell type, as defined in the Working Formulation, is heterogeneous both morphologically and immunophenotypically and, in some cases, clonality may be difficult to determine. Because gene rearrangement analysis has been shown to be a sensitive method for determining clonality, the authors genotyped 20 cases and compared the results with histologic and immunophenotypic findings. Immunophenotypic studies demonstrated that all lesions were composed predominantly of T cells. In addition, in eight cases either a monoclonal B-cell population (five lesions) or an aberrant immunophenotype (two T, one B) was detected, supporting a malignant diagnosis. In seven of these eight lymphomas, genotypic analysis confirmed the presence of a population of clonal cells. One case with an abnormal T-cell phenotype was germline. In 12 cases the immunophenotypic results were uncertain (i.e., no clonal population or abnormal immunophenotype was identified). Genotypic analysis provided evidence of clonality in eight. In four cases with uncertain immunophenotypic results, a clonal population also could not be identified with the use of Southern blot analysis. Thus, the authors conclude that gene rearrangement analysis is a valuable tool in the study of diffuse mixed cell lymphomas and is complementary to immunophenotypic studies. In addition, the authors analyzed the major breakpoint region of the bcl-2 protooncogene on chromosome 18, either by Southern blot analysis and/or with the polymerase chain reaction. The authors identified the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation in seven B-cell lymphomas, five of which were not considered to be of follicular center cell type on the basis of morphologic findings. These results suggest that the histologic spectrum of follicular center cell lymphomas is greater than is appreciated in the literature.\r"

Platelet counts were normal in nine patients and decreased in six. Blasts comprised less than 5% of cells in 40% of the biopsies, ranged from 5-15% in 53%, and comprised more than 30% of cells in 7%. Numerous small hypo- and hyperlobated megakaryocytes were seen in all specimens, often occurring in clusters, and were more easily seen in sections than in smears. Subsequent biopsies in 13 patients showed a remission marrow in seven, increased blasts in three, and AML in three; none showed AMH. AMH resembling acute megakaryoblastic leukemia may be seen transiently after treatment of AML.\r"

Recent reports indicate that identification of foamy alveolar casts (FACs) with Papanicolaou's (Pap) stain may provide a sensitive and less complicated way of making the diagnosis. To confirm these observations, results on a series of 318 BALs were reviewed. PC was identified on 65 (20%) specimens from 54 patients. Pap stains and GMS stains were positive on 56 (86%) of these BALs. Pap stains were positive on seven (11%) specimens that had negative GMS stains. PC was later confirmed on these specimens by other methods. Only two (3%) BALs had positive GMS stains and negative Pap stains. The results of this study confirm other reports that show that PC can be sensitively diagnosed with the Pap stain. The authors suggest that routine special stains for PC are unnecessary on BALs.\r"

Throat swabs from patients with acute pharyngitis were cultured with the use of a single swab to inoculate each of the three plates in a specific order, rotating in three-week cycles. Plates were examined (each medium by a different technologist) after 24 and 48 hours of incubation at 35 degrees C in 5% carbon dioxide, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were serogrouped with the use of coagglutination. The positivity rate was significantly greater for SI (25%) and SA (26%) than for CB (18%) (P less than 0.001). The respective rates of Group A streptococcal detection by SI, SA, and CB were 91%, 95%, and 67%, respectively. However, a feature associated with the use of SI or SA, in contrast to CB, was delayed identification of isolates by 24-48 hours because of small colony size, slower growth rate, and inability to serogroup colonies taken directly from primary culture plates. Recovery of non-Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci occurred with CB (12%) greater than SI (8%) greater than SA (6%). SI is superior to a nonselective medium, such as CB, and is equal to SA for recovery of Group A streptococci from throat cultures.\r"

A progressive multiorgan involvement appeared in the course of the disease, and histopathological investigation demonstrated mitochondrial myopathy features with ragged red fibers. A defect of oxidative phosphorylation was found in both skeletal muscle and lymphocytes. It is surprising that various mtDNA deletions were detected both in the proband and in his healthy mother and maternal aunt but not in the rest of the maternal progeny. All the deletions were located between Cox II and cytochrome b genes, and short (4-5 bp) repeated sequences were consistently present at the boundaries of the rearrangements in different tissues. Therefore, the deletions appear not to be transmitted per se but to be inherited in a Mendelian manner, being possibly dominant. Both the Mendelian inheritance of the trait and the variety of the deletions in carriers suggest that a nuclearly encoded factor(s) might be involved in the triggering of the deletions. However, the presence of the rearrangements in healthy individuals raises the question of whether mtDNA deletions actually cause the clinical expression of the disease.\r"

It has been suggested that mtDNA might be the site of some of the mutations causing a group of human disorders called the \"mitochondrial myopathies,\" because these may both be (1) accompanied by defects in the electron transport chain and (2) display a maternal pattern of inheritance. However, all of the deletions and duplications of mtDNA which occur in these patients have been sporadic, apart from families in whom affected members all carry different deletions suggesting a mutant autosomal dominantly inherited nuclear gene with de novo deletions in each individual. We present the first evidence for the presence of deleted mtDNAs in the germ line in these disorders. The patient carries a higher level of deleted mtDNAs than do his relatives, corresponding to severity of symptoms and consistent with a predicted dosage effect. \"Selfishness\" of deleted mtDNAs is probably one of the factors over and above random segregation of a small number of \"founder\" mtDNAs (the bottleneck hypothesis) which may be invoked to explain the usual distribution of mtDNAs in different tissues of patients with mtDNA deletions.\r"

Additions to the models are (1) possible somatic mosaicism in a parent in some families, (2) the possibility that the parental origin of the mutation may or may not be known, and (3) mutation rates which change as a function of sex and/or time. The models indicate that recurrence risks are most critically affected by (a) the amount of somatic mosaicism which can be tolerated in the parent without manifesting disease and (b) knowledge of the parental origin of the mutation. In addition, there is a moderate effect on recurrence risks if mutation rates increase in the father as a function of time. Recurrence risks are at least as large as the risk of trisomy 21 in a child of a mother of age 35 years or older, probably much higher (5%-10%) when the mutation is known to be of maternal origin or if substantial somatic mosaicism in the parent is compatible with a normal phenotype. The recurrence risk of a new mutation is high because of a very high ascertainment bias of families with substantial germ-line mosaicism.\r"

  ".U": "91196723\r", 
  ".W": "VNTR loci provide valuable information for a number of fields of study involving human genetics, ranging from forensics (DNA fingerprinting and paternity testing) to linkage analysis and population genetics. Alleles of a VNTR locus are simply fragments obtained from a particular portion of the DNA molecule and are defined in terms of their length. The essential element of a VNTR fragment is the repeat, which is a short sequence of basepairs. The core of the fragment is composed of a variable number of identical repeats that are linked in tandem. A sample of fragments from a population of individuals exhibits substantial variation in length because of variation in the number of repeats. Each distinct fragment length defines an allele, but any given fragment is measured with error. Therefore the observed distribution of fragment lengths is not discrete but is continuous, and determination of distinct allele classes is not straightforward. A mixture model is the natural statistical method for estimating the allele frequencies of VNTR loci. In this article we develop nonparametric methods for obtaining the distribution of allele sizes and estimates of their frequencies. Methods for obtaining maximum-likelihood estimates are developed. In addition, we suggest an empirical Bayes method to improve the maximum-likelihood estimates of the gene frequencies; the empirical Bayes procedure effects a local smoothing. The latter method works particularly well when measurement error is large relative to the repeat size, because the estimated distribution of allele frequencies when maximum likelihood is used is unreliable because of an alternating pattern of over- and underestimation. We define alleles and estimate the allele frequencies for two VNTR loci from the human genome (D17S79 and D2S44), from data obtained from Lifecodes, Inc.\r"

An allele encoding an inactive form of the mitochondrial ALDH2 is known to reduce the likelihood of alcoholism in Japanese. We hypothesized that the polymorphisms of both ALDH and ADH modify the predisposition to development of alcoholism. Therefore, we determined the genotypes of the ADH2, ADH3, and ALDH2 loci of alcoholic and nonalcoholic Chinese men living in Taiwan, using leukocyte DNA amplified by the PCR and allele-specific oligonucleotides. The alcoholics had significantly lower frequencies of the ADH2*2, ADH3*1, and ALDH2*2 alleles than did the nonalcoholics, suggesting that genetic variation in both ADH and ALDH, by modulating the rate of metabolism of ethanol and acetaldehyde, influences drinking behavior and the risk of developing alcoholism.\r"

Six phenotypic or physiologic characteristics were assessed: (1) birth weight, (2) height percentile at time of testing, (3) presence of a webbed neck, (4) cardiovascular abnormalities, (5) renal abnormalities, and (6) thyroid autoimmunity. There were no significant differences in birth weights or heights between the girls who retained the maternal X or the paternal X.

In this locus in the mouse, a gene, termed the \"formin\" gene, has been identified which encodes an array of differentially processed transcripts in both adult and embryonic tissues. A set of these transcripts are disrupted in independent mutant mouse ld alleles. We wish to report the isolation of a human genomic clone which is homologous to the mouse formin gene by virtue of sequence comparison and expression of conserved exons. Among human fetal tissues analyzed, the kidney appears to be a major site of expression. This human gene, LD, maps to chromosome 15q11----qter in mouse human somatic cell hybrids and, specifically, to 15q13----q14 by chromosomal in situ hybridization. This localization establishes both LD and beta 2-microglobulin as syntenic genes on mouse chromosome 2 and human chromosome 15 and implies the interspecies conservation of the region between them. In addition, we identify in the human locus two frequently occurring DNA polymorphisms which can be used to test the linkage of LD to known human dysmorphoses.\r"

First, in situ hybridizations were performed with metaphase chromosomes from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. In three separate experiments using two different regions of human elastin cDNAs, the distribution of grains was found to be concentrated on the long arm of chromosome 7 within the [q11.1-21.1] region, and the peak number of grains coincided with the locus 7q11.2. Second, hybridizations with a panel of human-rodent cell hybrids showed concordance with human chromosome 7. Third, PCR analyses with elastin-specific primers of DNA from a hybrid cell line containing chromosome 7 as the only human chromosome yielded a product of the expected size, while DNA containing human chromosome 2, but not chromosome 7, did not result in a product. The results indicate that the human elastin gene is located in the proximal region of the long arm of chromosome 7. The precise localization of the elastin gene in the human genome is useful in establishing genetic linkage between inheritance of an allele with a mutated elastin gene and a heritable disorder.\r"

The blood tyrosine level was persistently high, and increased amounts of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid and its derivatives were excreted into the urine. Succinylacetone was not detected in urine samples from these mice. All the animals were apparently healthy, and there was no evidence of hepatorenal dysfunction. The hypertyrosinemia was transmitted through an autosomal recessive inheritance. Analyses of hepatic enzymes related to tyrosine metabolism revealed that 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase activity was virtually absent, while fumarylacetoacetase and tyrosine aminotransferases (cytosolic and mitochondrial forms) were normal in these mutant mice. Immunoblot analysis of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase protein in the liver indicated that the subunit protein of the enzyme was absent. It would appear that hypertyrosinemia in this mutant strain was caused by a genetic defect in 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase. These features are similar to type III tyrosinemia in humans. Analysis of this mutant strain of mouse is expected to provide valuable information on the pathogenesis of human type III tyrosinemia and can also serve as a useful system for studies on tyrosine metabolism.\r"

In one 3-generation family of 15 individuals, we show here that the high-CYP1A1-inducibility phenotype segregates concordantly with an infrequent polymorphic site located 450 bases downstream from the CYP1A1 gene. Our findings are consistent with the study of Kawajiri et al., who demonstrated an association between this polymorphism and an increased incidence of squamous-cell lung cancer. Our data suggest that the CYP1A1 structural gene, or a region near this gene, might be correlated with the inducibility phenotype.\r"

Candidate clones were partially sequenced to verify the presence of zinc finger-encoding regions; nonoverlapping cDNA clones were chosen on the basis of sequences and genomic hybridization pattern. Zinc finger structure-encoding clones, which were designated by the term \"Kox\" and a number from 1 to 32 and which were apparently unique (i.e., distinct from each other and distinct from those isolated by other laboratories), were chosen for mapping in the human genome. DNAs from rodent-human somatic cell hybrids retaining defined complements of human chromosomes were analyzed for the presence of each of the Kox genes. Correlation between the presence of specific human chromosome regions and specific Kox genes established the chromosomal locations. Multiple Kox loci were mapped to 7q (Kox 18 and 25 and a locus detected by both Kox 8 cDNA and Kox 27 cDNA), 8q24 5' to the myc locus (Kox 9 and 32), 10cen----q24 (Kox 2, 15, 19, 21, 30, and 31), 12q13-qter (Kox 1 and 20), 17p13 (Kox 11 and 26), and 19q (Kox 5, 6, 10, 22, 24, and 28).

Several of the Kox loci map to regions in which other zinc finger structure-encoding loci have already been localized, indicating possible zinc finger gene clusters. In addition, Kox genes at 8q24, 17p13, and 22q11--and perhaps other Kox genes--are located near recurrent chromosomal translocation breakpoints. Others, such as those on 7p and 7q, may be near regions specifically active in T cells.\r"

Among six markers mapping to this region, five were shown to be linked with the SMA locus in 39 chronic SMA families each containing at least two affected individuals. Multilocus analysis by the method of location score was used to establish the best estimate of the SMA gene location. Our data suggest that the most likely location for SMA is between loci D5S6 and D5S39. The genetic distances between these two markers are estimated to be 6.4 cM in males and 11.9 cM in females. Since meiosis were informative with D5S39 and D5S6 in 92% and 87% of SMA families, respectively, it is hoped that the present study will contribute to the calculation of genetic risk in SMA families.\r"

One case possessed two markers, one derived from chromosome 6, and one derived from the X. The mechanism of generation of ring marker chromosomes is discussed. Five of seven cases who could be phenotypically assessed were abnormal. Three of these--the first with a ring chromosome derived from chromosome 1; the second with two markers, one derived from chromosome 6 and the other from the X chromosome; and the third with a ring chromosome derived from chromosome 20--each possessed distinctive facies.

The 22q+ marker appeared as a dicentric: 22 pter----q11::1p11----qter. The reciprocal product of this translocation has presumably been lost because it lacked a centromere. The 22q- chromosome also appeared to have lost sequences distal to band q11. We assumed that this marker could have been the result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 4 and 22. To investigate the 4p+ and 22q- chromosomes in more detail, human-hamster somatic cell hybrids were constructed that segregated the 22q- and 4p+ chromosomes. Southern blot analysis with DNA from these hybrids showed that sequences from 22q were indeed translocated to 4p+ and that reciprocally sequences from 4p were translocated to 22q-, demonstrating a balanced t(4;22)(p16;q11). On the basis of these results we presume that in this tumor a tumor-suppressor gene is deleted in the case of the 22q+ marker and that the t(4;22) disrupts the second allele of this gene. The latter translocation was mapped between D22S1 and D22S15, a distance of 1 cM on the linkage map of this chromosome. The area in which we have located the translocation is within the region where the gene predisposing to neurofibromatosis 2 has been mapped.\r"

On the basis of 10 years of Maryland newborn-screening data, we found the frequency to be 1/50,000, or one-third that in whites. We performed haplotype analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene of 36 U.S. blacks, 16 from individuals with classical PKU and 20 from controls. In blacks, 20% of wild-type PAH alleles have a common Caucasian haplotype (i.e., haplotype 1), whereas 80% had a variety of haplotypes, all rare in Caucasians and Asians. One of these, haplotype 15, accounted for a large fraction (30%). Among black mutant PAH alleles, 20% have a haplotype (i.e., either haplotype 1 or haplotype 4) common in Caucasians; 40% have a haplotype rare in Caucasians and Asians, and 40% have one of two previously undescribed haplotypes. Both can be derived from known haplotypes by a single event. One of these haplotypes is characterized by a new MspI restriction site, located in intron 8, which was present in five of 16 black mutant alleles but was not present in 60 U.S. black control, 20 U.S. Caucasian control, or 20 Caucasian mutant PAH alleles. Sequence analysis of DNA from a single individual, homozygous for the new MspI associated haplotype, shows homozygosity for a C----T transition at nucleotide 896 in exon 7 of the PAH cDNA, resulting in the conversion of leucine 255 to serine (L255S).\r"

The mutation in type I is a guanine-to-adenine substitution in codon 57 of exon 3 of the NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase gene, and the sense of this codon is changed from arginine to glutamine. In type III the mutation is a thymine-to-cytosine transition in codon 148 of exon 5, causing leucine-to-proline replacement in type III. The former mutation abolishes the MspI recognition site. Homozygosity for the former mutation in a patient with type I was confirmed by restriction analysis of PCR-amplified fragments and by dot blot hybridization of amplified products with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes. The latter mutation generates a recognition site for MspI. Amplification of exon 5 by PCR followed by digestion with MspI revealed homozygosity for this mutation in patients with type-III.

Ritodrine plasma concentrations at steady state were comparable in both groups and averaged 18 ng/ml. Animals receiving ritodrine pulses demonstrated no alteration of myometrial beta-adrenergic receptors or adenylyl cyclase activity, and ritodrine inhibited oxytocin-induced contractility comparably at 4 and 24 hours. Animals receiving ritodrine continuously had a significant decrease in myometrial beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylyl cyclase activity, yet ritodrine inhibition of oxytocin-induced uterine contractility was sustained for 24 hours. Oxytocin receptors were not affected by ritodrine administration and were similar in both groups. At the dose studied, oxytocin-induced contractions are comparably inhibited by ritodrine for 24 hours whether the drug is given continuously or in a pulsatile fashion.\r"

  ".W": "Recently an intramembranous pathway was reported in the ovine fetus as a route for the movement of a significant volume of water from the amniotic cavity directly into the fetal blood, which perfuses the fetal membranes and fetal surface of the placenta. To test whether this pathway could be an avenue for the movement of arginine vasopressin from the amniotic cavity into the fetal circulation, we injected 1 to 25 micrograms of arginine vasopressin into the amniotic cavity of two groups of chronically catheterized fetal sheep: a control group of seven animals and a group of seven animals with surgical ligation of the fetal esophagus. We found similar and highly significant increases of arginine vasopressin concentrations in both control and surgically ligated fetuses in amniotic fluid (p less than 0.00001), fetal plasma (p less than 0.0001), and fetal urine (p less than 0.0001). Both groups had similar increases in arterial (p less than 0.0001) and venous (p less than 0.003) pressures with simultaneous decreases in urine flow (p less than 0.001) and heart rate (p less than 0.0001) after the intraamniotic injection of arginine vasopressin. We conclude that amniotic arginine vasopressin can be rapidly absorbed in its biologically active form directly into the fetal circulation through the intramembranous pathway. Furthermore, the observation that esophageal ligation did not alter this absorption suggests that the intramembranous pathway may be important in the regulation of amniotic fluid volume and composition.\r"

The direct effect of cocaine on the pregnant, nonhuman primates' uterine vasculature in vivo has not been examined. We investigated the effects of intravenous cocaine on maternal arterial blood pressure, uterine blood flow, and uterine vascular resistance in four unanesthetized, chronically instrumented pregnant baboons. Baboons were instrumented during the latter half of pregnancy, placing an ultrasonic flow probe around one uterine artery and catheters in the maternal inferior vena cava and aorta. Bolus intravenous cocaine hydrochloride doses of 0.05 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, and 0.3 mg/kg by maternal weight were infused 30 minutes apart at least 5 days after surgical instrumentation. The maternal blood pressure rose 7.3% and 12.0% after the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg cocaine infusions, respectively, and the uterine blood flow fell in a dose-dependent fashion 13.1% and 22.7%. Plasma norepinephrine levels rose in response to the 0.3 mg/kg cocaine infusion. These studies show that low doses of cocaine significantly reduce uterine blood flow in the pregnant baboon in a dose-dependent manner by increasing uterine vascular resistance.\r"

To determine whether c-myc expression may also be involved in the growth and development of endometriosis, we assessed c-myc expression in eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissue obtained from women undergoing surgery for endometriosis. Immunocytochemistry using a monoclonal antibody to the c-myc protein demonstrated positive staining of glandular and stromal cell nuclei, and cytoplasmic staining of glandular but not stromal cells in both eutopic and ectopic endometrium. These findings suggest that c-myc expression may be an important regulator of cell proliferation in endometriotic tissue.\r"

  ".U": "91196764\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with a wide range of effects, including induction of B-cell and cytotoxic T-cell differentiation, and induction of acute phase reactant production by hepatocytes. Interleukin-6 also can act as an autocrine growth factor in malignancy. Various cell types produce interleukin-6, including T and B cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, and some solid tumor cells. In previous work we detected the production of substantial amounts of interleukin-6 by human ovarian cancer cells, including the ovarian cancer cell lines CAOV-3, OVCAR-3, and SKOV-3, and several primary ovarian tumor cultures. In this study we retrospectively examined 90 separate serum specimens for interleukin-6 in 36 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. The mean serum interleukin-6 concentration of those ovarian cancer patients with macroscopic disease (n = 57) was 0.26 +/- 0.04 U/ml (mean +/- SEM). Healthy adult donors have interleukin-6 serum levels of 0.12 +/- 0.03 U/ml. Sixteen of 21 ovarian cancer patients with macroscopic disease (76%) had elevated (greater than 0.20 U/ml) levels of serum interleukin-6, with levels approaching 1 U/ml in some patients (p less than 0.01). Of those nine patients with bulky tumor (residual greater than 2 cm), eight (89%) had an elevated interleukin-6 level (mean, 0.31 +/- 0.05), while eight of 12 (66%) with minimal residual disease (less than 2 cm) had elevated levels. Only two of 15 (13%) patients who were in clinical remission and who had microscopic disease had elevated values. Of the 36 patients, 22 were CA 125 negative (less than 35 U/ml), and of these, four had elevated interleukin-6 levels. Of the 14 patients with an elevated CA 125 level, 12 (86%) had elevated interleukin-6 levels. In those 16 patients in whom serial levels of interleukin-6 were measured, rising levels were found over a 3 to 4 month interval in nine (56%); this correlated with tumor progression. Furthermore, the subsequent survival of patients was shown to correlate with the level of interleukin-6, such that patients whose levels were elevated greater than 0.20 U/ml interleukin-6 survived a mean of 12.5 months, compared with 27.2 months for patients with normal levels (p less than 0.001). These data support the concept that interleukin-6 may be a useful tumor marker in some patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, as it correlates with the tumor burden, clinical disease status, and survival.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital malformations often occur sporadically and unpredictably, and a method of population screening to identify at-risk pregnancies would be of great value. Routine ultrasonography has some appeal in this regard. Unfortunately, the literature indicates a relatively poor sensitivity, with usually 30% or less of malformations identified or suspected by this means. Substantially better results have been described with ultrasonography targeted on the basis of screening ultrasonography or clinical findings, but these studies involve highly selected subjects examined carefully by experienced ultrasonographers, and their results are not relevant to population screening. A questionnaire survey of experts in the field indicated disagreement with the separation of screening and targeted ultrasonography, widely varying estimates of the accuracy of either, and average changes of $209 and $263, respectively. Theoretical considerations of the various types of malformations, their frequencies, and the likelihood of ultrasonographic detection reveal a minority of defects in which ultrasonography is both accurate and useful clinically. Ultrasonography seems to be of little potential as a means of screening for congenital malformation because of relatively low sensitivity and uncertain cost effectiveness.\r"

However, in general, the predictive power is modest and no evidence has yet been provided to indicate that these measures can be used as a screening test in the general obstetric population. Continuing research is highly desirable. At the present time, the use of Doppler assessment of blood flow in pregnancy should be limited to the investigational setting.\r"

This approach should attempt to correct every defect present in the pelvic supports. Uterovaginal prolapse is the result rather than the cause of genital prolapse. Not every vaginal hysterectomy should be treated like a cystocele-rectocele repair. Instead, every defect of the endopelvic fascial support should be evaluated in a patient both before and during surgery. As a result of these evaluations, more than just a hysterectomy and an anterior and posterior colporrhaphy may be performed. In a case in which a patient is found to have more than one defect at the time of examination, sacrospinous fixation of the vaginal apex at the time of transvaginal hysterectomy may be indicated. In the office, the patient can be examined in the supine and standing positions, both with and without Valsalva's maneuver, to determine if moderate to severe uterovaginal prolapse exists. Sacrospinous fixation should be performed in those cases as an adjunct to other steps taken to prevent postthysterectomy prolapse.\r"

In this population approximately 75% of the mutations in patients with cystic fibrosis correspond to a 3 base pair deletion that results in the loss of a phenylalanine residue at amino acid position 508 (designated delta F508) from the coding region of the cystic fibrosis gene. Currently, only about half of the couples at risk can be identified as cystic fibrosis carriers. We support conclusions of the National Institutes of Health Workshop on Population Screening for the Cystic Fibrosis Gene, which state that carrier testing should be offered to all individuals or couples with a family history of cystic fibrosis. Good science and solid educational and counseling strategies must be in place before screening for cystic fibrosis is routinely offered to those with a negative family history. Pilot programs that investigate research questions in the delivery of population screening for cystic fibrosis carriers are urgently needed.\r"

The incidence of perinatal mortality and morbidity was similar for the two Doppler patterns. Perinatal survival was highly dependent on the gestational age when hypertension first appeared.

Presentation at less than 30 weeks' gestation was associated with a perinatal survival rate of 38% (p less than 0.005).

  ".W": "The ethical attitudes of health care providers toward abortion, sex selection, and selective termination of normal and anomalous fetuses in singleton or multiple pregnancies were evaluated by questionnaires distributed to members of the American Society of Human Genetics, the International Fetal Medicine and Surgery Society, the Society of Perinatal Obstetricians, ethicists, and clergy. Demographic characteristics of respondents exhibited a preponderance of men (76%), age greater than 40 (68%), and of United States residents (82%). Seventy-nine percent of respondents were in the medical profession. Approximately half of the respondents were Protestant, the rest being evenly distributed among Catholic, Jewish, and other religions. Acceptance of abortion for social indication varied by religion and gestational age but not by religious conviction, age, country, or gender of respondent. First-trimester abortion of a normal singleton pregnancy was considered more acceptable than selective termination of normal fetuses in multifetal gestations. Sex selection was considered unethical by most respondents. Selective termination was deemed ethically appropriate in quadruplets or multifetal gestations of more than five fetuses and in multiple pregnancies bearing one anomalous fetus. In the latter situation, acceptance increased with the severity of fetal anomalies and decreased from the first to the third trimester. The medical specialty of respondents was the only independent factor strongly associated with acceptance of selective termination by trimester, indication, and number of fetuses. Acceptance of selective termination among health care professionals appears to reflect not only perceptions of procedure-related risks and benefits in the index pregnancy but also individual training and religious beliefs.\r"

Several human studies on birth defects have been conducted and the overall results do not implicate coffee as a likely human teratogen. However, there is some evidence that consumption of three or more cups of coffee per day may have a modest effect on lowering infant birth weight. Studies of coffee consumption and increased rates of spontaneous abortion and delayed time to conception are inconsistent and conclusions cannot yet be drawn.\r"

In another experiment, one cervix was completely isolated from prelabor contractility, whereas the contralateral cervix remained intact. Cervical ripening was assessed by measurement of the stretch modulus and rate of creep 2 days later. Treatment with prostaglandin E2 gel and exposure to prelabor contractility resulted in significant unilateral cervical changes, suggesting that at least part of the prostaglandin E2 effect is locally mediated and that spontaneous prelabor contractility may play a role in cervical preparation for labor. Furthermore, because of its simplicity, this animal preparation can be useful in the investigation of the effects of other locally administered substances on cervical ripening.\r"

Blood flow was increased and reduced (by cord occlusion or placental embolization) and ranged 14% to 168% and 8% to 132% from baseline values in the descending aorta and the umbilical artery, respectively. When flow was severely reduced (less than 50% of baseline value), mean placental resistance increased almost fourfold and mean heart rate fell by 30% from baseline levels. There were only weak correlations between Doppler waveform indices and actual flow, which were usually not significantly different from the correlations between Doppler indices and actual heart rate. With both cord occlusion and placental embolization, significant changes of index values from baseline values were seen only when flow was severely reduced. We conclude that Doppler waveform analysis is not sensitive enough to detect acute mild to moderate reductions in placental flow. Increased index values with severely reduced flow may be explained in part by the concomitant fall in heart rate.\r"

In later gestation, light to moderate staining of the cytoplasm of the trophoblast at the true placental site was detected. No appreciable change in staining was noted after day 10. Fetal membranes, identified after day 10, showed intense and unchanging immunostaining for gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Obplacental giant cells showed light to moderate nuclear and cytoplasmic gonadotropin-releasing hormone immunostaining. Light to moderate gonadotropin-releasing hormone immunostaining was also noted in the cytoplasm of uterine epithelium and glands. We conclude that immunoreactive gonadotropin-releasing hormone is present in the cytotrophoblast at the time of the earliest embryo-uterine interactions and may play a significant role in implantation and embryo survival.\r"

To determine whether the intraabdominal sound pressure level was dependent on the static force applied to the electronic artificial larynx, we measured the sound pressure level at a position 20 cm from the surface of the anterior abdominal wall in nonpregnant ewes. The electronic artificial larynx was pressed against the surface with three levels of static force: mild, moderate, and strong. Between mild and strong static forces there was a trend toward a reduction in sound pressure level at the fundamental frequency (85 Hz) and the overtones (170 to 1600 Hz) (p less than 0.08). To further examine the relationship between the static force of sound source against the abdomen and the intraabdominal sound pressure level, sine wave oscillations between 20 Hz and 4.0 kHz were produced with an industrial shaker. With a constant dynamic force (0.16 N) applied to the shaker across frequencies, the sound pressure level was greatest at lower frequencies (100 to 110 dB) and less at higher frequencies, above 1.0 kHz (60 to 80 dB). Consistent with the electronic artificial larynx experiments, strong application of the shaker resulted in greater transmission of sound than did mild application (p less than 0.02).\r"

  ".W": "Renin messenger ribonucleic acid expression has been shown in decidual tissue and endometrium, but weakly in chorion laeve, suggesting decidua as a primary source of uteroplacental renin. We proposed to confirm active renin secretion by endometrial stromal cells and examined the effect of progesterone-induced decidualization on secretion. Separate monolayer cultures of endometrial stroma, trophoblast, and mesenchymal cells were established and maintained for 10 to 15 days. Active renin concentration was measured with radioimmunoassay for angiotensin I generation and expressed as picograms per milliliter of angiotensin I generation per 10(5) cells. Active renin concentration was high in control secretory endometrial stromal cells (513 pg/ml) compared with trophoblast (none) and mesenchymal cell cultures (74 pg/ml). Marked decrease in active renin secretion occurred in control endometrial stromal cells (days 13 to 15, 86 pg/ml), whereas progesterone-induced decidualization sustained and increased secretion (days 13 to 15, 1017 pg/ml). This renin activity was quantitatively inhibited in culture fluid assays by specific human renal renin antibody in serial dilutions. Renin activity measurements before and after trypsin activation showed the majority of renin (91.15%) in the inactive form and a smaller fraction (8.85%) in the active form. Immunohistochemistry with the use of specific human renal renin antibody confirmed the presence of renin and its stimulation by progesterone in endometrial stromal cells. Progesterone had minimal effect on mesenchymal cells. These data confirmed endometrial stromal cells as a significant source of active renin and showed that progesterone induced a marked increase in this production.\r"

In these experiments we utilized an animal model to evaluate the use of an immunomodulatory agent as an alternative treatment for endometriosis-associated subfertility. The right uterine horn of 12 golden hamsters was resected and 2 x 2 mm squares were explanted onto the left uterine mesentery. Controls included hamsters undergoing uterine horn resection without endometrial explantation (n = 6) and nonsurgically treated animals (n = 6). Ovulation induction was initiated 6 weeks postoperatively with 40 IU of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin on day 1 and 40 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin on day 3. Groups of six explant-bearing hamsters and six nonsurgical control hamsters were treated with verapamil (250 micrograms/kg every 8 hours subcutaneously), a calcium channel-blocking agent known to inhibit macrophage activation, from day 1 to 48 hours after administration of human chorionic gonadotropin. Animals were then killed and the number of embryos and oocytes in left tube counted as a reflection of reproductive performance. Fertilization was completely inhibited in animals bearing uterine explants. Treatment with verapamil dramatically reversed this effect. These data suggest that periovulatory treatment with an immunomodulatory agent such as verapamil may be an effective alternative to conventional treatment for endometriosis-associated subfertility.\r"

This study attempts to define the effect of macrophage-derived growth factors on endometrial stromal cell growth in vitro, as well as the interaction between estrogen and these growth factors. Mouse endometrial stromal cells were prepared and cultured in either a serum-containing, insulin-free medium or a serum-free, insulin-containing medium, and the effects of adding 10% macrophage-conditioned medium on [3H]thymidine incorporation were assessed. Results indicate that macrophage-conditioned medium will increase incorporation in the presence of insulin but not in insulin-free media. Serum can substitute for macrophage-conditioned medium, but the two together show no additive or synergistic effect. The effect of estrogen on this system was determined, and results indicate that estrogen will perform the function of insulin, with an optimal concentration of 10(-10) to 10(-12) mol/L. Thus macrophage-conditioned medium appears to function as a competence growth factor, and estrogen (in appropriate concentrations) functions as a progression growth factor.\r"

Synaptic plasticity also occurs within the arcuate nucleus after physiologic surges of estrogen. Although the function of estrogen-induced peroxidase is unclear at present, in other systems peroxidase can generate free radicals by catalyzing the oxidation of some molecules, including estrogen. Because free radicals underlie remodeling in a number of tissues, estrogen-induced free radicals could mediate synaptic remodeling within the arcuate nucleus. Although they contain estrogen-inducible peroxidase, astrocytes do not contain estrogen receptors as measured by conventional techniques, suggesting that estrogen-inducible peroxidase arises from some novel mechanism. Estrogen could induce peroxidase within receptor-deficient astrocytes by binding to receptors in neurons and stimulating the release of some factor that interacts with astrocytes. Alternatively, estrogen could act directly on astrocytes in the absence of estrogen receptors. Although astrocytes in the hypothalamus of the rat do not contain classical nuclear estrogen receptors, they do bind fluorescein-conjugated estradiol in extranuclear sites. The distribution of fluorescein-conjugated estradiol binding within the hypothalamus overlaps that of peroxidase-rich astrocytes, and double labeling reveals many cells with the stellate morphology of astrocytes, containing both peroxidase and fluorescein-conjugated estradiol binding. However, because peroxidase and fluorescein-conjugated estradiol always occupy different compartments of the cell, the fluorescein-conjugated estradiol is not binding to peroxidase.\r"

The technique of dual in vitro perfusion of an isolated cotyledon has provided important data for the human placenta. The high degree of permeability for hydrophilic molecules was recently confirmed by in vivo measurements that allow estimates of flux across the human placenta for a number of compounds. The bidirectional nature in transplacental exchange requires asymmetry in flux from the maternal to the fetal side or vice versa, which can be assured by a concentration gradient or an active transport system. There is increasing evidence that placental metabolism with active modification of the composition of nutrients released to the fetus in addition to transport plays an important role.\r"

Pulmonary injury was more likely to occur in the more severe cases; however, the presence of a maternal heart rate greater than 110 beats/min and a fever to 103 degrees F 12 to 24 hours before the occurrence of respiratory symptoms in a gestation greater than 20 weeks was highly predictive of pulmonary injury. The most significant predictive factors associated with pulmonary injury were elements of treatment such as fluid overload, use of tocolytic agents, and, to a lesser extent, choice of antibiotic. Therefore, if tocolytic agents are considered at all in the management of acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy, they should be used only in patients with documented cervical change. In addition, urinary output should be monitored very closely. These data also may suggest a cause of the pulmonary edema that is occasionally seen in the management of premature labor with the use of tocolytic agents and fluids in the presence of a possible occult infection.\r"

Forty patients with intact membranes in preterm labor at 23 to 34 weeks' gestation were randomized to receive either intravenous ritodrine or oral indomethacin as the first-line tocolytic agent. Successful intravenous ritodrine therapy was followed by oral terbutaline therapy, and indomethacin-treated patients continued to receive oral indomethacin. Treatment failures were defined as progressive preterm labor or patient intolerance, and these patients were treated with intravenous magnesium sulfate. Ritodrine and indomethacin were equally successful in delaying preterm birth as defined by interval to delivery, gestational age at delivery, delivery delayed greater than 7 days, attainment of 35 weeks of gestation, percentage of patients who required magnesium sulfate therapy, percentage of patients who were readmitted with premature rupture of membranes, absence of recurrent preterm labor, and infant birth weight. More than 80% of mothers who received ritodrine voiced complaints of beta-sympathomimetic side effects, and one patient discontinued treatment as the result of intolerance. There were minimal patient complaints with indomethacin use. No statistically significant differences were noted in neonatal outcome as defined by Apgar scores, umbilical cord pH, intensive care days, ventilator days, or neonatal deaths. However, three cases of primary pulmonary hypertension were observed in the indomethacin group. We had not previously observed this problem with short-term (24 to 48 hours) indomethacin therapy.\r"

  ".U": "91196795\r", 
  ".W": "Women with luteal phase deficiency have been shown to have an increased frequency of luteinizing hormone pulses in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Because progesterone is known to modulate luteinizing hormone secretion, it has been hypothesized that the decreased progesterone secretion in a previous luteal phase deficiency cycle could lead to the abnormal luteinizing hormone secretory pattern in the ensuing early follicular phase. With the possibility that the higher luteinizing hormone pulse frequency might lead to another deficient luteal phase, it becomes conceivable that luteal phase deficiency could be self-perpetuating. To test this hypothesis, luteal phase deficiency was induced in six normal women by decreasing luteinizing hormone support of the corpus luteum with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist Nal-Glu, administered twice daily beginning in the midluteal phase after a control cycle. During the antagonist-treated luteal phase, each subject met the predetermined criteria for induced luteal phase deficiency: a 33% or greater decrease in integrated progesterone from the control cycle and an integrated progesterone level less than 100 ng/ml per day. Luteinizing hormone secretion patterns were determined by frequent blood sampling performed every 10 minutes for 12 hours in the early follicular phase of the control cycle and the cycle after antagonist administration. Daily luteal progesterone levels were measured in the control, treatment, and posttreatment cycles. Each volunteer served as her own control. Standard parameters were compared between the control and posttreatment pulse studies in the early follicular phase: (1) luteinizing hormone pulse frequency was 9.5 +/- 1.0 vs 10.0 +/- 0.9 pulses/12 hours, control vs posttreatment, respectively, p = 0.5; (2) luteinizing hormone pulse amplitude was 11.0 +/- 1.3 vs 12.0 +/- 2.2 ng/ml, p = 0.6; and (3) luteinizing hormone mean level was 19.4 +/- 2.3 vs 22.2 +/- 3.3 ng/ml, p = 0.1. Corpus luteum function was also compared between the control and posttreatment cycles. Luteal phase length was 13.7 +/- 0.6 vs 12.7 +/- 0.6 days, p = 0.08. Integrated progesterone values were 136.9 +/- 12.9 vs 130.5 +/- 11.3 ng/ml per day, p = 0.5. Therefore no discernible abnormalities in early follicular luteinizing hormone secretions or corpus luteum secretion of progesterone occurred after an induced luteal phase deficiency cycle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of 588 patients with vulvar carcinoma delineated four risk groups by the proportional hazards model. Groin node status (laterality and number positive) and lesion diameter were the only two important independent prognostic factors. The 5-year relative survival rates were 98%, 87%, 75%, and 29% for the risk group categories of minimal (negative groin nodes and lesion diameter less than or equal to 2 cm), low (one positive groin node and lesion diameter less than or equal to 2 cm or negative groin nodes and fewer than two lesions less than or equal to 8 cm diameter), intermediate (negative groin nodes and lesion diameter greater than 8 cm diameter, one positive groin node and lesion diameter greater than 2 cm, or two unilaterally positive groin nodes and lesion diameter less than or equal to 8 cm), and high (three or more positive groin nodes or two bilaterally positive groin nodes), respectively. Applying the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging (1988) to these data discriminated risk of death (caused by recurrent vulvar cancer); the 5-year rates were 98%, 85%, 74%, and 31% for stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively. However, within International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III there were 47 low-, 95 intermediate-, and 28 high-risk patients with relative survivals of 95%, 74%, and 34%, respectively. Overall, this assessment validates current International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics vulvar carcinoma staging, but further refinements are warranted in stage III.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND: Cuba's response to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic has been to conduct mass testing of the population to ascertain seroprevalence, to enforce mandatory relative quarantine of persons testing positive, and to implement educational interventions using media and school-based programs. METHODS: Interview with the Vice-Minister of Health and review of available data. RESULTS: Reports to date show a very low seroprevalence rate without evidence of a widespread epidemic. Sexual contact with foreign-born persons is the primary risk factor. Possible advantages of Cuba's policy include rapid reduction in the risk of HIV transmission by infected blood products, an opportunity for focused education and secondary prevention, and limitation of new infections. Possible disadvantages include the restriction of individual freedom in those who are not guilty of any illegal act, quarantine of persons with false positive HIV tests, and ongoing transmission because of the incomplete nature of the quarantine. The policy is expensive and may displace other public health priorities. The content of the media-based educational interventions has emphasized rational medical information in unimaginative formats with a limited focus on prevention. CONCLUSIONS: The issue of personal responsibility for behavioral change versus government imposed regulations is at the core of Cuba's HIV policy. The quarantine policy may paradoxically permit most Cubans to feel that they are personally invulnerable to the HIV epidemic.\r"

METHODS: The educational intervention was conducted by a health educator in a one-on-one format and provided information about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and strategies for reducing the risk of infection. Risk was assessed prior to the intervention and was compared to a follow-up assessment obtained approximately three months later (n = 322). RESULTS: The percentage who reported using drugs intravenously decreased from 92.2 to 70.5, and the percentage who reported sharing syringes dropped from 67.4 to 24.3. Reductions of these and other high-risk behaviors were detected across various demographic subgroups, and analyses show that the impact of the intervention endured for several months. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that intravenous drug users conform to a model of rational choice when confronted with accurate information about the devastating consequences of HIV infection.\r"

METHODS: In an adult cohort enrolled to investigate causes of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, we identified current behaviors affecting risk of infection that were associated with a history of early sexual abuse. One hundred and eighty-six individuals provided information on the occurrence of abuse and subsequent sexual and drug using activities. RESULTS: Approximately half of the women and one-fifth of the men reported a history of rape during childhood or adulthood. Twenty-eight percent of the women and 15 percent of the men recalled that they had been sexually assaulted during childhood. People who reported childhood rape compared with people who did not were four times more likely to be working as prostitutes (90 percent confidence interval = 2.0, 8.0). Women were nearly three times more likely to become pregnant before the age of 18 (90% CI = 1.6, 4.1). Men who reported a history of sexual abuse had a twofold increase in prevalence of HIV infection relative to unabused men (90% CI = 1.0, 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: The disturbing prevalence of early sexual abuse and its possible health-related consequences call for prompt and routine investigation of sexual abuse histories. Identification of sexual victimization may be an important component for management of risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND: In November 1986, a Detroit, Michigan city ordinance requiring mandatory jail sentences for illegally carrying a firearm in public was passed to preserve \"the public peace, health, safety, and welfare of the people.\" METHODS: We conducted a set of interrupted time-series analyses to evaluate the impact of the law on the incidence of homicides, hypothesizing that the ordinance, by its nature, would affect only firearm homicides and homicides committed outside (e.g., on the street). RESULTS: The incidence of homicide in general increased after the law was passed, but the increases in non-firearm homicides and homicides committed inside (e.g., in a home) were either statistically significant or approached statistical significance (p = .006 and p = .070, respectively), whereas changes in the incidence of firearm homicides and homicides committed outside were not statistically significant (p = .238 and p = .418, respectively). We also determined that the ordinance was essentially unenforced, apparently because of a critical shortage of jail space. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with a model in which the ordinance had a dampening effect on firearm homicides occurring in public in Detroit. The apparent preventive effect evident in the time series analyses may have been due to publicity about the ordinance, whereas the small nature of the effect may have been due to the lack of enforcement.\r"

METHODS: We studied 1,603 randomly selected Hispanic, Native American, and non-Hispanic White women in New Mexico to determine the prevalence of cervical HPV infection in these ethnic groups, and its association with Pap smear abnormalities, using a new commercial dot-blot hybridization assay. RESULTS: Nine percent of all women screened had evidence of cervical HPV infection (13.7% of non-Hispanic White women, 9.7% of Hispanics, and 6.6% of Native American women). Prevalence was higher in younger women ages 14-19 years than in older age groups. Over half of women with cervical HPV infection (n = 145) had normal Pap smears. The proportion of infected women increased among those with more advanced cytopathologic abnormalities; 5.6 percent with normal Pap smears had cervical HPV vs 66.7 percent with moderate-severe dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical HPV infection is common among New Mexico clinic attendees, varies in prevalence among the three major ethnic groups, and is strongly associated with cervical cytopathologic abnormalities.\r"

METHODS: In three well-defined occupational populations in eastern Tennessee, we assessed the prevalence, incidence, and cumulative incidence of stones and measured biochemical risk factors for lithogenesis. RESULTS: The age-adjusted prevalence of stones was 18.5 percent in Tennessee compared to 7.7 percent among White males in US NHANES (prevalence ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.7, 3.3). The cumulative incidence (risk) was 27.8 percent by age 65, higher than in any other reported population. Risk factors were age, a family history, and urinary saturation with calcium-oxalate (COAX). Persons with a positive family history and the highest measured CAOX index had a predicted lifetime risk of 88.8 percent. Biochemical factors affecting lithogenesis were hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, and low urine volume. CONCLUSION: Future research should characterize the geographic boundaries of a southeastern \"stone-belt\" and explore genetic and dietary hypotheses that might explain it.\r"

Recent evidence, however, suggests that their use may be decreasing. METHODS: We examine the population prevalence and correlates of use of benzodiazepine anxiolytics at the Duke site of the NIMH-sponsored Epidemiologic Catchment Area project. RESULTS: Bivariate analysis of use patterns for the drugs revealed demographic predictors similar to those reported in previous studies: increased likelihood of use by the elderly, Whites, women, the less educated, and the separated or divorced. Use is also associated with symptoms of psychic distress, negative life events, use of health care services, and diagnoses of affective disorder, agoraphobia with panic, and panic disorder. Age, sex, race, education, and marital status remain associated with non-hypnotic benzodiazepine use in a logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate analyses of these data indicate that when potential confounding factors are controlled, age, sex, race, education, and marital status are significantly related to benzodiazepine anxiolytic use but the effects of sex and education are mediated by intervening variables. Implications of these findings are discussed particularly in relation to high levels of use in the elderly.\r"

RESULTS: The age-adjusted death rate from all injuries for China exceeds the rate for the US (69.0 vs 61.3 per 100,000). The US has higher death rates from motor vehicle crashes, fires, and homicide; China has greater mortality from drowning, poisoning, falls, and suicide. Especially noteworthy in China are the high drowning rates among young children and the elderly and the high suicide rates in rural areas among young adults and the elderly. CONCLUSION: Injury is an important public health problem in China, exceeding in many respects the problem in the United States. It is urgent for China to place high priority on injury research and prevention.\r"

METHODS: Thirty-four health workers were taught and tested on the RTH during a first week of training and on the GS during a second week (the RTH-GS group), while the order was reversed for another 25 trainees (the GS-RTH group). The health workers were trained and tested on their ability not only to use and interpret the two charts, but also to make the right decisions about specific actions to be taken when growth faltering occurs. RESULTS: There was no difference between scores to the RTH and GS charts after one week of training. After the second week of training, the scores to the RTH chart improved and became better than those to the GS chart. The scores to the GS test did not increase with previous knowledge of the RTH chart. CONCLUSIONS: For this reason and others discussed in the paper, the RTH chart was recommended for nationwide use in Lesotho. The adoption of this recommendation was facilitated by the close involvement in this research of public and private agencies responsible for growth monitoring in Lesotho.\r"

  ".W": "In 1988, the Los Angeles County Health Department conducted a blinded human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence study at a public prenatal (PN) and family planning (FP) center serving mostly Hispanic women in order to determine seroprevalence and to evaluate the center's targeted HIV screening program. Four women (0.13 percent) tested positive (3/1801 PN and 1/1167 FP). Three reported no risk factors; one reported a history of syphilis since 1978. Voluntary HIV testing was selectively offered to women who reported risk factors for HIV infection. Only 14 percent (96/685) of clients offered testing chose to do it: 28 percent (14/50) of clients classified as being at highest risk of infection, and 27 percent (16/59) of women who judged themselves to have some chance of being exposed to HIV. None of the four women who tested positive by blinded testing chose testing. While few women at this center were infected with HIV, higher risk women were not persuaded to be tested through a targeted screening program. Blinded HIV seroprevalence studies provide a tool for both tracking infection in a population and evaluating screening programs.\r"

Approximately 17 percent had either donated or sold blood during 1985 through 1988; most contributors (80.4 percent) sold to commercial blood services. IVDUs who had donated/sold blood were more likely to be male and not in drug treatment than were those who had not contributed blood. IVDUs not in treatment at the time of interview were more likely than IVDUs in treatment to have sold blood. Of those who had donated/sold blood since 1985, 19.6 percent subsequently tested positive for antibodies to HIV-1 and 5.7 percent were positive for antibodies to HTLV-I/II. Increased effort is required to screen prospective donors and sellers, particularly at commercial blood banks.\r"

Six populations were selected as windows on the epidemic: newborns, homeless adolescents, prisoners, and clients of family planning, STD, and drug treatment clinics. Testing of all newborns in New York State began in December 1987, and all six study windows were operational by June 1988. As of March 1990 blind testing for HIV antibody had been performed on more than 725,000 blood specimens in these six studies.

Sixty-four zip codes with two or more seropositives and an HIV seroprevalence rate twice the average outside of New York City contained 65 percent of the HIV seropositives but only 16 percent of the newborns tested. Newborn seropositivity increased with maternal age. In New York City, the seroprevalence rates increased from 0.16 percent (1 in 624) for 14-year-olds to 1.41 percent (1 in 71) for 24-year-olds, a ninefold rise.

Of the expected total HIV specimens 1.5 percent were never received by the Newborn Screening Program, 0.5 percent were invalid specimens for which no repeat specimen could be obtained, and 1.7 percent were unsuitable or of insufficient quantity to be tested for HIV antibody. Thus 96.3 percent of all 1988 New York newborns were tested for HIV antibody. Black infants from New York City and low-birthweight infants were represented disproportionately among those not tested.

Less significant correlations were found for New York State exclusive of New York City. For New York City a model comprising low birthweight and all drug discharges was shown by multiple regression analysis to be most strongly associated with HIV status (r2 = .77). Elsewhere a model comprising race/ethnicity (percent Black, percent Hispanic) and cocaine drug discharges had the best, but less strong association (r2 = .39). However, because of intercorrelations, race/ethnicity added little when the other variables were included first. Knowledge of the geographic association between HIV seroprevalence and sociodemographic status can be useful in designing and focusing prevention efforts in areas at highest risk for future HIV/AIDS activity.\r"

The number of infants who were born in these same months and hospitalized with an ARD within 12 months of birth was obtained from a data base containing information on all hospital discharges in New York State. Comparisons were made on the basis of month of birth. Of infants born during the study period, 995 tested positive for HIV antibody, and 151 infants (15 percent) were hospitalized with an ARD within 12 months of birth. The 151 ARD cases had a total of 240 hospitalizations, accounting for 5,772 patient days. Fifty-six percent of the ARD cases were diagnosed within six months of birth.\r"

  ".W": "In October 1987, the New York State Department of Health initiated a study to determine the prevalence of antibody to HIV in clients of a facility for runaway and homeless adolescents in New York City. A risk-assessment component was added in May 1988. As of December 1989, a total of 2,667 adolescents had been tested, and 142 (5.3 percent) were found to be HIV-seropositive (males 6.0 percent, females 4.2 percent). The seroprevalence rate increased from 1.3 percent for 15-year-olds to 8.6 percent for 20-year-olds. Hispanics had the highest seroprevalence rate (6.8 percent), followed by non-Hispanic Whites (6.0 percent) and non-Hispanic Blacks (4.6 percent). HIV seropositivity was associated with intravenous drug use, male homosexual/bisexual activity, prostitution, and history of another sexually transmitted disease. The alarmingly high prevalence of HIV infection in this selected population illustrates the immediate need for prevention programs for adolescents.\r"

New York City has reported 22,231 (84 percent) of the statewide cases. The epidemiology of AIDS in New York State has been easily influenced by the large number of cases among IVDUs. Whereas intravenous drug use accounts for 16 percent of adult/adolescent cases in the rest of the nation, it accounts for 39 percent of the cases in New York State. Intravenous drug use is the leading exposure category among racial minorities, with a disproportionately high rate of cases among Blacks and Hispanics. The epidemic among women and children has also been severe, resulting from intravenous drug use by women, heterosexual transmission from drug users to women, and perinatal transmission to their children.\r"

By demonstrating the severity of HIV infections within communities, New York State surveys have spurred preventive interventions, including information to the public and health care providers and increased counseling and testing of women of reproductive age. In high-prevalence areas the community health workers have been employed in preventive activities. Specific information has been provided to county health departments on zip code areas with high HIV seroprevalence rates. Serosurveys revealed that the magnitude of HIV infection in adolescents is much larger than indicated by case reports. Various seroprevalence studies confirmed higher rates of infection with increasing age and minority status and a strong association with intravenous drug use. Combining data provided by seroprevalence studies in a given community enables planners to assess the extent of infection in that community and in groups important to transmission of the virus.\r"

A study was undertaken to assess the cardiovascular changes and to evaluate suitable monitoring techniques to detect critical events during sedation and endoscopy. Twenty patients scheduled to undergo a prolonged endoscopic procedure which required deep sedation were studied. Continuous recordings of electrocardiogram, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were made and arterial pressure was recorded at one-minute intervals. The study commenced immediately before administration of sedatives, continued for the duration of the examination and for one hour following the examination. Oxygen saturation decreased in all patients during the examination to a mean of 82.9% (SD 11.9), and remained below baseline for the duration of the examination and into the recovery period. Statistically significant increases and reductions of systolic arterial pressure and rate-pressure product were found during the procedures compared with baseline values recorded before administration of sedatives. Sixteen of the 20 patients developed tachycardia during the examination. Ten patients developed ectopic foci which were supraventricular, ventricular or both in origin. Electrocardiogram changes resolved during the recovery period. Myocardial ischaemia was assessed by S-T segment depression and a significant correlation was found between S-T segment depression and hypoxaemia, although the magnitude of the S-T depression was small and may not have been detected clinically. No correlation was found between S-T segment depression and arterial pressure, heart rate or rate-pressure product.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Posthypoxic myoclonus is a rare complication of successful cardiopulmonary resusitation. Recognition depends on the awareness that the syndrome exists, and is important so that correct therapy can be instituted. There may be important prognostic implications. Both our patients had normal intellectual recovery with moderate residual neurological disability from their movement disorder.\r"

Regardless of whether fractional or functional saturation is used by manufacturers to calibrate their oximeters, evaluation against fractional saturation is recommended since this is the clinically relevant variable. The use of standard notation and comparisons based on bias and precision is recommended. The accuracy of pulse oximetry is intrinsically limited by the use of only two wavelengths, and is dependent on the initial calibration population. The empirical algorithms used to convert the signal to its 'readout value' and the quality control of hardware may both be important sources of variability between oximeters. Change in blood temperature may introduce errors in pulse oximeter and in vitro oximeter saturation readings, but these will be clinically insignificant. Changes in blood pH should not decrease pulse oximetry accuracy.\r"

Most pulse oximeters have an absolute mean error of less than 2% at normal saturation and perfusion; two-thirds have a standard deviation (SD) of less than 2%, and the remainder an SD of less than 3%. Some pulse oximeters tend to read 100% with fractional saturations of 97-98%. Pulse oximeters may be suitable hyperoxic alarms for neonates if the alarm limit chosen is directly validated for each device. Pulse oximeters are poorly calibrated at low saturations and are generally less accurate and less precise than at normal saturations; nearly 30% of 244 values reviewed were in error by more than 5% at saturations of less than 80%. Ear, nose and forehead probes respond more rapidly to rapid desaturation than finger probes, but are generally less accurate and less precise. Ear oximetry may be inaccurate during exercise. Low signal quality can result in failure to present a saturation reading, but data given with low signal quality warning messages are generally no less accurate than those without. Cardiac arrhythmias do not decrease accuracy of pulse oximeters so long as saturation readings are steady.\r"

Angiotensin II increases myocardial oxygen consumption whilst reducing coronary flow and is also directly toxic to the myocardium. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors produce beneficial haemodynamic and neuroendocrine changes in patients with acute left ventricular failure, and may have a role in selected patients with cardiogenic shock. There is evidence to suggest that they might prevent the development of late cardiac failure by limiting the extent of post infarction ventricular dilation. Further research is necessary to define their role in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Recurrent stenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is a significant problem, requiring repeat dilation in about one-third of all treated patients. Various clinical and procedure-related predictors have been proposed. Between 1983 and 1987, 257 patients underwent 322 procedures, where 380 stenoses were attempted. Indications were: stable angina pectoris 73%, unstable angina pectoris 22%, other indication 5%. The primary success rate was defined as a less than 50% remaining postprocedure stenosis. FINDINGS: Repeat angiograms were done for 88% of the initially successful cases, either six months after PTCA or if there was a clinical recurrence. Restenosis was defined as a recurrence of a more than 50% diameter stenosis. The restenosis rate was 33% and was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) for unstable (46%) than for stable angina pectoris (29%). There was a nonsignificant tendency to a higher restenosis rate in the left anterior descending artery than in the other coronary vessels. IMPLICATIONS: The increased restenosis rate seen after PTCA for unstable angina pectoris could be caused by a higher activity in systems affecting the proliferative processes in the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall, which is thought to form the pathophysiologic basis for restenosis after PTCA.\r"

  ".W": "Reduced oxygen tension is regarded as the primary physiologic signal for the production of erythropoietin (EPO). There is little information available about early changes of EPO production in man due to severe hypoxia. The purpose of the present study was to examine the time course of EPO in serum of patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE). In 29 patients (seventy-five +/- six years, mean age +/- SEM) who were hospitalized within two hours after onset of symptoms of ACPE, serum EPO concentrations were monitored for up to seventy-two hours. At the moment of admission all patients showed significantly increased EPO concentrations of 121 +/- 64 mU/mL (mean +/- SEM) compared with a healthy population (15-35 mU/mL). Twenty-three patients who recovered within thirty minutes (group A) exhibited a quick return of their EPO serum levels to normal. The remaining 6 patients (group B) had a protracted clinical course and their EPO concentration showed a further increase up to the end of the observation period. The comparative monitoring of concentrations of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, antithrombin III, C-reactive protein, fibronectin, hapotoglobin, and transerrin in serum and plasma revealed no significant changes. Thus a major contribution of fluid shifts into or from the intravascular compartment to the observed changes in EPO concentration seems to be unlikely. The data suggest that the production and release of EPO in the kidneys due to altered oxygen delivery is a fast-responding mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five type-1 diabetic uremic patients (14 men, 11 women, mean age forty +/- eleven years, range, nineteen to sixty) were prospectively analyzed for coronary artery disease (CAD) by thallium scan (TLS) before synchronus pancreas and kidney transplantation. Duration of diabetes ranged from ten to thirty-two years (mean twenty-two +/- five). Fifteen patients (60%) were in dialysis from two to sixty months (mean twenty +/- eighteen). Advanced diabetic degenerative complications were present in all patients. Twenty exercise and five pharmacologic thallium scans were performed. Forty-four percent of patients (6 men, 5 women, mean age forty-two +/- eleven years, range, twenty-six to sixty) had a positive (reversible or permanent defects) TLS. In 2/11 cases, severe CAD required further cardiac investigations for therapeutic management decision. A statistical correlation with resting ECG nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities was observed (p less than 0.05) despite the absence of angor in 8 of the 11 patients. On the contrary, no statistical correlations were found regarding high blood pressure, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, duration of diabetes, and duration of dialysis. In this particular diabetic population (young age, male/female ratio = 1.2) with high incidence of silent ischemia, resting ECG repolarization abnormalities, though predictive, were not specific or prognostic of CAD severity; in these cases, exercise and pharmacologic TLS, a noninvasive and sensitive cardiovascular test, may be of great interest in diagnosis of CAD, allowing adequate cardiac management before, during, and after pancreas transplantation.\r"

Predominant findings were stenotic or occlusive changes, but fusiform or saccular aneurysms were also found in 36 patients (31.9%) in the various sites of aorta and its major branches. Multiple aneurysms were found in 15 patients. The most common site of aneurysms was the ascending aorta (16 patients); in 7 of the patients these were complicated by aortic regurgitation. Aneurysms developed in the aortic arch in 3 patients, in the descending aorta in 11, in the abdominal aorta in 7, and in the major branches of the aortic arch in 9 patients. In 2 patients, follow-up angiograms showed enlargement of the aneurysms, and rupture of the aneurysm occurred in 1 patient. Aneurysms were found even in young patients. A fifteen-year-old female showed a huge aneurysm in the ascending aorta as the initial manifestation of this disease. Thickening of the walls of aneurysms was common and characteristic. This study revealed the moderately high incidence of aneurysms of various sites of arteries in patients with Takayasu's arteritis. The authors conclude that aneurysm, as well as occlusive changes, can be a primary lesion.\r"

Compliance was poor, but similar, in both trials. Patients took the study drug as instructed on a mean of 37.3% days (range 10% to 77%) in one trial and 37.4% days (range 0% to 63%) in the other. Both underuse and overuse were observed. Underuse was seen on a mean of 38.9% days (range 9% to 81%) and 46.0% (range 15% to 80%) respectively; overuse on a mean of 23.5% days (range 6% to 54%) and 16.6% days (range 0% to 41%). In some patients ten or more activations of the device were recorded at the same time. In six patients such multiple simultaneous activations were recorded on two or more separate days. These patients were among the most noncompliant in the study. Multiple simultaneous activations frequently followed underuse days or preceded followup visits, suggesting the possibility of duplicity. Overall compliance was such that valid conclusions about efficacy of the drugs could only have been drawn in six of 34 patients.\r"

Mild to moderate anxiety levels may prove advantageous in the management of asthmatics but when their anxiety level becomes maladaptive, as in the case of panic attacks, their medical care is placed in jeopardy. Herein are three case reports of asthmatics who also exhibited panic disorders and their clinical outcome. It is concluded that a team approach, involving the primary physician and psychologist or psychiatrist, is beneficial in the long-term management of these patients.\r"

Eighteen patients received Volmax, 8 mg bid, and 20 patients received Proventil Repetabs, 8 mg (as two 4-mg tablets) bid. The magnitude and duration of bronchodilation were determined after the first dose and at steady state on treatment day 7 by measuring serial values of pulmonary function for 12 hours on each day. Interpatient variability in bronchodilation was calculated for each study day did not differ significantly between treatments, the interpatient variability in bronchodilation with Volmax was, on average, one-half of that experienced with Proventil Repetabs. Adverse events, mainly headache and tremor, were comparable between Volmax and Proventil Repetabs. This study demonstrates that Volmax achieves less variable bronchodilation through a more constant rate of drug delivery from the onset of therapy.\r"

Nasal stuffiness, nasal discharge, sneezing, nasal itching and the nasal index (the sum of the mean scores of the first three symptoms) averaged over the first 6 weeks and second 6 weeks of the study were significantly reduced in patients who received the 220 micrograms/day and the 440 micrograms/day dosages.

During the last 6 weeks of the study, patients were allowed to take oral back-up medication for their nasal symptoms; all three groups receiving triamcinolone nasal aerosol took less back-up medication than did the placebo group. There were no significant adverse effects or laboratory abnormalities noted during this study.

Interactions with this type of patient may leave the physician with feelings of guilt, frustration, and helplessness. We review such an encounter with the purpose of describing how to deal with this type of patient and to guide the physician in responding to this adverse behavior. Such patients will usually require limits to be set on behavioral acting out for their own best interest. Further, it is often necessary to make continued care contingent on compliance with the ground rules set. The physician must be aware of his or her adverse feelings toward the patient and be able to interpret the behavior in the context of the psychiatric disorder so that appropriate psychologic help for the patient can be provided.\r"

DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, trial. PATIENTS: The study included 333 men with baseline chronic stable angina but with no previous history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attack who were enrolled in the Physicians' Health Study, a trial of aspirin among 22,071 male physicians. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive alternate-day aspirin therapy (325 mg) or placebo and were followed for an average of 60.2 months for the occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. RESULTS: During follow-up, 27 patients had confirmed myocardial infarctions; 7 were among the 178 patients with chronic stable angina who received aspirin therapy and 20 were among the 155 patients who received placebo (relative risk, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.63; P = 0.003). While simultaneously controlling for other cardiovascular risk factors in a proportional hazards model, an overall 87% risk reduction was calculated (relative risk, 0.13; CI, 0.04 to 0.42; P less than 0.001). For the subgroup of patients with chronic stable angina but no previous coronary bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty, an almost identical reduction in the risk for myocardial infarction was found (relative risk, 0.14; CI, 0.04 to 0.56; P = 0.006). Of 13 strokes, 11 occurred in the aspirin group and 2 in the placebo group (relative risk, 5.4; CI, 1.3 to 22.1; P = 0.02). No stroke was fatal, but 4 produced some long-term impairment of function. One stroke, in the aspirin group, was hemorrhagic. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that alternate-day aspirin therapy greatly reduced the risk for first myocardial infarction among patients with chronic stable angina, a group of patients at high risk for cardiovascular death (P less than 0.001). Although our results for stroke were based on small numbers, they suggested an apparent increase in frequency of stroke with aspirin therapy; this finding requires confirmation in randomized trials of adequate sample size.\r"

SETTING: Smoking cessation clinic and community. PATIENTS: Convenience sample of 132 adult smokers and non-smokers in 1988. MEASUREMENTS: A questionnaire was administered to quantify cigarette smoking and to obtain information about possibly confounding factors such as skin pigmentation, sun exposure, age, and sex. Wrinkling was assessed using photographs of the temple region, and a severity score based on predetermined criteria was assigned. A logistic regression model, which controlled for confounding variables, was developed to assess the risk for premature wrinkling in response to pack-years of smoking. MAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of premature wrinkling was independently associated with sun exposure and pack-years of smoking. After controlling for age, sex, and sun exposure, premature wrinkling increased with increased pack-years of smoking. Heavy cigarette smokers (greater than 50 pack-years) were 4.7 times more likely to be wrinkled than nonsmokers (95% CI, 1.0 to 22.6; P value for trend = 0.05). Sun exposure of more than 50,000 lifetime hours also increased the risk of being excessively wrinkled 3.1-fold (CI, 1.2 to 7.1). When excessive sun exposure and cigarette smoking occurred together, the risk for developing excessive wrinkling was multiplicative (prevalence ratio of 12.0; CI, 1.5 to 530). CONCLUSION: Cigarette smoking is an independent risk factor for the development of premature wrinkling.\r"

DESIGN: A randomized trial of two catheter materials, with consideration of 21 potential risk factors. SETTING: A university hospital. PATIENTS: Hospitalized adults without granulocytopenia who received a peripheral intravenous catheter. INTERVENTIONS: House officers or ward nurses inserted the catheters, and each insertion was randomized to a catheter made of tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene (FEP-Teflon) or a novel polyetherurethane without leachable additives (PEU-Vialon). MEASUREMENTS: Research nurses scored insertion sites each day for inflammation and cultured catheters at removal. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier risk for phlebitis exceeded 50% by day 4 after catheterization. intravenous antibiotics (relative risk, 2.00), female sex (relative risk, 1.88), prolonged (greater than 48 hours) catheterization (relative risk, 1.79), and catheter material (PEU-Vialon: FEP-Teflon) (relative risk, 0.73) strongly predicted phlebitis in a Cox proportional hazards model (each, P less than 0.003). The best-fit model for severe phlebitis identified the same predictors plus catheter-related infection (relative risk, 6.19), phlebitis with a previous catheter (relative risk, 1.54), and anatomic site (hand: forearm, relative risk, 0.71; wrist:forearm, relative risk, 0.60). The low incidence of local catheter-related infection was comparable with the two catheter materials (5.4% [95% CI, 3.8% to 7.6%] and 6.9% [CI, 4.9% to 9.6%]); none of the 1054 catheters prospectively studied caused bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors, including the infusate and the duration of cannulation, contribute to the development of infusion-related phlebitis. The use of peripheral intravenous catheters made of PEU-Vialon appears to pose the same risk for catheter-related infection as the use of catheters made of FEP-Teflon, and PEU-Vialon can permit longer cannulation with less risk for phlebitis. The risk for catheter-related bacteremia with FEP-Teflon and PEU-Vialon catheters is sufficiently low that it no longer seems justifiable to recommend the use of small steel needles for most peripheral intravenous therapy.\r"

DESIGN: Cohort study of 80 patients with uniformly treated low-grade lymphoma, followed for a median of 21 months. These 80 patients, all of whom had serum beta-2M drawn within 2 weeks before starting therapy, were derived from a cohort of 119 previously untreated patients entered into one of three clinical trials. SETTING: Tertiary referral cancer center. PATIENTS: Eighty previously untreated stage I to IV patients (mean age, 55 years). INTERVENTION: Treatment was given according to Ann Arbor stage: Patients in stage IV were treated with CHOP-bleomycin and maintained on interferon therapy; those in stage III received CHOP-bleomycin and radiotherapy; and those in stages I and II received COP-bleomycin and radiotherapy. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome was determined by assessing complete remission rate and time to treatment failure. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used. RESULTS: The complete remission rate for patients with a beta-2M level of 3.0 mg/L or greater was 36% compared with 71% for those with a level of less than 3.0 mg/L. Using multivariate analysis that tested beta-2M as a continuous variable, it was selected as the most significant factor for complete response. The adjusted odds ratio was 0.285 (95% CI, 0.101 to 0.809). The Ann Arbor stage had marginal significance (adjusted odds ratio, 0.435; CI, 0.150 to 1.263). For time to treatment failure, beta-2M was the only variable retained in the multivariate model. At 42 months, no patient with a beta-2M level of 3.0 mg/L or greater was projected to be in remission as compared with 85% of patients with a beta-2M level of less than 3.0 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: The serum beta-2M level is a good predictor of complete response and time to treatment failure. A larger number of patients should be studied to clarify the role of other potentially independent variables such as stage and age.\r"

At the time of diagnosis of M. kansasii infection, the median CD4+ lymphocyte count was 49 cells/microL (range, 0 to 198 cells/microL), and 16 of 19 patients had a previous diagnosis of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). All 17 patients with pulmonary infection presented with fever and cough of at least 2 weeks duration. Chest radiographs showed either focal upper lobe infiltrates (n = 8) or diffuse interstitial infiltrates (n = 9); 9 patients also had thin-walled cavitary lesions. Nine patients with pulmonary M. kansasii infection were treated with antituberculosis chemotherapy, with resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms, improvement of radiographic infiltrates, and sputum conversion; 1 patient with M. kansasii osteomyelitis also responded to antituberculosis therapy. Autopsies done on 3 treated patients did not reveal any evidence of M. kansasii infection. Nine patients did not receive any antituberculosis chemotherapy; 2 untreated patients developed progressive cavitary pulmonary disease and died from M. kansasii pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Mycobacterium kansasii causes serious and potentially life-threatening pulmonary disease in patients with advanced HIV-related immunosuppression. In contrast to previous reports, our findings indicate that disease produced by M. kansasii in patients with HIV infection is responsive to antituberculosis chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether isosorbide-5-mononitrate (Is-5-Mn) given with propranolol reduces hepatic portal pressure more than does propranolol alone in patients with cirrhosis. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS: Fifty patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices entered and 42 completed the study. INTERVENTION: Twenty-one patients received oral propranolol at increasing doses until their resting heart rate was reduced by 25%, and 21 patients received oral propranolol (on the same schedule) plus oral Is-5-Mn, 40 mg twice a day. MEASUREMENTS: Hepatic vein pressure gradient, liver function, and splanchnic and systemic hemodynamics before and after 3 months of continuous therapy. MAIN RESULTS: At 3 months, the hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased more (P less than 0.01) in patients given propranolol plus Is-5-Mn (19%, from 18.4 +/- 3.9 to 14.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg; 95% CI, -2.4 to -4.5 mm Hg) than in those given propranolol alone (10%, from 18.2 +/- 3.5 to 16.3 +/- 3.1 mm Hg; CI, -1.1 to -2.7 mm Hg). The hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased by more than 20% of the baseline value in 10% of patients receiving propranolol, but in 50% of patients receiving combined therapy (P less than 0.02). There were statistically significant decreases in hepatic blood flow and the intrinsic clearance of indocyanine green after propranolol therapy, but not after combined therapy. The treatments caused similar reductions in azygos blood flow and cardiac output. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term combined administration of propranolol plus Is-5-Mn reduces portal pressure more than propranolol alone without adverse effects on hepatic perfusion and liver function. Whether this greater hemodynamic effect translates into better clinical efficacy should be determined in randomized controlled trials.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To review the status of emergency, urgent, routine, and selective angiography after intravenous thrombolytic therapy. DATA SOURCES: Relevant English-language articles published from January 1985 to July 1990 were identified through MEDLINE. STUDY SELECTION: For emergency angiography, four major randomized studies were reviewed and data from nine studies that incorporated rescue coronary angioplasty were pooled for meta-analysis. For urgent angiography, two controlled trials were reviewed. Comparisons of routine and selective angiography were done using data from two dedicated, large-scale, controlled trials and the ancillary findings of four other studies of reperfusion that incorporated angiography. DATA EXTRACTION: The review emphasizes the findings from multicenter, randomized, controlled trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Emergency coronary angiography is done primarily in preparation for primary or rescue angioplasty; the value of rescue angioplasty has yet to be assessed in a randomized trial, but technical success and reocclusion improve significantly after therapy with nonspecific plasminogen activators compared with relatively specific agents (success rate, 86% compared with 75%, respectively; P = 0.03; reocclusion rate, 10.9% compared with 26.8%, respectively; P less than 0.001). Urgent coronary angiography has value for treating recurrent ischemia, but patients who develop this complication after thrombolysis are likely to have a suboptimal outcome despite aggressive care. Studies support the use of either selective or routine angiography in uncomplicated patients after thrombolytic therapy; either approach is acceptable, but the former is more practical and may prove to be cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal follow-up for patients with evolving myocardial infarction who receive thrombolysis may incorporate coronary angiography at various stages. Although our ability to noninvasively detect reperfusion, reocclusion, or viable but ischemic myocardium is limited at present, available data may assist in selecting a catheterization strategy.\r"

  ".U": "91196998\r", 
  ".W": "Diuretic drugs usually improve edema when used judiciously. Some patients, however, become resistant to their effects. Diuretic resistance may result from dietary indiscretion, poor compliance, impaired bioavailability, imparied diuretic secretion into the lumen of the renal tubule, or because other drugs interfere with diuretic activity. When easily treatable causes of diuretic resistance have been excluded, resistance often reflects the intensity of the stimuli to sodium retention. Recent experimental work has indicated ways in which the kidney adapts to chronic diuretic treatment and has indicated how these adaptations may limit diuretic effectiveness. First, nephron segments downstream from the site of diuretic action increase sodium-chloride (NaCl) reabsorption because the delivered NaCl load increases. Second, diuretic-induced contraction of the extracellular fluid volume stimulates kidney tubules to retain NaCl until the next dose of diuretic is administered. Third, kidney tubules themselves may become hypertrophic because they are chronically stimulated by diuretic-induced increases in NaCl delivery. These adaptations all increase the rate of NaCl reabsorption and blunt the effectiveness of diuretic therapy. When diuretic resistance is present, using a second diuretic drug that acts in a different nephron segment is often effective. Recent experimental results suggest that a second class of drug may act synergistically with the first by blocking the adaptive processes that limit diuretic effectiveness. On the basis of an understanding of the mechanisms of diuretic adaptation and resistance, treatment regimens can be designed to block specific adaptive mechanisms and to improve diuretic therapy.\r"

The Court held that the Constitution protects the refusal of life-sustaining treatment by competent patients. For incompetent patients, states may require \"clear and convincing\" evidence of refusal, specifically for the withdrawal of tube feedings, if such a person were in a persistent vegetative state. The ruling left many clinical questions unanswered, such as whether life-sustaining treatment must be given to terminally ill incompetent patients, whether patients may refuse artificial feedings, and what constitutes clear and convincing evidence of refusal. The decision also has potentially harmful consequences. It may undermine family decision making, encourage cynicism and disregard of the law, and promote defensive medicine. Physicians can minimize such consequences by encouraging patients to provide advance directives, such as the durable power of attorney for health care, by urging legislative action, and by setting national practice standards for decisions regarding incompetent patients.\r"

  ".W": "Aminoglycosides are usually considered to be concentration-dependent antibiotics and to have similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. To verify the equivalent activity of the aminoglycosides on a susceptible strain, we tested the killing rate of three aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin) on one strain of Serratia marcescens both in vitro and in vivo by using a rabbit model of left-ventricle endocarditis. Despite, similar MICs, the time-kill curve of gentamicin was consistently better than those of amikacin and tobramycin, whatever the concentration of each antibiotic used (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg/liter), after a 5-h incubation. The in vivo bacterial reduction in the vegetations was measured 24 h after administration of an intravenous 48-mg/kg bolus of each antibiotic or at the end of a 24-h continuous intravenous infusion of the same dose. Gentamicin was significantly more effective when administered as a bolus than when administered as a continuous infusion (2.8 +/- 0.2 versus 6.4 +/- 1.5 log10 CFU/g of vegetation, respectively; P less than 0.01), whereas amikacin was more effective as a continuous infusion than as a bolus injection (3.6 +/- 2.0 versus 7.5 +/- 1.3 log10 CFU/g of vegetation, respectively; P less than 0.01). Tobramycin was not very effective, whatever the dosage tested (approximately 6.5 to 7 log10 CFU/g). These results suggest that concentration-dependent bactericidal activities, both in vitro and in vivo, may vary greatly among aminoglycosides despite similar MICs.\r"

Lolans, and D. M. Livermore, J. Infect. Dis. 162:414-420, 1990; G. G. Jackson, G. L. Daikos, and V. T. Lolans, J. Infect. Dis. 162:408-413, 1990). The therapeutic implications were examined in netilmicin treatment of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of normal and neutropenic mice. For 2 h after the first dose, the bactericidal rates were rapid, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.5 log10 CFU/h with doses of 10, 30, and 60 mg/kg, respectively. Each twofold increase in dosage reduced the number of surviving bacteria fivefold. Between 2 and 6 h, the second-phase bactericidal rate was slow, less than or equal to 0.3 log10 CFU/h, regardless of the dose. In a multiple-dose regimen, the same amount of netilmicin given in one dose was 70 and 90% more effective than two or three doses, respectively. Doses calculated to keep the drug level in plasma above the MIC were less effective than regimens giving first exposure to a high drug concentration. Adaptive resistance occurred when doses were given more than 2 h after the start of treatment. Temporary survival of bacteremic neutropenic mice was 60 to 70% greater with a second dose at 2 h than after a longer interval. In a thigh infection of neutropenic mice treated every 2 h, doses 4, 6, and 8 h after the first one showed no bactericidal effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
