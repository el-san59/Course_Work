  ".W": "Physiologic activation response patterning, termed activation peaking, and visuospatial learning performance were examined to understand the effects of chronic alcohol use on complex information processing. A total of 18 alcoholic male inpatients in an alcoholism treatment unit served as participants. Nine persons were seen while intoxicated (mean blood alcohol level [BAL] = 18.0mg/dl) at time of admission to the unit. The second group of nine persons were seen detoxified after 4 weeks in the treatment unit (BAL = 0 mg/dl). Skin conductance and heart rate were measured before and during learning. Learning consisted of a paired-associate paradigm requiring participants to learn the distinct spatial positions of six randomly presented \"nonsense\" shapes. The visuospatial learning of the intoxicated alcoholics was superior to that of the detoxified alcoholics. The physiological patterning of intoxicated alcoholics clearly and correctly tracked their learning performance, while the detoxified alcoholics displayed no clear pattern. The results indicated that the detoxified alcoholic may suffer a disruption in attentional mechanisms related to visuospatial information processing, providing support for theory that alcohol ingestion may serve to balance information processing in the alcoholic.\r"

The weekly recall method consisted of a personal interview with questions about actual alcohol consumption on the previous 7 days. The diary consisted of 14 daily self-reports of consumption and followed the interview. The diary method yields estimates of consumption that are on average 22% higher than those based on weekly recall measures, reducing total undercoverage by about 11%. The difference between the two methods cannot be attributed to a variation of consumption over weeks but seems to stem from a difference in accuracy of recall. There was an increase in glasses underreported at the upper levels of consumption, but underreporting did not seem to be of a nonlinear nature. Considering the large individual variation in consumption over weeks, the ranking of individuals according to their self-reports is relatively stable across method.\r"

To determine if such recovery in alcoholics under age 40 may be accelerated by training with components of an initially impaired task (Trails B), this study employed four groups of alcoholics (N = 53) and a group of matched controls (N = 13). Two alcoholic groups received two consecutive cognitive remediation sessions during the latter 2 weeks of a 1-month treatment program, and two groups of alcoholics received no remediation. Results confirmed that recovery of visuospatial problem-solving skills is facilitated by training with task components (experience-dependent recovery) while spontaneous recovery during the first month of abstinence is minimal for this task. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of cognitive remediation in reversing some alcohol-induced cognitive impairment and have important implications for improving alcohol treatment outcome and adaptive functioning.\r"

The present study examined whether active follow-up methods do aid in engaging the alcoholic in treatment, whether such procedures improve treatment outcome and how much responsibility the therapist must be willing to assume in order to maintain the patient in treatment. Appointment keeping was significantly improved by a home-visit follow-up method in the first 6 months postdischarge (p less than .01). However, there was no one-to-one correspondence between improved therapy attendance and improved treatment outcome. When subjects were classified into treatment dropout and treatment completion groups, however, a treatment effect was achieved. The most intensive follow-up condition increased the probability of treatment completion, supporting to some degree the utility of aggressive follow-up. However, it was concluded that the cost of such procedures probably will limit their use since a significant economic variable (number of days hospitalized during the follow-up year) was not affected by type of aftercare.\r"

Treatment completers were found to attend over 90% of their scheduled daily appointments and drinking during the treatment term was infrequent. The average duration for completed treatments was approximately 5 appointment days. Treatment noncompleters also attended their scheduled appointments regularly prior to discontinuation and, except for several patients who were transferred to inpatient treatment because of continued drinking, drinking during detoxication was relatively infrequent. The short-term outcome and safety of treatment noncompleters was reviewed. No instance of serious medical or psychiatric consequences following discontinuation from treatment was revealed. It was concluded that discontinuation of treatment by a patient is not in all cases indicative of a poor outcome. It was further concluded that ambulatory medical detoxication is a relatively successful treatment for mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal symptomatology and for patients not requiring immediate medical or psychiatric attention.\r"

A sample of 266 alcoholics were evaluated at intake and 1 year following inpatient treatment using an extensive battery of assessments. Correlational analysis and factor analysis provided limited support for both the unidimensional and multidimensional approaches. A synthetic measure of posttreatment drinking showed a clear linear relationship between level of consumption and lack of improvement in medical status, biological function, life stress and psychopathology. The findings are discussed in terms of the methodological difficulties in treatment evaluation and the need for more systematic research on the effect of posttreatment drinking on multiple dimensions of outcome status.\r"

Standardized ratings at first admission indicated that the delirium patients had lower frequencies of depressive symptomatology, personality disturbance and social complications. Slight cerebral impairment at first admission was more frequent in the delirium patients, perhaps indicating a more severe abuse. In a subsample of 105 personally followed-up patients it was found that subjects with delirium later during the course of their illness were characterized by a lower level of social stability at first admission, compared with those with an initial delirium or with no history of delirium tremens. Contrary to initial delirium, later delirium was related to an unfavorable course. Six subjects with a history of delirium tremens were found to have taken up social drinking. Patterns and processes of improvement were found to be related more to background characteristics in terms of personality disturbance and social stability than to the severity of withdrawal symptoms.\r"

The patients selected for this treatment were identified at high risk to develop malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Precise vaporization of the affected mucosa were carried out using the Cavitron 40-300-A CO2 Surgical Laser. Destruction of the surface epithelium and submucosa was achieved by using defocused beam at a setting of 10W. Biopsies were taken at 1 cm intervals at the time of laser treatment. Fourteen of the 20 procedures were carried out under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis. Seven procedures were performed under general anesthesia and 2 patients required 24 h postoperative observation. Local control was achieved in 17 of the 20 treated sites. Two of the three treatment failures occurred in patients in whom the final histology revealed either in situ or invasive squamous carcinoma. Only one patient with dysplasia was not controlled after vaporization of the lesion by the carbon dioxide laser. The laser continues to show encouraging results as an alternative to surgical resection of precancerous mucosal lesions of the oral cavity. Vaporization of the dysplastic lesion(s) with carbon dioxide laser is recommended for patients with an identifiable risk for the development of intraoral malignancy. This is an effective, nonmorbid, inexpensive, quick, and relatively painless method of managing this condition.\r"

Eighty percent of ovarian and all the testicular germ cell tumors were malignant. Thirty per cent of the tumors were located in the sacrococcyx. The ovaries were the next common site. There were 80 girls, 53 boys, and 2 cases in which the sex was not recorded. The predominance amongst girls was mainly due to the more frequent involvement of ovaries as compared to the testes. Twenty nine of the children were in the first year of life. The factors probably responsible for the higher incidence of malignancy, the differences in anatomic location, and the sex distribution in comparison to other reports have been examined and discussed.\r"

There was no histologic evidence of acute bowel, liver, or kidney damage. There were significant differences in temperatures at the various sites. The average small bowel temperature was significantly higher than predicated by the free peritoneal probe or than seen in the liver or kidney. The large bowel temperatures averaged higher than the free peritoneal probe temperatures, but the difference was not significant. Liver and kidney temperatures approximate whole body temperature due to extensive vascular network. Although the elevated small bowel temperatures may be due in part to different position in relation to isotherms, the frequent occurrence of a large temperature difference suggests focal heating of fluid pockets in the small bowel.\r"

Ninety-five patients with generalized myasthenia gravis underwent \"maximal\" thymectomy consecutively between 1977 and 1985 and were evaluated 6 months to 89 months after operation. In Group A (N = 72), myasthenia gravis without thymoma, the uncorrected data revealed that 96% (69) had benefited from operation: 79% (57) had no symptoms; 46% (33) were in remission; 33% (24) were symptom free when receiving minimal doses of pyridostigmine; and none were worse. Life table analysis yielded a remission rate of 81% at 89 months. In group B (N = 8), myasthenia gravis without thymoma for which patients underwent reexploration for incapacitating weakness after earlier transcervical or transsternal operations, residual thymus was found in all. One patient was in remission, two were symptom free when receiving medication, one was unchanged, and none were worse. In group C (N 15), myasthenia gravis and thymoma, two patients were in remission and nine were symptom free when receiving medication. Two patients in this group died 2 and 4 years postoperatively in crisis. Response to thymectomy in group A was greater in patients with mild myasthenia gravis and may have been better in patients who had symptoms for less than 60 months preoperatively, but the response did not depend on age, sex, presence or absence of thymic hyperplasia or involution, or titers of acetylcholine receptor antibodies. The response to thymectomy in group B was striking but slower than in group A, perhaps because symptoms were more severe and of longer duration. The response in group C was also less good than in group A and proportionately fewer benefited. These results support the recommendation for thymectomy in the treatment of patients with generalized myasthenia gravis and indicate the desirability of a maximal procedure. For persistent or recurrent severe symptoms after previous transcervical or submaximal transsternal resections, reoperation by this technique is also recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Oxygen-derived free radicals and intracellular calcium overload have been implicated as mediators of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. We hypothesized that free radical scavengers or calcium channel blockers could enhance the protection afforded the isolated, working rat heart by crystalloid cardioplegia against this type of injury at 37 degrees C. Hearts from 42 male rats in seven groups (n = 6) were studied in an isolated, working heart preparation measuring aortic flow (ml/min/gm dry wt), peak systolic pressure (mm Hg), coronary artery flow (ml/min/gm dry wt), and calculated coronary vascular resistance (dyne.sec.cm-5/gm dry wt). Creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase release were measured before ischemia and at various times during the postischemic reperfusion period. Time-matched control hearts (group 1) were perfused for 2 hours. After finding that 30 minutes of ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion (group 2) produced significant (p less than 0.01) functional impairment that was completely protected (group 3) by a preischemic bolus of St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution, we again found significant (p less than 0.01) functional impairment after 40 minutes of ischemia and 10 minutes (group 4) or 20 minutes (group 5) of reperfusion despite a preischemic bolus of St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution. Diltiazem (10 mg/L) plus St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution (group 6) did not significantly (p less than 0.01) enhance functional recovery. Addition of superoxide dismutase plus catalase (200 microns/ml) (group 7) produced marked improvement in functional recovery that did not differ significantly (p less than 0.01) from control results (group 1). The creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase data strongly supported the preceding functional data. Coronary flow and vascular resistance were not significantly (p less than 0.01) changed from control values in any group. We conclude that the addition of superoxide dismutase and catalase but not diltiazem to St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution can significantly enhance myocardial protection against normothermic ischemia/reperfusion injury. This implicates oxygen-derived free radicals as mediators of this type of injury.\r"

  ".W": "Neonatal and adult myocardium respond differently to ischemia. In addition, the neonatal heart possesses a limited preload reserve. The effect of uninterrupted hypothermic ischemia on recovery of left ventricular function and preload reserve was studied in two groups of isolated rabbit hearts: group 1 (neonates, n = 8), 7 to 10 days old; group 2 (adults, n = 15), 6 to 12 months old. Peak left ventricular systolic pressure, the first derivative of left ventricular systolic pressure, and heart rate were measured at left ventricular pressures of 0, 5, 10, and 15 mm Hg before and after 120 minutes of global ischemia at 27 degrees C. Before ischemia, left ventricular systolic pressure increased significantly at each increment of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure for both groups of hearts. After hypothermic ischemia, recovery of left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced at each level of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure among neonatal hearts (range 75% to 79% of control values). The postischemic recovery of left ventricular systolic pressure in the adult hearts was markedly reduced from baseline values (range 43% to 53% of control values) and was significantly worse than that of neonatal hearts at each level of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.001). Both groups were able to respond to increasing preload after ischemia. The slope of the curve describing the relationship between left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and percent recovery of left ventricular systolic pressure was not different from zero for neonatal hearts but was significantly greater than zero among the adults (0.22 +/- 0.21 versus 0.73 +/- 0.07, p = 0.0056). After ischemia, the first derivative of left ventricular systolic pressure fell significantly from control values among neonatal hearts (71% of control values). The reduction was considerably greater, however, among the adult hearts (54% of control values). These data indicate that the neonatal heart recovers systolic function better than the adult heart after global ischemia with moderate hypothermia.\r"

  ".W": "Late results were reviewed in 220 survivors after atrial correction of transposition of the great arteries who were operated between 1964 and 1985. Senning's procedure and its various modifications have been used; all patients who survived 30 days after correction were included in this analysis. Average follow-up for the whole group was 10.3 years; 113 patients were observed for 10 years, 26 patients for 15 years, and 8 patients for 20 years. The actuarial survival rate for the whole group was 89% at 10 years, 87% at 15 years, 82% at 20 years. It was higher in simple than in complex transposition (92% versus 84% at 10 years). Sudden deaths (8 patients) and late heart failure (6 patients) were the principal causes of death, predominantly in the complex transposition group (10/13 deaths). Late survival was more common in the latter part of the study, with 95% of patients operated on after 1978 surviving 9 years as opposed to 84% of patients operated on earlier. Late reoperation was necessary in 18 patients (8%), with 12 reoperations occurring within 2 years after correction. Cumulative reoperation rate reached 11.7% after 10 years. Reoperations were more common in complex than in simple transposition (14% versus 6%, p less than 0.05). Late arrhythmias can occur after atrial correction, and the cumulative incidence of pacemaker implantations was 8% at 10 years. Most of the survivors are functionally free of symptoms (83% of the simple and 75% of the complex transposition group). Significant tricuspid valve incompetence was encountered in only three patients, with two valve reconstructions being possible. In summary, long-term outlook for survivors of atrial correction for transposition of the great arteries remains encouraging, although complex transposition does seem to engender more late problems. Atrial correction is still warranted in simple transposition, but close cardiological surveillance is necessary.\r"

  ".W": "The risk of bilateral internal mammary artery grafting was studied in three groups of patients who were computer matched for recognized risk factors: year of operation, age, gender, extent of coronary artery disease, left ventricular function, completeness of myocardial revascularization, and history of congestive heart failure. The patient groups differed in the fact that they received veins only, one internal mammary artery graft, or two internal mammary artery grafts. The operative mortality rates for these three groups were 1.8%, 0.3%, and 0.9%, respectively (no significant difference). Analysis of perioperative morbidity demonstrated no significant differences except for a slight increase in transfusion requirements in the group receiving two internal mammary artery grafts (p = 0.04). None of the patients with only vein grafts had wound complications. One patient in the group with one internal mammary artery graft had a wound complication (0.03%). Eight patients receiving two internal mammary artery grafts had wound complications (2.4%) (p = 0.002). The prevalence of wound complications in patients with diabetes mellitus was 5.7% and in those without diabetes mellitus, 0.3% (p = 0.01). The prevalence of wound complications in patients less than 60 years of age was 0.2%, in patients in their 60s, 1.6%, and in patients older than 70, 3.1% (p = 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified diabetes mellitus and age and not bilateral internal mammary artery grafting as risk factors for wound complications. We conclude that bilateral internal mammary artery grafting does not increase surgical mortality and increases surgical morbidity by a slight increase in the mean transfusion requirement.\r"

The aim of this work was to assess the effectiveness of this operation by using a radionuclide pharyngeal emptying study as a new quantitative method in addition to clinical and manometric evaluation. Radionuclide study was performed with the patient in both the upright and the supine positions after ingestion of 15 ml of water labeled with sulfur colloid 99mTc. Computerized data were acquired at 0.5 second intervals for 15 minutes and a pharyngeal time-activity curve was generated. Four quantitative parameters were evaluated: the time for pharyngeal clearance of 25%, 50%, and 75% of the ingested radioactive water and the pharyngeal stasis at 15 minutes. Manometric studies were also performed before and after cricopharyngeal myotomy. The pharyngeal clearance of 25%, 50%, and 75% of the water and pharyngeal stasis at 15 minutes were all improved by cricopharyngeal myotomy, decreasing from 1.2 to 0.9 second (p less than 0.04), 4.2 to 2 seconds (p less than 0.005), 15 to 7 seconds (p less than 0.02), and 10.3% to 6% (p less than 0.01), respectively. Both pharyngoesophageal and tracheobronchial symptoms were also significantly improved by cricopharyngeal myotomy. Manometric evaluation showed a decrease of the upper esophageal sphincter closing pressure from 60.1 mm Hg before to 28.2 mm Hg after the operation (p less than 0.001), and the resting pressure decreased from 34.4 to 15.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.0005). Cricopharyngeal myotomy significantly improves both symptoms and pharyngeal emptying in patients with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.\r"

Mediastinal lymph node size was correlated with operative and pathologic findings. There was close agreement between computed tomographic estimate of size and operative measurements. Mediastinal lymph nodes that were larger than 2.0 cm were positive for tumor in 69.6%, nodes between 1.1 and 1.9 cm contained metastases in 31.8%, and nodes less than 1.0 cm were positive in only 2.7%. The cell type, T status, and location of the primary tumor did not influence these findings: A node less than 1.0 cm with a T3 lesion had the same probability of being abnormal as with a T1 lesion, although predictably, those patients with T3 and central tumors had a greater likelihood of having nodes larger than 2.0 cm. The presence of pneumonitis did not increase the prevalence of enlarged, histologically normal nodes. Asymptomatic adrenal metastases were present in 3.2% of patients with otherwise operable disease and were suggested only by the computed tomographic scan. Patients with mediastinal nodes less than 1.0 cm probably do not need preresection mediastinal exploration. Those with nodes larger than 2.0 cm should not be considered unresectable without pathologic confirmation, even in large tumors, in view of the 30.4% negativity rate. The computed tomographic scan is useful in depicting and localizing enlarged mediastinal nodes but cannot be used as a substitute for pathologic examination.\r"

  ".W": "On the basis of recent investigation, controversy has arisen regarding which of several cardiopulmonary resuscitation methods optimizes hemodynamics. The present study was designed to compare five recently described chest compression techniques: high-impulse manual chest compression at 150/min, mechanical compression at 60/min with simultaneous ventilation, mechanical compression at 60/min with simultaneous ventilation and either systolic or diastolic abdominal compression, and pneumatic vest compression at 60/min. Eight dogs were chronically instrumented with electromagnetic flow probes in the ascending and descending aorta while matched micromanometers measured aortic, left ventricular, and pleural pressures. At study, each dog was anesthetized with morphine, intubated, and the heart was fibrillated by rapid ventricular pacing. The five cardiopulmonary resuscitation methods were performed randomly in each preparation within 7 to 10 minutes of arrest. In four dogs, brachiocephalic blood flow was computed as total cardiac output minus descending aortic blood flow, and in all dogs coronary perfusion pressure was calculated as mean diastolic aortic pressure minus mean diastolic left ventricular pressure. Average cardiac output for seven studies was 662 +/- 61 ml/min with high-impulse manual compression, 340 +/- 46 ml/min with mechanical compression and simultaneous ventilation, 336 +/- 45 ml/min with mechanical compression and simultaneous ventilation with systolic abdominal compression, 366 +/- 52 ml/min with mechanical compression and simultaneous ventilation with diastolic abdominal compression, and 196 +/- 29 ml/min with vest resuscitation (high-impulse manual compression significantly greater than other techniques by multivariate analysis, p less than 0.05). Brachiocephalic blood flow generally followed cardiac output and was statistically the greatest with high-impulse manual compression at 273 +/- 47 ml/min (p less than 0.05). Finally, high-impulse manual compression provided the highest coronary perfusion pressure of 31 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) compared to 23 +/- 2 mm Hg for mechanical compression and simultaneous ventilation, 23 +/- 2 mm Hg for mechanical compression and simultaneous ventilation with systolic abdominal compression, 23 +/- 3 mm Hg for mechanical compression and simultaneous ventilation with diastolic abdominal compression, and 11 +/- 2 mm Hg for vest resuscitation. These data demonstrate that high-impulse manual compression generated physiologically and statistically superior hemodynamics when compared with other methods in this model of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\r"

There were no operative deaths but two patients (6%) died late. The remaining 29 patients were alive and well when last seen, with no signs of residual shunt and with good valve function. The high prevalence of late complications necessitates routine investigation of patients with penetrating injuries of the heart and the aorta. Surgical correction carries a low mortality and morbidity and is advised in all patients with symptoms.\r"

Group 3 served as a control with 10 sheep that had tricuspid valve replacement with a trileaflet porcine bioprosthesis. Hemodynamic performance was satisfactory in all three groups despite prominent pathologic changes, particularly in unileaflet valves. Intrinsic cuspal calcification was present in 66% of the unileaflet tricuspid, 88% unileaflet mitral, and 25% porcine tricuspid valves. Neither cuspal tearing nor perforations were found. However, cuspal stretching and redundancy of the mobile cusp was present in six tricuspid, seven mitral unileaflet valves, and no porcine valves. Gross pericardial redundancy correlated with the microscopic appearance of distorted and separated collagen bundles. These findings suggest that multiple modes of primary tissue failure may limit the durability of this unileaflet pericardial valve.\r"

We investigated the effects of dopamine, sodium nitroprusside, and sodium thiopental in this model. Proximal and distal aortic pressures and cerebrospinal fluid pressure were measured during occlusion in 12 adult mongrel dogs under control conditions and during drug interventions. Spinal cord function was assessed by spinal somatosensory evoked potentials recorded during 3-minute intervals of reversible spinal cord ischemia. By multiple regression analysis, the degree of spinal cord ischemia was positively related to the cerebrospinal fluid pressure (p = 0.0092) and negatively related to the percent change in cerebrospinal fluid pressure (p = 0.028); there were no significant drug effects on cerebrospinal fluid pressure or on the degree of spinal cord ischemia. This study indicates that cerebrospinal fluid pressure is an important factor in determining the degree of spinal cord ischemia during aortic occlusion and suggests that measures to reduce cerebrospinal fluid pressure will mitigate the degree of spinal cord ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro velocity and turbulent shear stress fields created by three new mechanical valve designs (size 27 mm) were studied in the aortic position under pulsatile flow conditions. The following valves were studied: Bjork-Shiley Monostrut tilting disc, Omni-Carbon tilting disc, and Duromedics bileaflet. All three valve designs created low pressure gradients with effective orifice areas in the range of 3.10 to 3.90 cm2. Both tilting disc designs created major and minor orifice jets, which were asymmetric in size. The peak velocities of the major and minor orifice jets were, however, of the same magnitude (200 cm/sec). The Omni-Carbon valve created a more even flow distribution through the minor orifice compared with the Bjork-Shiley design. Regions of stagnation/flow separation were observed immediately adjacent (ie, distal) to the minor orifice strut and the pivot guards of the Bjork-Shiley and Omni-Carbon valve designs, respectively. The Duromedics valve created relatively centralized flow. However, a major portion of the flow occurred through the two lateral orifices. Regions of flow separation/stagnation were observed adjacent to the valve sewing ring in the area of the valve pivot (hinge) mechanism. All three valve designs did create elevated turbulent shear stresses, with peak values in the range of 1000 to 2000 dynes/cm2 and mean values in the range of 100 to 1000 dynes/cm2. Such elevated shear stresses could cause sublethal and/or lethal damage to cellular blood elements. In an overall analysis, these new-generation low-profile mechanical valves are hemodynamically comparable to the Medtronic Hall and St. Jude Medical mechanical valves and are superior to the older-generation mechanical valves. However, it is unlikely that these valve designs will eliminate the problems of thrombosis, thromboembolic complications, and hemolysis.\r"

Standard criteria for diagnosis were applied. We identified 140 (128 female and 12 male) residents of the community who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa. No significant long-term trend in rates was ascertained. The overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate was 7.3 per 100,000 person-years. The highest age-specific incidence rate (56.7 per 100,000 person-years) occurred in female residents 15 to 19 years old. The prevalence rate on Jan. 1, 1980, for Rochester residents with a history of the disease, age- and sex-adjusted to the 1970 US white population, was 113.1 per 100,000 (203.9 for female and 16.9 for male residents).\r"

In all three patients, the lesions caused symptomatic vertebral pain and developed during a period of only a few months. All patients had extremely elevated levels of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, and two patients had evidence of severe hyperparathyroidism on bone biopsy specimens. Two patients who underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy had rapid relief of symptoms and no further radiographic evidence of progression of the spondyloarthropathy. The third patient refused subtotal parathyroidectomy and had pronounced progression of the destructive spondyloarthropathy in the cervical spine. The limited experience of others, along with our currently reported findings, strongly suggests that hyperparathyroidism plays a major role in the development of this disorder. Erosive spondyloarthropathy is increasingly recognized in long-term dialysis patients and may be a unique clinical and radiographic manifestation of severe hyperparathyroidism in this population.\r"

  ".W": "Although an association between gallstones and pancreatitis has been recognized for almost 100 years, the risk of acute pancreatitis in patients with gallstones and the effect of cholecystectomy on this risk have been unknown. The complete medical records of the 2,583 residents of Rochester, Minnesota, who had gallstones diagnosed between 1950 and 1970 were carefully reviewed to detect the development of acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis developed in only 89 subjects (3.4% of the cohort); however, the relative risk for acute pancreatitis (before cholecystectomy) was increased 14 to 35 times in men and 12 to 25 times in women. The overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence of acute pancreatitis of the members of the cohort before cholecystectomy was 6.3 to 14.8 per 1,000 person-years of follow-up. Cholecystectomy in 1,560 patients without a prior attack of pancreatitis reduced the relative risk to 1.9 and 2.0 for men and women respectively. Of 58 patients who had a cholecystectomy after an attack of acute pancreatitis and underwent follow-up for a median of 15 years postoperatively, only 2 had another attack of acute pancreatitis, and the cause of the pancreatitis was unrelated to gallstones in both. In summary, patients with gallstones have a considerably increased relative risk for acute pancreatitis and, regardless of whether prior attacks of pancreatitis have occurred, cholecystectomy reduces this risk to almost the same level as in the general population. Because the overall incidence of pancreatitis is low, however, performance of cholecystectomy to prevent pancreatitis is indicated only if an attack of acute pancreatitis has already occurred.\r"

The diastasis was closed with prosthetic mesh through a preperitoneal approach. In patients in whom a scrotal hernia develops after a previous pelvic fracture, especially those with evidence of a pubic diastasis, an unusual type of hernia should be suspected. A preperitoneal surgical approach best reveals the anatomy and allows appropriate repair. The best procedure for prevention of such hernias is primary reduction of any substantial pubic diastasis, but operative intervention is not indicated in all patients.\r"

To date, 28 patients with at least two of these individually unusual or rare neoplasms have been described. This updated case report of one of the originally described patients with Carney's triad highlights several clinically important features of this unusual syndrome: (1) the multicentricity of both the paragangliomas and the epithelioid leiomyosarcomas, (2) the often indolent progression of metastatic leiomyosarcoma, (3) the potential for late recurrences, and (4) the importance of distinguishing intra-adrenal from periadrenal catecholamine-producing tumors (paragangliomas). Localization of paragangliomas is facilitated by two relatively new techniques--131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scanning (a scintigraphic technique with high specificity for catecholamine-producing tumors) and two-dimensional echocardiography (which can noninvasively localize and demonstrate the anatomic relationships of aorticopulmonary paragangliomas). In patients with this syndrome, new or recurrent tumors frequently manifest after unusually long asymptomatic intervals. We outline an approach for continued follow-up of patients with one or more of the three neoplasms that constitute the syndrome. Rigorous long-term screening of these patients should not only lead to early recognition and resection of recurrent or new tumors but also enhance our understanding of this intriguing syndrome.\r"

These healthy humans, ranging from 18 to 82 years old and from 43 to 171 kg in weight, were mentally and physically active. Body composition was determined by densitometry and skinfold thickness. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to determine whether one or several variables best predicted RMR. Body compositional variables reflecting active protoplasmic tissue were all highly interrelated. Body weight alone yielded prediction values for RMR comparable to those of other variables of active protoplasmic tissue mass. Among these mentally and physically active women and men, the influence of age on RMR was trivial, and regional distribution of fat had no influence on the RMR. The 95% confidence limits for RMR in both lean and obese subjects were broad. Thus, metabolic efficiency is not necessarily or exclusively related to obesity. In fact, the caloric requirements of humans, based on body weight or active protoplasmic tissue mass, may vary twofold. With the exception of the elderly men, the classic prediction equations and tables developed during the first half of this century greatly overestimated the RMR of healthy lean and obese humans. Therefore, new regression equations for predicting the RMR based on weight and fat-free mass were developed.\r"

ABR was repeated postoperatively in 18 patients. There were no statistically significant differences in the ABRs of preoperative OSA patients when compared with the control group. However, the preoperative recordings showed statistically significant prolonged latencies for wave III (p less than 0.01) and interpeak latency (IPL) I-III (p less than 0.01) when compared to postoperative recordings. Rapid-rate testing was not helpful. Although normal sleep does not cause ABR abnormalities, the pathological sleepiness seen in OSA patients may cause brainstem dysfunction manifested by prolonged ABR latencies. These abnormalities may resolve with treatment of OSA.\r"

Questionnaire responses indicated that 97% of the Meniere's disease patients and 68% of the non-Meniere's disease patients experienced a substantial improvement or resolution of their vertiginous symptoms. Hearing was maintained within 10 dB of the preoperative level in the majority of the patients. Neurological complications were limited to 2 cases of meningitis which resolved with medical therapy, 7 cases of cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and 3 cases of complete sensorineural hearing loss.

Even in the four patients with a history of an \"event\" that could implicate a fistula such as exertion or barotrauma, a fistula was found in only one. There are a number of possible causes for progression of a preexisting SNHL, and surgical exploration of the middle ear should not be recommended on the basis of progression alone. Instead, exploration for a suspected PLF should be strongly considered when there is also a history of an \"event\", and/or radiographic evidence of inner-ear abnormalities.

  ".W": "Of 1,700 patients with facial paralysis seen in a retrospective study from 1969 through 1977 and 280 patients seen prospectively from 1983 through 1986, 7.1% had recurrence of Bell's palsy. In this group, the frequency of ipsilateral recurrence was equal to that for contralateral recurrence. The mean age at onset of Bell's palsy was 33.0 years; Bell's palsy recurred a mean of 9.8 years later. Recurrent facial paralysis did not indicate a worse prognosis for recovery regardless of which side was affected. There was no statistical difference between results for male patients or female patients, nor was there a statistically significant sex predominance, except in the age group 10 to 19 years. In our results, computed tomography (CT) scan in patients with recurrent Bell's palsy detected no facial-nerve neuroma. Of 77 patients followed a mean of 33 years after the first episode (range, 2.8 to 60 years), none showed progressive facial-nerve dysfunction or any signs of tumor. We conclude that an ipsilateral recurrence of facial paralysis without documented evidence of a tumor does not warrant a transmastoid decompression of the facial nerve. The results of our analysis were verified prospectively as well as retrospectively. A new classification system is introduced for ease of computer analysis and for simplified discussion of recurrent facial paralysis.\r"

Individual patients with resection of the vagal nerve above the origin of the superior laryngeal nerve were also studied. Open Quotient and Speed Quotient were calculated from the photoglottography signals. Speed Quotient values significantly differentiated recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis from idiopathic paralysis and superior laryngeal nerve paralysis, as well as from normal function. Data from patients with vagal resection clearly differentiated them from patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. The measure of Open Quotient distinguished pathological phonation from normal, but was not as useful for separation of differing lesions. Electroglottography appeared to be less useful than photoglottography. The pathophysiology underlying the observed glottographic signals is discussed.\r"

In two of these, subtotal petrosectomy with blind-sac closure of the external auditory canal was carried out via an anterior approach. The enclosed space was obliterated with pedicled temporalis muscle. Primary healing took place. One case was similarly obliterated using a prolonged posterior incision. The wound broke down, requiring a microvascular free flap for closure. Radiotherapy jeopardizes the viability of skin flaps. An anterior incision bases the flap behind on the occipital and postauricular arteries. When radiotherapy has been used, this incision has theoretical and practical advantages over a standard posterior incision.\r"

The changes induced to the cochlear action potentials by both methods were very similar. However, while using the territorial model for inducing hypoxia, 75% of the animals showed a threshold shift at a blood pO2 of 20 mm Hg and with the general model all the animals showed a threshold shift at 25 mm Hg blood pO2. In other words, if the hypoxic condition affected the whole body, other factors such as a slight, but continuous tendency to acidosis with significant increase in blood lactic acid concentration could join the oxygen deficit in affecting cochlear function.\r"

Five-year survival rates by N-stage, according to the TNM classification by UICC (1978), were 52% for N0 cases, 23% for N1, and 17% for N2-3 (N1 vs. N2-3, not significant). For N1-3 cases, corresponding figures by level of cervical nodal involvement by UICC (1978) were 29% for level 3 cases, 15% for level 2, and 8% for level 4 (level 3 vs. level 4, p less than 0.04). Therefore, the level of cervical nodal involvement was a more useful prognosticator for patients with nodal metastasis than the N-stage. Effective nodal control for patients with clinically positive nodes (N1-3) was obtained with a combination of neck node dissection and RT of 50 Gy or more. For N0 cases, elective RT of 50 Gy or more, encompassing an adequate field, was required.\r"

The technique has been termed \"evoked accelerometry\" (EAC) and is administered by a portable DC powered device. In performing a test, the device stimulates the facial nerve and then measures the evoked muscular response by a small accelerometer sensor affixed to the face with suction. The magnitude of the response is displayed as a digital readout on the device meter. The degree to which a reading is subnormal indicates the extent of nerve degeneration. In a study of normal participants the stimulus-response characteristics of the EAC technique were found to be similar to those of ENoG, indicating the clinical efficacy of the technique. However, evoked accelerometry was found to be more sensitive than ENoG (i.e., detectable response of 0.3% to 0.6% vs. 1.8% to 5.2%) and more accurate than ENoG (average error of 6.8% vs. 13.9% to 20.7%).\r"

Catecholamine catabolites in the urine were not increased, and blood pressure was always normal. The pituitary tumor was an adenoma, immunostaining positive for prolactin. The second patient, a 29-year-old hypertensive male, with a glomus jugulare tumor, had increased vanillylmandelic-acid excretion. In both cases, the paraganglioma tumor cells contained numerous dense-core vesicles (125 to 380 nm in diameter) in electron microscopy, and showed intense fluorescence by the sucrose-potassium phosphate-glyoxylic acid method. Using high-performance liquid chromatography and microspectrofluorometry we were able to establish the presence of large amounts of dopamine in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells.\r"

We compared the results with those in a control group of 100 patients. The prevalence of patent foramen ovale was significantly higher in the patients with stroke (40 percent) than in the control group (10 percent, P less than 0.001). Among the patients with stroke, the prevalence of patent foramen ovale was 21 percent in 19 patients with an identifiable cause of their stroke, 40 percent in 15 patients with no identifiable cause but a risk factor for stroke, such as mitral valve prolapse, migraine, or use of contraceptive agents, and 54 percent in 26 patients with no identifiable cause (P less than 0.10). These results suggest that because of the high prevalence of clinically latent venous thrombosis, paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale may be responsible for stroke more often than is usually suspected.\r"

The three liquid-formula diets, which were used in random order, were high in palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid, and oleic acid (18:1), respectively. Caloric intakes were the same during the three periods. As compared with the values observed when the subjects were on the high-palmitic-acid diet, plasma total cholesterol decreased by an average of 14 percent during consumption of the high-stearic-acid diet (P less than 0.005) and by 10 percent during consumption of the high-oleic-acid diet (P less than 0.02). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels fell by 21 percent in subjects on the high-stearic-acid diet (P less than 0.005) and by 15 percent in subjects on the high-oleic-acid diet (P less than 0.005). No significant differences were observed in the plasma levels of triglycerides or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol among the three diets. Measurements of the intestinal absorption of palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids revealed essentially complete absorption of each during the three dietary periods. The oleic acid content of plasma triglycerides and cholesteryl esters increased significantly during the high-stearic-acid period, suggesting that stearic acid is rapidly converted to oleic acid. We conclude that stearic acid appears to be as effective as oleic acid in lowering plasma cholesterol levels when either replaces palmitic acid in the diet.\r"

The rates at which autopsies detected major unexpected findings whose premortem diagnosis would probably have improved survival were 11 percent at the university hospital and 12 percent at the community hospital. Major unexpected findings whose premortem diagnosis would not have prolonged survival were found in another 12 and 21 percent of cases, respectively. Pulmonary embolism and fungal infections in immuno-compromised hosts were the most common major unexpected findings. Neither we nor the patients' physicians were able to identify from the clinical data the autopsies likely to have high yields. Furthermore, the physicians' estimates of an autopsy's expected yield were similar for patients evaluated by autopsy and for matched patients who were not. We conclude that the autopsy continues to yield clinically relevant findings at a high level and that it is not currently possible to predict which cases will have high yields. Autopsies are vital to ensure the quality of medical care, and autopsy rates must be increased substantially if this role is to be fully realized.\r"

During studies in humans, anagrelide in small doses has produced thrombocytopenia. We therefore evaluated it in the treatment of thrombocytosis, and to date, platelet levels in 15 of 17 patients with primary thrombocythemia, 2 patients with polycythemia vera and thrombocytosis, and 1 patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia and thrombocytosis have been well controlled with the use of this agent. Induction doses of 1.0 to 1.5 mg given orally every six hours have produced a decrease in the platelet count, starting on day 5 and reaching a normal level by day 12. Side effects of anagrelide have been minimal. Maintenance therapy with 1.5 to 4.0 mg a day has continued to control the platelet count in patients for up to 28 months. This new agent appears promising in the treatment of thrombocytosis in patients with chronic myeloproliferative disease.\r"

This analysis was undertaken as a background for a possible randomized clinical trial of prophylactic cranial irradiation in such patients. One hundred four patients (6.8 percent) had documented first recurrences involving the brain, including 98 patients (6.4 percent) in whom the brain was the sole site of first recurrence. Sixty patients (3.9 percent) had only intracranial involvement at the time of death. Prognostic variables that had a significant effect on the time to recurrence in the brain were histologic features of the carcinoma (patients with nonsquamous-cell cancers were more at risk than those with squamous-cell cancer), the T1N1/T2N0 and T2N1 staging subsets (T1, tumor less than or equal to 3 cm in diameter; T2, tumor greater than 3 cm; N0, no regional lymph-node metastasis; N1, ipsilateral hilar-lymph-node metastasis), and initial weight loss of more than 10 percent. We conclude that prophylactic cranial irradiation would at best benefit only a very small subset of these patients. We believe, therefore, that neither prophylactic cranial irradiation nor a randomized trial is indicated in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who have undergone complete resection.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral neuropathy plays an important part in the development of foot complications in patients with diabetes. We studied the contribution of impairment of the dual sensory and inflammatory function of unmyelinated nociceptive C fibers in the foot complications of diabetes. The integrity of these fibers was assessed objectively by measuring axon reflex vasodilation in response to stimulation with 10 percent acetylcholine introduced by electrophoresis. This was related to the non-neurogenic capacity of the vessels to dilate in response to a mechanical stroke. These measurements were made on the soles of the subjects' feet. The function of the nociceptive C fibers was abnormal in 1 of 14 patients with longstanding diabetes who had no foot complications, 3 of 9 patients with diabetes and skin sepsis, 8 of 11 patients with typical neuropathic plantar ulcers, and all of 8 patients with neuroarthropathy. In patients with longstanding diabetes but no foot complications, the mean ratio of neurogenic to non-neurogenic vasodilation was not significantly different from that in controls; however, it was significantly lower in the other three groups (P less than 0.01 for those with sepsis; P less than 0.001 for those with ulcer or arthropathy). Impairment of the neurogenic vasodilator response, or flare, correlated with the clinical diminution of pain sensation. This study suggests that the loss of both components of nociceptive C-fiber function--neurogenic inflammation and pain sensation--is an important factor in the development of foot complications in diabetes.\r"

In particular, the Gestaltists proposed the law of shared common fate, in which features tend to be perceived as moving together, that is, coherently. Recent psychophysical findings, such as the cooperativity of the motion system and motion capture, support this law. Computationally, coherence is a sensible assumption, because if two features are close then they probably belong to the same object and thus tend to move together. Moreover, the measurement of local motion may be inaccurate and so the integration of motion information over large areas may help to improve the performance. Present theories of visual motion, however, do not account fully for these coherent motion percepts. We propose here a theory that does account for these phenomena and also provides a solution to the aperture problem, where the local information in the image flow is insufficient to specify the motion uniquely.\r"

The critical role served by the tegument in immune evasion and parasite homeostasis suggests that a detailed knowledge of tegumental components would be helpful in the design of new drugs and the production of vaccines. We demonstrate here, by immunoelectron microscopy, that the cytoskeletal proteins actin and paramyosin are organized into major tegumental structures of Schistosoma mansoni. The surface spines are composed of paracrystalline arrays of actin filaments. Actin is also present in areas recovering from damage, implying an important role for this structural protein in tegumental repair. Paramyosin exists predominantly in the tegument in a non-filamentous form, the membrane-bounded elongate bodies. The localization of this protein to the tegument of the parasite is the likely basis for resistance to S. mansoni observed in mice immunized with paramyosin (refs 1, 2 and T. P. Flanigen et al., in preparation).\r"

A relatively high frequency of carriers (1/27) of a lethal, infantile form of the disease is found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, but it is not yet evident whether this has resulted from a founder effect and random genetic drift or from a selective advantage of heterozygotes. We have identified a single-base mutation in a cloned fragment of the HEXA gene from an Ashkenazi Jewish patient. This change, the substitution of a C for G in the first nucleotide of intron 12 is expected to result in defective splicing of the messenger RNA. A test for the mutant allele based on amplification of DNA by the 'polymerase chain rection and cleavage of a DdeI restriction site generated by the mutation revealed that this case and two other cases of the Ashkenazi, infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease are heterozygous for two different mutations. The occurrence of multiple mutant alleles warrants further examination of the selective advantage hypothesis.\r"

We studied the long term survival in 91 consecutive patients with malignant gliomas diagnosed by stereotactic biopsy: 64 had glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and 27 had anaplastic astrocytoma (AA). Sixty-four per cent of the GBMs and 33% of the AAs involved deep or midline cerebral structures. The treatment prescribed after biopsy, the tumor location, the histological findings, and the patient's age at presentation (for AAs) were statistically important factors determining patient survival. If adequate RT (tumor dose of 5000 to 6000 cGy) was not prescribed, the median survival was less than or equal to 11 weeks regardless of tumor histology or location. The median survival for patients with deep or midline tumors who completed RT was similar in AA (19.4 weeks) and GBM (27 weeks) cases. Histology was an important predictor of survival only for patients with adequately treated lobar tumors. The median survival in lobar GBM patients who completed RT was 46.9 weeks, and that in lobar AA patients who completed RT was 129 weeks. Cytoreductive surgery had no statistically significant effect on survival. Among the clinical factors examined, age of less than 40 years at presentation was associated with prolonged survival only in AA patients. Constellations of clinical features, tumor location, histological diagnosis, and treatment prescribed were related to survival time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-four female cynomolgous monkeys were randomized into three groups of 8: sham, clot, and clot + intrathecal nimodipine. All animals underwent a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) induction operative procedure after base line angiography. Nimodipine was administered postoperatively by subcutaneous injection of 1 ml/0.2 mg tid for 6 days through an Ommaya reservoir with the catheter placed in the subarachnoid basal cisterns. Angiography was performed on Day 7 post-SAH induction. Intrathecally applied nimodipine was not effective in the prevention of angiographic vasospasm. It also did not seem to decrease the degree of pathological change when compared to controls. One animal in the nimodipine group died 2 hours after an intrathecal injection secondary to a respiratory arrest. Transient sedation and hypoventilation were common. No adverse pathological effects were noted. Intrathecal nimodipine did not produce a significant dilation of vessels in moderate or severe spasm when assessed by angiography 2 hours after intrathecal injection. Only 1 animal in 8 showed diffuse dilation of vasospastic cerebral vessels after an intrathecal nimodipine injection. Three other animals in this group developed dilation only of the basilar artery, which was in mild spasm.\r"

Ten patients with classic ruptured lumbar discs confirmed by computed tomography chose to participate. They were aged 31 to 51, seven men and three women, in excellent general health. A microsurgical approach through a 25-mm skin incision was performed. The technique emphasized removal of sufficient medial facet to allow excision of the disc with minimal or no root retraction. Once awake in the recovery room, patients were transferred to a separate ambulatory step-down unit. They were discharged only after they had voided, ambulated, taken oral nourishment, and been examined by the surgeon. A visiting nurse checked the patient at home the evening of operation and the next day. All returned to their usual occupation between 3 and 14 days postoperatively. All were satisfied and would choose the outpatient program again. Our experience indicates that ambulatory lumbar microdiscectomy can be a safe, effective option for selected patients.\r"

  ".W": "An operative repair technique for crushed sciatic nerve in the rat was used to examine whether removal of the damaged tissue could be better achieved with a low wattage CO2 laser or a blade. This approach was compared to results in rats undergoing conventional end-to-end nerve anastomosis using a microsurgical approach. Crushed sciatic nerves were exposed bilaterally 24 hours after injury and treated as follows. A longitudinally split polyethylene catheter was placed under the nerve, which was fixed to the catheter with 9-0 stitches placed away from lesion area; the nerve was bathed in ice-cold polyvinyl alcohol/chlorpromazine (PVA/CPZ) solution. After the nerve was crushed, the lesioned tissue was removed using laser pulses or a thin blade. A collagen matrix was used to fill the gap, and the preparation was covered and allowed to recover for 6 weeks. End-to-end anastomosis was done following same parameters, but with omission of the nerve catheter, PVA/CPZ solution, and collagen matrix; these nerves were reunited using epineurial stitches. High performance liquid chromotography (HPLC) analysis of each group showed that the laser approach reduced the levels of norepinephrine distal to the lesion, least, suggesting better regeneration of proximal axonal growth. Morphological and neuroelectric findings, although suggestive, showed no significant differences between laser and blade repair, a finding that reinforces the idea that such endpoints are not as sensitive as chemical assays of tissue transmitter levels such as HPLC. Laser or blade repair using nerve-catheter fixation and collagen bridge matrix was superior to end-to-end nerve anastomosis when morphological, neuroelectric, and HPLC values were compared in this model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The recipient artery must be occluded for only 3 to 5 minutes to complete the anastomosis. The anastomosis site was studied with the scanning electron microscope at different times (1 hour to 3 months) after the operation in 20 rats. In every case, the anastomosis was widely patent and a gradual endothelialization of the anastomosis site was observed. After 7 to 10 days, the endothelialization was more or less complete and, during the following weeks, a further smoothing of the ridge protruding into the anastomosis was noted. As an addendum, the authors describe an improvement of this technique that was developed after the sapphire tip of the neodymium: YAG laser became available. Now the anastomosis is fully completed and the connection between the two vessels is made by the laser tip introduced via a side branch of the donor vessel. The recipient artery need not be occluded at all. The results are promising.\r"

  ".W": "Carotid artery shunts are used extensively during carotid artery surgery to maintain cerebral perfusion. Blood flow through such shunts may be compromised by thrombosis, incorrect placement, or inadvertent clamping of the shunt. Currently, however, no direct method exists to detect poor shunt flow that might precipitate cerebral ischemia. A carotid artery shunt system that continuously monitors blood flow rates has been developed. This system utilizes a Doppler crystal embedded in the wall of a silicone elastomer shunt. The crystal ranges through a \"liquid lens\" that enables it to be placed without violation of the shunt lumen. Because the crystal is at a fixed angle (45 degrees) to the axis of blood flow and the diameter of the lumen remains constant, a linear relationship should exist between flow rates and the Doppler velocity signal. This hypothesis was tested in vitro using a pulsatile pump and both a starch-water solution and whole blood. Doppler velocity meter readings were compared to timed volume collections over a wide range of flow rates. A direct linear relationship between the Doppler flowmeter and timed volume collections existed, and the system was accurate to within 4.7%. This device may be useful in laboratory studies of carotid shunt dynamics and in clinical practice for early detection of correctable shunt flow abnormalities that could lead to cerebral injury.\r"

  ".W": "Three hundred twenty-four patients with reversed vertebral artery blood flow were reviewed for cerebrovascular events. Neither the presence nor the type of vertebral artery steal (permanent, n = 204; intermediate, n = 120) determined neurologic symptoms, which rather were related to coincidental carotid obstructions or abnormal flow velocity patterns in the basilar artery. Most patients (n = 209; 64%) had no neurologic symptoms. Hemispheric events (n = 99; 31%) occurred most frequently in patients with additional carotid lesions and nonhemispheric events in a few patients (n = 16; 5%) often with bilateral vertebral steal. Intracranial Doppler studies from the vertebral and basilar arteries excluded spontaneous retrograde basilar artery perfusion in any of a subgroup of 50 patients examined in addition. Thus, blood flow reversal in extracranial arteries is a marker for atherosclerotic vascular disease in general, rather than an indicator of a patient's risk to develop cerebrovascular events from hemodynamic insufficiency in the territory affected. Surgical treatment is discouraged for most patients with this benign flow abnormality.\r"

  ".W": "Information on 1,343 hospitalized patients in the Cornell Neurology Database with final diagnoses of transient ischemic attacks (TIA), reversible ischemic neurologic deficits (RIND), or ischemic stroke was examined in order to determine the duration of ischemic deficits. Episodes resolved within the first 24 hours (classic definition of TIA) in 382 of the patients (28.4%) and between days 1 and 7 (consistent with RIND) in 34 (2.5%). In 191 of the 382 patients with traditionally-defined TIAs (50.0%), episodes lasted less than 30 minutes, and in another 37 (9.7%), from 30 to 60 minutes. Of 1,115 patients with deficits lasting at least 60 minutes, only 154 (13.8%) resolved within 24 hours and could thus be considered to have had a TIA. Resolution within the next hour occurred in only 39 of 1,152 patients (3.4%) with a deficit at 30 minutes, 21 of 1,115 patients (1.9%) with a deficit at 60 minutes, 19 of 1,113 patients (1.7%) with a deficit at 90 minutes, and 16 of 1,094 patients (1.5%) with a deficit at 120 minutes. The data suggest that as currently managed, patients with a deficit persisting at least 60 minutes have less than a 2% chance of resolving spontaneously during any subsequent 1-hour period. Rapid resolution after instituting a new treatment in relatively few additional patients would suggest a therapeutic effect, even in a nonrandomized trial.\r"

Within 1 hour, 50% of TIA cases had recovered, and 90% had recovered within 4 hours. Neurologic deficit graded by a score at onset was significantly less in TIA patients than in stroke patients. We concluded that persistence of symptoms beyond a few hours and to a lesser extent the severity of symptoms at onset or at admission give a reliable indication of the diagnosis.\r"

The condition can be inferred from clinical neurologic signs, but has not been visualized during life. Using midsagittal magnetic resonance images (MRIs), we compared vertical brainstem position on 50 images from normals and 21 images from 15 clinically stable patients with large supratentorial tumors. The length of Twining's line (T), the perpendicular distance from T to the pontomesencephalic junction (T-PMJ), and from T to the apex of the midbrain aqueduct (T-A) were measured. We also measured lateral shifts of the diencephalon and midbrain on axial images. T-PMJ decreased from 2.04 +/- 0.06 mm in normals to 0.94 +/- 0.2 mm in patients with large cerebral tumors (p less than 0.0001). Similarly, T-A decreased from 6.35 +/- 0.13 mm in normals to 4.83 +/- 0.35 mm in patients (p = 0.001). Lateral diencephalic-midbrain shifts often accompanied DTH but to an unpredictable degree. Either lateral or downward brainstem shift could occur alone and did not necessarily produce specific neurologic signs or an altered state of consciousness. Anatomic DTH occurs in life, it can be quantified with MRI, and in slowly developing cerebral mass lesions the process can precede the appearance of neurologic signs and symptoms that indicate lower-diencephalic or midbrain dysfunction.\r"

A fifth individual, who had a systemic deficiency of biopterin synthesis, shared the features of reduced biopterin in CSF, marked diurnal variation in the degree of dystonia, and clinical improvement in response to levodopa. Generalized dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation was therefore shared by the four patients in whom biopterin deficiency was limited to the CNS and the patient with systemic deficiency of biopterin.\r"

  ".W": "The fluctuating response to levodopa may result from progressive loss of striatal dopamine terminals and consequently increasingly impaired dopamine storage capacity. This hypothesis predicts that the acute response to levodopa would shorten with increasing disease severity. To test this, we compared the duration of improvement in tapping and walking speeds following discontinuation of 2-hour levodopa infusions in nine previously untreated (UT), seven stable (ST), and 17 fluctuating (FL) subjects. Mean Hoehn and Yahr disability in the morning prior to levodopa infusion was 2.8, 2.2, and 4.4 for UT, ST, and FL subjects. Six of nine UT, six of seven ST, and all FL subjects exhibited improvement with the infusions, which produced similar peak plasma levodopa levels in all groups. The duration of the response was similar in the ST and FL groups. The response in the UT group was heterogeneous; in three, the response was of similar length as compared with the ST and FL groups, but was longer in the other three UT subjects. The correlation between disease severity and response duration was poor. The ST and FL groups, while differing in disease severity, exhibited a similar duration of response to levodopa infusion. This does not support a reduced dopamine \"storage capacity\" as the sole explanation for the length of the short-duration response. Furthermore, motor fluctuations appear to be present from early in treatment, but only become noticeable when \"off\" disability becomes marked.\r"

With this treatment, 13 (43%) of the patients with seizures of partial onset and 2 (33%) with PG had more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. The antiepileptic effect appeared during the first month of therapy and continued throughout the 7-month study. The side effects were mild: tiredness, aggressiveness, and ataxia. Other antiepileptic drugs remained at baseline levels during GVG therapy. GVG did not alter EEG recordings. Our results suggest that GVG is effective for treatment of intractable epilepsy, especially the partial type, in mentally retarded patients. Longer follow-up is needed, however, to determine that the clinical effect is maintained and that no severe side effects appear.\r"

Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a prolongation of the CBZ half-life, elevation of the CBZ-epoxide/CBZ ratio, and emergence of CBZ-epoxide as a significant toxic metabolite. A treatment approach is proposed including repeated gastric lavage, detection of an insoluble tablet coagulum, electrolyte monitoring, avoidance of cathartics, and treatment of seizures with diazepam and phenytoin.\r"

The overall mortality rate was 2.27 per million population per year, approximately 80% higher than the corresponding rate for deaths in which Huntington's disease was listed as the underlying cause of death. Age-specific mortality rates peaked around age 60. Rates were similar for both sexes, and higher in whites than nonwhites. Age-adjusted rates were similar for United States whites and reported values from the Scandinavian countries. The leading causes of death were pneumonia and heart disease. Other common causes of death were nutritional deficiencies; mental disorders; cerebrovascular disorders; and accidents, poisonings, and violence. Suicide was rarely reported.\r"

Cardiac arrest, either inside (n = 25) or outside (n = 24) the hospital, was the cause of unconsciousness in all except one patient who had hyperglycemic, hyperosmolar coma. After out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the risk of never regaining consciousness or dying during hospitalization did not differ significantly between unconscious patients with (n = 24) and without (n = 69) alpha frequencies in their EEGs. A review of the literature supports our findings that alpha coma most commonly follows cardiac arrest and does not preclude the possibility of neurologic recovery. We conclude that alpha coma is a descriptive term and lacks prognostic significance in itself.\r"

In all patients, MEG localization estimates were in the same lobe as the epileptic focus determined by invasive methods and EEG. In two patients, it was possible to quantify precisely the accuracy of MEG localization by mapping a spike focus that was visually indistinguishable on MEG and cortical recordings. In both patients, MEG localization was approximately 12 mm from the center of the cortical spike focus on intracranial recordings. In eight patients, MEG showed tangential dipolar field patterns on the spontaneous record, but EEG did not. In one patient, a cortical epileptic discharge was detected only on MEG for some discharges and only on EEG for other discharges. The MEG did not detect deep spikes with present levels of environmental noise.\r"

Although the lifetime risk of AD-type dementia was similar among relatives of early-onset and late-onset AD probands, relatives of early-onset probands tended to have an earlier onset of dementia than did relatives of late-onset AD probands. This result raises the possibility that age at onset of dementia in AD may be genetically determined.\r"

From 40 individuals with peripheral neuropathy and HIV infection, we have identified 26 patients with this syndrome. All had constitutional symptoms when neuropathic symptoms developed; 20 had AIDS and six had AIDS-related complex. The most common complaint was pain on the soles. Paresthesias were frequent and usually involved the entire foot. Signs of peripheral neuropathy were present in all; the most frequent finding was absent or reduced ankle reflexes. Electrophysiologic studies revealed abnormal sensory and motor conduction, studies suggesting a dying-back axonopathy. Over time, the neuropathy progressed in all except one patient with ARC, who had spontaneous subjective improvement. Tricyclic antidepressants provided partial symptomatic relief. In three patients, the neuropathy did not change during azidothymidine treatment. Predominantly sensory neuropathy in HIV infection appears to be a distal axonal degeneration primarily involving sensory neurons. The mechanism is unknown, but the neuropathy is associated with the late manifestations of HIV infection.\r"

In an experimental animal model of PVR, intravitreal injection of homologous rabbit corneal fibroblasts caused tractional retinal detachments in 90% of eyes after 4 weeks. The addition of 1.6 mg of liposome-encapsulated 5-FU decreased the rate of detachment to 32%, compared with 55% for 1 mg of free 5-FU.

Still, glaucoma, cystoid macular edema, endophthalmitis, and astigmatism remain vision-threatening complications. We studied intraocular pressures (IOPs) following this surgery in 102 patients (124 eyes) over 6 years. Elevated IOP was noted in 32 eyes (25.8%), but only 14 (11.3%) needed long-term medical treatment. None, however, required laser iridectomy, trabeculoplasty, or trabeculectomy. Patients should be selected for secondary anterior chamber implantation only after more conservative measures have been exhausted.\r"

The study was carried out on 5 cancer patients with severe, intractable pain in the lower half of the body. Samples of CSF were collected at the level of the 10th thoracic vertebra at regular intervals for 15 h after administration. Morphine concentrations were determined by HPLC. The pharmacokinetic properties of the solutions (I and II) were quite different. Peak levels (I) were reached in 5-15 min (30 and 60 micrograms/ml); they then fell rapidly during the 1st hour (7 and 11 micrograms/ml) with an elimination half-life of 10 and 15 min, followed by a change in slope (elimination half-life of 108 and 140 min). Peak levels (II) were reached in 4-5 h (0.8-3.3 micrograms/ml); they then fell progressively according to a single exponential function (elimination half-life: 144-246 min). The duration of analgesia for a dose of 2 mg was 30 h for solution 2 and 24 h for solution 1. The hyperbaric solution, which produced the same degree of analgesia as the isobaric solution, limited the cephalad diffusion of morphine and reduced or abolished the central depressant effects of the drug.\r"

  ".W": "Antibody responses to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) were serially investigated by the complement-fixation test in 72 Japanese of both sexes, suffering from herpes zoster (HZ), but otherwise healthy. Our objective was to elucidate whether there were mutual relationships among severities of skin lesion, maximum antibody titers to VZV, and duration of treatment for acute herpetic pain (AHP). Patients were divided into 3 groups: mild group (n = 26), moderate group (n = 26) and severe group (n = 20), according to the severity of the skin lesions. The 3 groups did not differ significantly with respect to age (P greater than 0.6). All patients were treated with regional sympathetic nerve blocks (SNBs) until pain relief was achieved. The durations of treatment for AHP became significantly longer as HZ increased in severity; the mean log10 durations of treatment (+/- S.E.) for the mild, moderate, and severe groups were 1.383 +/- 0.037, 1.616 +/- 0.055, and 1.888 +/- 0.069 days, respectively (P less than 0.01 for the mild group vs. the moderate group, and P less than 0.001 for the moderate group vs. the severe group). Irrespective of age, the maximum antibody titers closely paralleled the severities of the skin lesion of HZ; the mean maximum log2 antibody titers (+/- S.E.) for the mild, moderate, and severe groups were 5.12 +/- 0.24, 6.73 +/- 0.20, and 8.00 +/- 0.18, respectively (P less than 0.001 for the mild group vs. the moderate group and for the moderate group vs. the severe group).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pain threshold, i.e., the initial awareness of pain, was not modified by either morphine or alcohol. The experiment was run using 18 paid subjects in an experimenter-blinded design. Both a pharmacologically active placebo (atropine) as well as a totally inactive placebo (saline) were employed. Pain induction occurred via mechanical pressure on the Achilles tendon utilizing a device previously standardized in the clinical screening of over 100,000 patients for pain awareness. These results suggest that alcohol, in non-intoxicating quantities, may be an effective adjunct to other analgesic modalities.\r"

The prevalence of pain in the prior six months was 41% for back pain; 26% for headache; 17% for abdominal pain; 12% for chest pain; and 12% for facial pain. Headache, abdominal and facial pain were less prevalent among older persons and more prevalent among females. We examined the temporal dimensions of these pain conditions, as well as intensity, treatment seeking, and activity limitation. The pain conditions were typically long standing, recurrent, of mild to moderate intensity, and usually did not limit activities. However, depending on the pain condition, 9-40% reported one or more days in the prior six months when they were unable to carry out their usual activities due to the pain problem. On average, persons with a pain condition had higher levels of anxiety, depression, and non-pain somatic symptoms as measured by the scales of the Symptom Checklist (SCL); poorer self-rating of health status; and more family stress compared to persons without a pain condition. Of these alternative measures of distress, the SCL somatization scale had the strongest independent association with pain. The increments in measures of anxiety, depression, and family stress with the presence of pain were greatest among persons with higher levels of non-pain somatic symptoms.\r"

The distribution of mental illnesses was not related to the organic status and those without physical disease had the lowest ratings on psychiatric assessments. All major findings were confirmed at a follow-up assessment. There is no evidence that these subjects can be divided into a simple dichotomy of those with physical or mental illnesses, or that pain measures can discriminate between them.

Chronic pain patients evidenced lower scores on all Harris and Lingoes Sc subscales, except for the Bizarre Sensory Experiences subscale on which they scored significantly higher than the psychiatric groups. Results demonstrate that Sc is elevated in many chronic pain patients because they endorse somatic symptoms and items suggestive of depression and inertia, whereas psychotics endorse more items reflecting bizarre and disordered thinking, social alienation and defective inhibition, and non-psychiatric patients endorse more depression, despair, thought disorganization and social alienation. These data suggest that high Sc scores of many chronic pain patients reflect symptoms and sequelae of their physical problems, and do not necessarily reflect severe psychopathology.\r"

An exposure for 30 min to a 0.5 Hz rotating magnetic field (1.5-90 gauss) reduced both the warm and cold stress-induced analgesia, with the magnetic stimuli having significantly greater inhibitory effects at night and on the opioid-induced responses.

The effects of various ionic and non-ionic solutions were tested in both deep and shallow dentinal cavities. With saline in the deep dentinal cavity a very low firing rate or resting nerve spike (action potentials) activity was recorded. When 3 M NaCl was placed in the same or similar cavity a high discharge rate of nerve spike activity was obtained. This 3 M NaCl elicited activity was utilized to determine the inhibitory or excitatory effects of various test agents on the intradental nerves. The following agents: MgCl2, MgSO4, and CaCl2 were inhibitory to the INA response elicited by 3 M NaCl. Non-ionic solutions of urea or sucrose failed to evoke INA and they were also minimally effective in altering 3 M NaCl elicited activity. Shallow cavities were utilized to maintain the tubular structure of dentin relatively intact. In the shallow cavity preparations hypertonic sucrose or urea failed to evoke INA, even when dentin was etched with 50% citric acid for 2 min. The results suggest that the osmolarity of these solutions is a poor indicator of the INA.\r"

From these sources, a list of Arabic pain adjectives was compiled. 67 university undergraduates classified each word as sensory, evaluative or affective, and rated the pain intensity connoted. Over 100 Arabic pain words were identified. Ratings revealed that, just as in English, pain is a multidimensional concept. The pain intensity rank ordering of many groupings in the MPQ was preserved when the Arabic translations were rated, even though the Arabic adjectives were not presented in the format of the MPQ. Theoretical and practical problems encountered in producing a fully equivalent pain inventory in another language are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "This study presents a German version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) developed by strict adherence to the methodology originally employed by Melzack and Torgerson. Three groups of subjects participated: The first group (n = 40) was used to construct a 5-point intensity scale. The second group (n = 42) was presented a preliminary translation of the MPQ and asked to assign an intensity rating out of the 5-point intensity scale to each of the 78 adjectives. In the last phase, adjectives whose mean ratings differed markedly from those in the original MPQ were resubmitted, along with 3-4 synonyms to a third group (n = 40) who was again asked to assign an intensity value to each word. Finally, the adjectives whose ratings corresponded closest, and thus resulted in congruent rank positions to those of the English originals, were selected. The present counterpart to the MPQ retains the original grouping of adjectives, the identical number of words per group as well as their rank positions within groups. Thus a comparison between German and English mean ratings, rank values and number of words chosen as well as statistical calculations derived therefrom is feasible.\r"

In experiment I, correlations between yoked actometers during ambulation showed the instrument to be internally reliable. In experiment II, actometer readings covaried very strongly with distance, showing the device to be valid during single trial assessment. However, experiment III found the device to show poor reliability over time (i.e., substantial measurement variability for the identical distance on 3 separate days). The results suggest that, for the chronic pain population, the actometer may not be a useful instrument for reliably assessing changes in walking activity over time.\r"

Antinociception was assessed using the tail-flick test. Tail-flick latencies following subcutaneous morphine plus intrathecal vehicle, or subcutaneous saline plus intrathecal clonidine were not significantly different from baseline. However, the combination of subcutaneous morphine plus intrathecal clonidine produced a significant antinociceptive effect. Such potentiation may prove to be a useful clinical strategy to help maximize analgesia, minimize side effects and attenuate the development of tolerance.\r"

Responses to heat stimuli ranging from 41 to 49 degrees C were compared before and after injury. In 11 CMHs, the injury was applied 4 mm peripheral to the edge of the receptive field. The response to the heat sequence was not significantly altered by this adjacent injury. In 16 CMHs, a cut was applied directly to the receptive field. This direct injury led to a significant increase in response to the sequence of heat stimuli (i.e., sensitization). It is concluded that spreading sensitization of C-fiber nociceptors to a cut injury does not occur in monkey.\r"

A single dose of the serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibitors produced antinociception in the hot-plate test but not in the tail-flick test. After chronic administration, reduced tail-flick latencies were demonstrated 24, 48, 72 and 144 h after withdrawal of zimelidine treatment, 48 h after withdrawal of alaproclate and 48 and 96 h after withdrawal of chlorimipramine treatment. The hot-plate response temperatures were slightly lowered after chronic zimelidine treatment but not after treatment with alaproclate or chlorimipramine. The response to 5-MeODMT was not altered by a single dose of the 5-HT uptake inhibitors, however, after withdrawal of chronic treatment this response was increased in the tail-flick test but not in the hot-plate test. It was concluded that acute and chronic treatment with 5-HT uptake inhibitors modulate nociception differently, and that chronic treatment induces supersensitivity of spinal postsynaptic 5-HT receptors. Different modulation of different 5-HT receptor subpopulations by these compounds may possibly contribute to the test-dependent results.\r"

The results of the individual subjects were reproduced in a later session: the rats showing increased TFL on day 1, responded with increased TFL on day 2. Rats showing decreased TFL on day 1 responded with decreased TFL on day 2. Whichever reaction occurred, analgesia or hyperalgesia, this correlated with the animal's behavior during the stress procedure. Analgesia was produced in quiet rats and hyperalgesia in hyperemotional ones. Various peripheral nerve stimulation procedures producing hyperemotional reactions also resulted in lowering of the pain threshold. The results of the present study show behavioral modulation of pain mechanisms.\r"

Stress-induced hyperalgesia was abolished by the administration of diazepam (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) and clonidine (25 micrograms/kg i.p.). It is suggested that the reversal of hyperalgesia was due to the anxiolytic properties of the drugs. Yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist (5 mg/kg i.p.), antagonized the effect of clonidine. The influence of clonidine on stress-induced hyperalgesia may be mediated by alpha 2-adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".W": "Several authors claim that analgesia by low-frequency peripheral nerve stimulation (transcutaneously or through inserted needles) depends on the activation of small-diameter A delta afferents. In the present study, a marked increase in pain threshold assessed by the squeak threshold test (vocalization to electric shocks delivered to the tail) was obtained by 2 Hz sciatic or radial nerve low-intensity stimulation, using single pulses. Conduction velocities of the activated nerve fibers ranged between 33.6 and 46.4 m/sec, which is consistent with activation of large afferent A fibers. This analgesic effect was reversed by naloxone (3 mg/kg i.v.). Thus, low-threshold afferents may contribute to the analgesic effect in addition to the previously reported high-threshold induced effect. High-intensity stimulation (5-6 times the threshold for visible muscular twitches), activating small-diameter afferents (A delta fibers) resulted in a decrease in pain threshold. Hyperalgesia also resulted from low-intensity stimulation using trains of pulses. The analgesic or hyperalgesic effects were correlated with the animal's behavior during stimulation. Analgesia was obtained in calm rats, who went to sleep regularly. When the rats showed signs of being distressed, hyperalgesia resulted. These findings may explain the occasional failure to obtain reduction in pain in anxious human patients by peripheral stimulation.\r"

The present results indicate that repeated injections of 10 ng of SP, administered at 60 sec intervals, result in the rapid development of tachyphylaxis to this SP-induced behavioral phenomenon. Three injections of SP produced a greatly attenuated behavioral response compared to that of a single injection of SP. Mice injected with Freund's adjuvant in the hind foot pads to produce an arthritic-like condition exhibited significantly less desensitization to SP after repeated i.t. injection compared to that in saline-injected control mice. While large doses of naloxone (5 mg/kg s.c. or 1 microgram i.t.) combined with each injection of SP completely blocked the desensitization to the effect of SP in naive mice, a smaller dose of naloxone (0.5 mg/kg administered s.c.) failed to alter the apparent tachyphylaxis to SP similar to that seen in saline-treated control mice. Pretreatment with 0.5 micrograms i.t. of beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA) also failed to alter the degree of apparent tachyphylaxis to SP. Co-administration of 1 microgram of fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or 1 microgram of phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, completely blocked the development of tachyphylaxis to i.t. SP. These results indicate that tachyphylaxis to SP appears to involve activation of the endogenous opioid system. Desensitization also appears to involve activation and inhibition of the descending adrenergic and serotonergic systems respectively.\r"

Most of their cell bodies were smaller than 1000 microns2 in cross-sectional area and the histogram of each showed a unimodal pattern. The modes of percentage distribution were 100-200 microns2 (34.4%), 500-600 microns2 (17.4%) and 300-400 microns2 (35.1%) for the mylohyoid nerve, the tooth pulp and the cornea, respectively. A comparison of the 3 histograms indicated that there were at least 3 subpopulations of trigeminal primary neurons, i.e., small, medium, and large cells. Electron microscopically, the large primary neurons innervating the tooth pulp had endoplasmic reticulum throughout the cytoplasm. The small primary neurons innervating the cornea showed a clear zonation of organelles and the endoplasmic reticulum was located in the periphery of the cytoplasm. The light microscopically identified small, medium and large cell groups may correspond to C-, A delta- and A beta-fibers. The tooth pulp and the cornea appear to receive mainly A beta-fibers and A delta-fibers, respectively. The cutaneous branch of the mylohyoid nerve appears to contain numerous C-fibers and progressively smaller proportions of A delta- and A beta-fibers.\r"

Data included date of injury, demography (for both suicides and suicide attempts), and recorded personal and social history (available for attempts only). There were 11 deaths due to suicide (definite or possible) in the five years reviewed: seven male, 10 aged 15 to 19 years. The mean annual rate for suicide deaths (definite and possible, based on ICD codes) was 10.3 per 100,000 15 to 19 year olds, with male rates exceeding female rates. Male rates were lower in the study area than in Chicago, Illinois or the United States, but female rates were higher. Suicides represented an unusually high proportion of all adolescent deaths. Atypically, there were no firearm suicide deaths. Two hundred ten suicide attempts were studied: 77% aged 15 to 19 years, 70% female, and 82% white; 83% involved ingestion of medications or poisons. The mean annual suicide attempt rate was approximately 140 per 100,000 for 15 to 19 year olds, and 45 per 100,000 for 10 to 14 year olds, with female rates exceeding male rates. There was an association between suicide attempt dates and occurrence of holidays, and there was a peak in attempts at the end of the school year. Detailed analysis of personal and social attributes associated with suicide attempts was prevented by poor recording of relevant factors in the medical record.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In disaster planning, the role of the specialist is often overlooked. That role, for the pediatrician, entails being familiar with hospital and community disaster plans and agreeing to take part in implementation of those plans by: (1) before a disaster, teaching special pediatric emergency techniques to emergency medical technicians and paramedics, being sure that pediatric supplies and equipment are available in ambulances, checking to see that pediatric needs have been considered in designated evacuation shelters, and, for disasters occurring in one's own hospital, being sure that evacuation routes are known and that means of notifying parents have been set up; (2) during a disaster, helping to determine which pediatric patients can be discharged from the hospital or transferred to another hospital if beds are needed for accident victims, and being available as needed according to the plans; and (3) after a disaster, counseling parents and children on how to cope with the stress and fear of having been involved in a disaster. The emergency pediatrician active in disaster planning has a responsibility to see that the services of pediatricians in general practice are incorporated into those plans.\r"

  ".W": "This study was conducted to demonstrate that experienced pediatricians using standard clinical indications for performing a lumbar puncture should have a higher yield of positive spinal taps than previously reported and also can detect bacterial meningitis. These indicators included temperature elevation, inability to be consoled, level of alertness, nuchal rigidity, bulging fontanel, decreased appetite, rash, referral, and febrile seizures. Eighty-two of 381 (22%) lumbar punctures were positive for pleocytosis and/or organisms. Patients were divided into two groups, consisting of those with one indicator (low risk) and those with greater than one indicator (high risk). Thirteen of 14 patients with bacterial meningitis were placed in the high risk group. The single patient in the low risk group had been pretreated with antibiotics. The positive predictive value in bacterial meningitis for a score greater than one was 5%. The average number of clinical indicators in bacterial meningitis was 3.7, versus 2.4 in viral meningitis and 1.6 without meningitis. These findings suggest that, in the absence of prior antibiotic therapy, an experienced pediatrician can clinically detect patients at high risk for bacterial meningitis. Nonbacterial meningitis cannot be as readily detected clinically.\r"

A discrete-state, continuous-time random walk with one or more absorption states can be studied by a presumably new method: some mean properties, including the mean time to absorption, can be found from a modified diagram (graph) in which each absorption state is replaced by a one-way cycle back to the starting state. The second problem is a random walk on a diagram (graph) with cycles. The walk terminates on completion of the first cycle. This walk can be replaced by an equivalent walk on a modified diagram with absorption. This absorption diagram can in turn be replaced by another modified diagram with one-way cycles back to the starting state, just as in the first problem. The third problem, important in biophysics, relates to a long-time continuous walk on a diagram with cycles. This diagram can be transformed (in two steps) to a modified, more-detailed, diagram with one-way cycles only. Thus, the one-way cycle fluxes of the original diagram can be found from the state probabilities of the modified diagram. These probabilities can themselves be obtained by simple matrix inversion (the probabilities are determined by linear algebraic steady-state equations). Thus, a simple method is now available to find one-way cycle fluxes exactly (previously Monte Carlo simulation was required to find these fluxes, with attendant fluctuations, for diagrams of any complexity). An incidental benefit of the above procedure is that it provides a simple proof of the one-way cycle flux relation Jn +/- = IIn +/- sigma n/sigma, where n is any cycle of the original diagram.\r"

The optically active cation (+)-phenylethylammonium was used as the chiral reference. The structure of [C6H5CH3CHNH3]+[HOOCCH2CHDCOO]- has been studied with x-ray diffraction at room temperature and neutron diffraction at 100 K. Crystal data from the neutron diffraction analysis of the phenylethylammonium salt of the title compound at 100 K: space group P21; a = 8.407(2) A, b = 8.300(4) A, c = 8.614(2) A, beta = 91.20(3) degrees; unit cell volume = 600.9(3) A3, zeta = 2 (numbers in parentheses are the estimated standard deviations). Final agreement factors are R(F2) = 0.0355 and R(wF2) = 0.0457 for 1690 independent neutron reflections and 297 parameters varied. The result confirms the stereochemistry of the malate/succinate transformation, as well as the NAD+/NADH interconversion, and demonstrates the usefulness of the single-crystal neutron diffraction method for determining the absolute configuration of molecules having a chiral monodeuteriomethylene group.\r"

The binding sites for eight anti-MIR mAbs and for eight anti-alpha-subunit, non-anti-MIR mAbs were localized. Anti-MIR mAbs bound to one peptide corresponding to residues 63-80 of the human alpha subunit. A second panel of peptides corresponding to the various parts of the alpha-subunit segment 63-80 was synthesized. Anti-MIR antibodies bound to a peptide that contained the alpha-subunit sequence 67-76. Thus, a main constituent loop of the MIR is localized between residues 67 and 76 of the alpha subunit.\r"

  ".W": "Synthetic mRNA precursors from the Drosophila fushi tarazu (ftz) gene were shown to be accurately and efficiently spliced in Drosophila nuclear extracts derived from Kc tissue culture cells or 0- to 12-hr embryos. Splicing the ftz pre-mRNA requires ATP and low levels of Mg2+. The reaction proceeds with a lag of 20-30 min prior to appearance of spliced mRNA and appears to proceed in two steps. The first step is cleavage at the 5' splice site to generate a 5' exon (E1) fragment and an intron-3' exon (IVS-E2) species. The second step involves cleavage at the 3' splice site, ligation of the two exons (E1-E2), and intron (IVS) release. The excised intron (IVS) and intron-3' exon (IVS-E2) exhibit anomalous electrophoretic mobility, suggesting that they contain branched structures. Nuclease analysis using two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography indicates that both the IVS and IVS-E2 species possess branched trinucleotides in which a guanosine residue at the 5' end of the intron is linked in a 2'-5' phosphodiester bond to the 2' hydroxyl group of an adenosine residue in the intron. The site of branchpoint formation was localized by debranching the Drosophila lariat with mammalian (HeLa) cell debranching enzyme and by P1 and T2 nuclease analysis. These findings indicate that nuclear extracts derived from Drosophila cultured cells or embryos can accurately splice mRNA precursors and that the reaction mechanism is the same as has been observed in yeast and mammalian cells. This system provides an initial step toward the biochemical analysis of developmentally regulated pre-mRNA splicing events in Drosophila.\r"

The available data also show (i) that exons are fairly limited in size but are large enough to specify structure-function modules in proteins; (ii) that the position of introns for homologous domains in the same gene is reasonably stable, but there is also evidence for mechanisms that alter the position or existence of introns; and (iii) that it is possible that the observed relationship of exons to protein structure represents a degenerate state of an ancestral correspondence between exons and structure-function modules in proteins.\r"

  ".U": "88203618\r", 
  ".W": "We have isolated and characterized a fragment of the gene encoding adipose fatty acid-binding protein (gene 422) from a 3T3-L1 adipocyte genomic library. The 5'-flanking sequence of the 422 gene contains potential regulatory regions for adipose-specific expression. At position -120 there is a fat-specific element that occurs in several genes expressed as preadipocytes differentiate, and at position -393 there is a glucocorticoid regulatory element core sequence. Chimeric constructs were prepared by ligating 858 base pairs or 248 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequence and 22 nucleotides of 5'-untranslated sequence of the 422 gene to the bacterial gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT); these constructs (delta 858.CAT and delta 248.CAT) were transfected into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. When differentiation was initiated by the adipogenic agents methylisobutylxanthine (a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor), dexamethasone, and insulin, expression of both constructs increased, reaching maximal levels within 24 hr. Both constructs were maximally induced 48 hr before appreciable accumulation of the endogenous 422 mRNA. Expression of delta 858.CAT, but not of delta 248.CAT, was induced by dexamethasone, which correlates with deletion of the potential glucocorticoid regulatory element. Expression of both constructs was induced by 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, thus implicating the first 248 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequence of the 422 gene in the response to cAMP. Indirect effects by the adipogenic factors on CAT protein or mRNA synthesis and turnover were ruled out, since replacing the 5'-flanking region of the 422 gene constructs with viral promoters abolished the effects of dexamethasone and 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate on CAT expression. We conclude that the first 858 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequence of the 422 gene contains elements that mediate activation by dexamethasone and cAMP.\r"

The products of these in vitro-generated TRK oncogenes retain the parental tyrosine protein kinase activity and contain an intact carboxyl terminus. However, they exhibit distinct biochemical properties. Whereas some of them are nonglycosylated cytoplasmic molecules, others were found to be transmembrane glycoproteins. These results suggest that TRK oncogenes may induce malignant transformation by allowing their tyrosine kinase to interact with various substrates depending on the nature of their activating sequences. If so, the TRK kinase may serve as a pleiotropic marker to identify various cellular proteins whose unscheduled phosphorylation on tyrosine residues contributes to neoplastic transformation.\r"

Transverse-tubule membranes were prepared in high yield by Ribi-press treatment. The DHP-receptor complex was solubilized in 1% digitonin followed by a two-step chromatographic purification procedure. The equilibrium dissociation constant of [3H](+)-PN200-110 binding (Kd; 0.9 nM) was not significantly changed by solubilization or purification. The purified DHP-receptor is composed of two subunits with apparent molecular masses of 148 kDa and 195 kDa migrating in polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions as a single moiety of approximately 300 kDa. The 195-kDa subunit was affinity-labeled with [3H]azidopine in both transverse-tubule membranes and purified DHP-receptor preparations. The subunit can be degraded by high-energy irradiation to a 26-kDa peptide and by proteolysis to a 32-kDa peptide. Thus, it is probably due to proteolytic cleavage and/or photolysis that neither purification nor affinity-labeling studies have previously identified a DHP-receptor subunit of comparable molecular mass (195 kDa).\r"

  ".U": "88203623\r", 
  ".W": "Synexin, a cytosolic protein that mediates Ca2+-dependent membrane fusion, was incorporated into acidic phospholipid bilayers, formed at the tip of a patch pipet. The pipet was filled with a high-Ca2+ solution (50 mM) and immersed in a chamber containing a low-Ca2+ solution (1 mM). Brief exposures of the bilayer to synexin increased the capacitance of the bilayer by a factor of 10 and decreased the membrane resistance by a factor of 20. Reduction of Ca2+ in the chamber to 1 microM caused an abrupt increase in the current required to hold the pipet potential at 0 mV. Under certain conditions channel events could be detected, often occurring in bursts. Consistently, open-time histograms were found to be voltage-dependent and to exhibit one time constant in the time range examined here. The slope conductance for the synexin channel was estimated as 10.2 +/- 2.1 pS for the large Ca2+ gradient with low chamber Ca2+. However, for symmetrical, low-Cl- solutions containing 25 mM Ca2+ the conductance was 26.5 +/- 5.2 pS. Ion-replacement studies showed the synexin channel to much prefer Ca2+ over Ba2+ or Mg2+. Cd2+, a potent blocker of other voltage-gated Ca2+ channels at 100 microM, blocked synexin channels only at very high concentrations (greater than or equal to 10 mM). Similarly, nifedipine, an inhibitor of the nonactivating Ca2+ channel, was effective only at extremely high concentrations (greater than 300 microM). The high selectivity for Ca2+ and the lack of response of the channel to various drugs known to block Ca2+ channels thus distinguish the synexin channel from other types of Ca2+ channels hitherto reported.\r"

Patterns of breast cancer occurrence in families were investigated by complex segregation analysis. In a sample of 1579 nuclear families ascertained through a population-based series of probands, an autosomal dominant model with a highly penetrant susceptibility allele fully explained disease clustering. From the maximum-likelihood Mendelian model, the frequency of the susceptibility allele was 0.0006 in the general population, and lifetime risk of breast cancer was 0.82 among susceptible women and 0.08 among women without the susceptibility allele. Inherited susceptibility affected only 4% of families in the sample: multiple cases of this relatively common disease occurred in other families by chance. The same genetic models, with higher gene frequency, explained disease clustering in an extended kindred at high risk of breast cancer. Evidence for a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant susceptibility allele for breast cancer in a high-risk family and the general population suggests that high-risk families can serve as models for understanding breast cancer in the population as a whole.\r"

The studies reported here show that in fetal stages constitutive expression of the relevant genes on the level of steady-state mRNA is identical in the livers of homozygous deletion mutants and normal littermates. Furthermore, prenatally these enzymes are expressed also in cell types other than hepatocytes. Thus, the putative trans-acting regulatory factors encoded in the deleted region of chromosome 7 of the mouse appear to be concerned specifically with the regulation of cell type-specific inducible expression of various hepatocyte-specific genes, whereas constitutive expression of the same genes is not affected.\r"

  ".W": "A population formed by genetic admixture of two or more source populations may exhibit considerable linkage disequilibrium between genetic loci. In the presence of recombination, this linkage disequilibrium declines with time, a fact that is often ignored when considering haplotypes of closely linked systems [e.g., Gm serum group (gamma globulins), HLA, and, more recently, restriction fragment length polymorphisms]. Recombination alters haplotype frequencies over time, and the haplotype-derived measures of admixture proportions from haplotype frequencies in generations following the admixture event become progressively more biased. The direction and extent of this bias can be predicted only when the history of admixture is known. Numerical illustration suggests that this bias is problematic whenever rt greater than 0.05, where r is the recombination rate between linked loci and t is the time (in generations) that has elapsed since the admixture event. In general, even the haplotype frequencies defined by multiple restriction fragment length polymorphism should be used with caution for admixture analysis. When recombination rates or the time since admixture are not precisely known, it is advantageous to consider each restriction fragment length polymorphism site separately for admixture analysis.\r"

This antibody blocks aggregation of cell lines mediated by the ICAM-1 molecule and is here shown to block homotypic binding of purified populations of activated T and B lymphocytes (blasts) and also aggregation of mixed T- and B-cell blasts. We also demonstrate that W-CAM-1 inhibited T-cell adhesion to normal human endothelial cells, the first step in lymphocyte egress into the tissues. In tests of immune function, W-CAM-1 had a modest inhibitory effect on T- and B-cell activation by potent mitogens and no effect on the response of activated lymphocytes to lymphokines. By contrast, activation induced by cell-cell contact (mixed lymphocyte reaction, T-cell-mediated B-cell activation) was significantly inhibited. Moreover, the antibody was shown to block elements of both effector arms of the immune system (cytotoxic cell function and immunoglobulin production). These findings show that the ICAM-1 molecule is a central component of the mechanism of lymphocyte-endothelial cell adhesion. The studies of lymphoid function demonstrate a pivotal role for this molecule in both the T-cell/T-cell and T-cell/B-cell interactions, which underpin the regulation of the immune response, and in the mechanism of cell-mediated cytotoxicity.\r"

Utilizing gene transfection, we have identified a second Qa-2 subregion class I gene (Q9), in H-2b mice, which encodes a polypeptide biochemically similar to the Q7 and the Qa-2 polypeptides. Furthermore, we have observed that cell lines transfected with the allelic forms of the Q7 gene from C57BL/10 (Qa-2hi) or BALB/C (Qa-2low) display quantitative differences in cell-surface expression. Based on these studies, we suggest that gene dosage and allele-specific variation in cell-surface expression contribute to the strain-specific variation in the levels of Qa-2 antigen expression.\r"

Encapsulated FdUMP (up to 9 mumol/ml of packed erythrocytes) did not affect erythrocyte metabolism or morphology. Hemolysates were found to catalyze efficient dephosphorylation of FdUMP to yield nearly stoichiometric amounts of the corresponding deoxyribonucleoside 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd), an antineoplastic drug showing selective cytotoxicity toward liver metastases from colorectal carcinomas. The dephosphorylation reaction had an apparent Km of 7.7 +/- 1.2 mM FdUMP at pH 7.4 and was remarkably slower at pH 8.2. ATP, GTP, and UTP inhibited both the disappearance of FdUMP and the formation of FdUrd in hemolysates. The enzyme responsible for the FdUMP-to-FdUrd conversion was identified with the deoxyribonucleotide-specific isozyme of erythrocyte pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5). Intracellular formation and subsequent release of FdUrd were observed in intact erythrocytes loaded with FdUMP. Inhibition of FdUrd release from these erythrocytes was obtained by raising the pH intracellularly and, alternatively, by coencapsulation of ATP. Autologous FdUMP-loaded erythrocytes might be used as endogenous bioreactors designed for time-programmed and liver-targeted delivery of FdUrd.\r"

For this purpose a duodenal provocation test was developed by use of a pediatric gastroscope, allowing the evaluation of the influence of antagonists on the intestinal disorder upon SEB challenge at the same duodenal site. First, carboxymethylation of histidine residues of SEB caused a complete loss of emetic and skin-sensitizing activity without changing the immunological specificity. However, carboxymethylated SEB is a strong inhibitor of enteric intoxications and immediate-type skin reactions upon SEB challenge. Second, after immunization of BALB/c mice with monoclonal anti-SEB antibodies, monoclonal antiidiotypic antibodies (anti-Id) were obtained by the \"hybridoma technique\" and purification by idiotype-affinity chromatography. Anti-Id specifically inhibited the binding of horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-SEB to the ligand, and SEB blocked as well the interaction of these two antibody species, indicating a high degree of binding-site selectivity. Anti-Id completely protected against emetic response and diarrhea upon duodenal provocation with SEB and inhibited immediate-type skin reactions as well. Further, anti-Id acted as an antagonist without triggering biologic functions themselves. This shows that anti-Id constitute a useful tool to protect against a bacterial toxin-induced intestinal disorder.\r"

All of these compounds showing peroxyl radical-trapping activity were also electrochemically active as reducing agents in cyclic voltammetric measurements. Furthermore, carnosine inhibited the oxidative hydroxylation of deoxyguanosine induced by ascorbic acid and copper ions. Other roles of carnosine, such as chelation of metal ions, quenching of singlet oxygen, and binding of hydroperoxides, are also discussed.

  ".W": "Since the antithrombin action of heparin fails to interrupt arterial thrombosis, a mediating role for thrombin (EC 3.4.21.5) in the formation of high-shear platelet-dependent thrombus has been unproven. To determine whether thrombin is important in acute arterial thrombus formation and to assess the therapeutic potential of inhibiting its action, the effects of the synthetic covalent antithrombin D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (FPRCH2Cl) on arterial-flow vascular graft thrombosis and occlusion have been studied in a nonhuman primate model. Continuous intravenous infusion of FPRCH2Cl (100 nmol/kg per min) into vascular graft-bearing baboons (Papio anubis) abolished (i) vascular graft 111In-platelet deposition, (ii) vascular graft occlusion, (iii) thrombus-associated in vivo release of platelet-specific proteins and fibrinopeptides, (iv) platelet hemostatic plug formation, (v) thrombin-induced platelet aggregation ex vivo, and (vi) thrombin-induced blood clotting. The effects of FPRCH2Cl largely disappeared within 15 min after the infusion had been discontinued. FPRCH2Cl produced no detectable cardiovascular or other acute side effects. In contrast, sustained comparably anticoagulating levels of heparin had no effect upon 111In-platelet graft deposition, graft occlusion, platelet function as measured by the bleeding time, platelet aggregation ex vivo, or release of platelet-specific proteins in vivo. We conclude that thrombin is the principal mediator of platelet-dependent hemostatic plug formation and of the formation of platelet-dependent high-flow acute graft thrombosis and occlusion. Moreover, FPRCH2Cl or other synthetic antithrombins may provide effective antithrombotic therapy for both arterial and venous thrombosis by simultaneously inhibiting platelet activation and fibrin formation.\r"

Monoclonal antibodies that distinguish between these isozymes are used in the present study to map isozyme distribution in the rat brain with immunohistochemical techniques. Both isozymes are localized in neurons, and, whereas PLC-II is rather ubiquitous--being expressed in most neurons, PLC-I is restricted in its distribution. The strongest immunoreactive labeling for PLC-I is in the neurons of the striatum, which provide inputs to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, where terminals are also densely labeled. The neuronal targets of these terminals in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra do not express PLC-I immunoreactivity, but they do display PLC-II immunoreactivity. PLC-I immunoreactivity is also particularly well pronounced in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and, to a lesser extent, in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. In the thalamus, PLC-I is localized to neurons in the reticular thalamic nucleus, in the medial subdivision of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, and in the anteromedial thalamic nucleus. Other areas displaying PLC-I immunoreactive neurons include the dorsal lateral septal nucleus and the basolateral amygdala. The expression of at least one or more forms of PLC in most neurons of the brain suggests that this enzyme may be part of a common system of signal transduction used universally by all neurons. However, the differential expression of PLC isozymes suggests further that certain neurotransmitter and receptor interactions may differ in the forms of the PLC enzyme used for signal transduction.\r"

The high-affinity site was discretely located, with highest densities in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercule, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and the molecular layers of the cerebellum. This site did not correlate well with the distribution of adenylate cyclase. The high-affinity striatal binding site may be associated with a stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein. Thus, the number of sites was increased by the addition of Mg2+ and guanylyl imidodiphosphate. Cholera toxin stereotaxically injected into one rat striatum increased the number of binding sites, and no further increase was noted following the subsequent addition of guanyl nucleotide. High-affinity forskolin binding sites in non-dopamine-rich brain areas (hippocampus and cerebellum) were modulated in a qualitatively different manner by guanyl nucleotides. In these areas the number of binding sites was significantly reduced by the addition of guanyl nucleotide. These results suggest that forskolin may have a potential role in identifying different functional/structural guanine nucleotide-binding proteins.\r"

However, experiments using a proenkephalin cDNA probe revealed that the content of proenkephalin mRNA was considerably lower than that of prodynorphin mRNA. Following five brief trains of high-frequency electrical stimulation to the dentate gyrus, the proenkephalin mRNA content of the granule cells, measured 22 hr later, was substantially increased on the stimulated side. In contrast, levels of prodynorphin mRNA were markedly decreased ipsilateral to the stimulation site. These results were confirmed by RNA blot analysis of extracted mRNA. The decrease in prodynorphin mRNA content first became apparent between 4 and 7 hr after the end of stimulation. Distinct mechanisms, therefore, regulate the expression of proenkephalin mRNA and prodynorphin mRNA in rat hippocampus.\r"

By E15 this form is present at about 50% of its adult abundance relative to other poly(A)+ mRNA species. At birth the abundance is approximately the same as in the adult. In contrast, the enzyme activity level is only 8% of the adult level at birth and takes 3 weeks to reach adult levels. There are qualitative changes in GAD mRNA during development. Several large (7-9 kilobases) transcripts with strong homology to GAD are enriched in early developmental stages but are barely detectable in the adult. A nuclease protection assay shows a developmentally regulated heterogeneity in a coding portion of the mRNA.\r"

  ".W": "The \"kindling\" phenomenon is associated with long-lasting facilitation of synaptic transmission. A possible mechanism of such facilitation could involve changes in the number of synaptic contacts. However, previous attempts to demonstrate a synaptic morphological alteration that could account for the long-term effects of kindling had failed, possibly due to the unavailability, at the time, of unbiased methods for synapse quantitation. Using the unbiased stereological disector technique, we estimated the number of synapses per neuron in the middle molecular layer of the hippocampal dentate gyrus in rats kindled by electrical stimulation of the medial perforant path with implanted electrodes. Unkindled but stimulated (coulombic control) and unstimulated but implanted rats served as controls. Animals were coded and killed 4 weeks after reaching the kindling criterion of five generalized seizures. The most important results were obtained when axospinous synapses with continuous or discontinuous postsynaptic densities (\"nonperforated\" or \"perforated\" synapses) were differentially analyzed. Kindling resulted in a selective loss of nonperforated synaptic contacts in contrast to preservation of perforated ones. Furthermore, the ratio of perforated to nonperforated synapses was increased by 45% or 40% in kindled rats relative to unstimulated or coulombic controls, respectively. These findings suggest that synaptic efficacy may depend on a balance of the two synaptic types; selective elimination of nonperforated synapses may augment the potency of remaining synaptic contacts, a process reminiscent of synaptic remodeling during development.\r"

Data on 134 patients with running-related injuries were evaluated to establish the factors that were associated with specific pain sites. Patient data consisted of a brief running history and measurements of 72 anatomical variables that have been cited in the literature as predisposers to running-related injuries. The descriptive statistics indicated certain associations of variables with each pain group. A factor analysis was used to eliminate multicollinearity and to reduce the 72 variables to 9 factors. The results of a discriminant function analysis using factor scores indicated that patients' membership in one of six pain groups could be predicted correctly in 29.1% of the cases. We concluded that the factors used in this study were not good predictors of pain groups. Physical therapists, however, should publish their data on runners' injuries, treatment, and rehabilitation to supplement the published data that relate anatomical and biomechanical factors to running-related injuries.\r"

Subjects underwent a pretraining urodynamic evaluation and were reexamined after four weeks of exercise training. Paired t tests of subjects' pretraining and posttraining values of bladder capacity, functional urethral length, and static urethral pressure profile showed no significant differences. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the covariates of weight, motivation, and age did not significantly influence subjects' bladder capacity, functional urethral length, or static urethral pressure profile. Nine of the 14 subjects had a negative result on the posttraining urinary stress test (R = 0, p less than .01).

The results of this study demonstrated that with a very specific protocol, the reliability of concentric peak torque and work measurements was excellent at 60 degrees and 120 degrees/sec and good at 180 degrees/sec.

Duration percentages of subjects' stereotypic hand behavior and functional hand use were calculated from five-minute videotaped segments recorded during a finger-feeding condition and a free-time condition. All three subjects demonstrated a decrease in the amount of time spent in stereotypic hand behavior after application of hand splints, and one subject showed an increase in finger-feeding skills while wearing hand splints. Limitations of the study are discussed, and suggestions for clinical application and future research are offered.\r"

These measurements may be used in treatment planning, such as in the prescription of specialized shoes or orthoses. Therefore, reliability of these measurements, as they are obtained clinically, must be determined. The purpose of this study was to examine the reliability of measurements of the STJN position and of ankle and STJ PROM. To determine reliability, repeated measurements of the STJN position and of STJ PROM were taken on the involved feet of 43 patients with neurologic orthopedic disorders (including both feet of 7 patients), and measurements of ankle PROM (dorsiflexion and plantar flexion) were taken on 42 of these patients (including both feet of 7 patients). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for intratester reliability ranged from .74 to .90 for ankle and STJ measurements. The ICCs for intertester reliability were .25 for measuring the STJN position, .32 for STJ inversion, and .17 for SJJ eversion. The ICCs for intertester reliability were .50 for ankle dorsiflexion and .72 for ankle plantar flexion. Goniometric measurements of the STJN position and of PROM of the ankle and STJ appear to be moderately reliable if taken by the same therapist over a short period of time. With the exception of ankle plantar flexion, these measurements cannot be considered to be reliable between therapists.\r"

Six of the regression analyses were significant, but three had similar correlations that were much higher than the rest. The variables in those three regression analyses were ACT composite score and both GPAs; ACT composite score, both GPAs, and interview score; and ACT composite score, prerequisite GPA, and interview score. The results of this study suggest that selection committees use standardized ability tests as admission criteria because the ACT scores accounted for the most variance in licensing examination scores.

  ".W": "To assess the potential of a porous hydroxyapatite matrix to serve as a bone graft substitute, bilateral 15 X 20 mm craniectomy defects were reconstructed in 17 dogs with blocks of implant and split-rib autografts. Specimens were retrieved at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 months, and undecalcified sections were prepared for microscopy and histometry. The implant and graft cross-sectional areas did not change with time, documenting their equivalent ability to maintain cranial contour. Bone ingrowth extended across the implant from one cranial shelf to the other in 15 specimens. Little apparent bone ingrowth was seen in most graft specimens. Two implants and three grafts were nonunited, possibly due to lack of fixation or the orientation of the histology sections. The implant specimens were composed of 39.3 percent hydroxyapatite matrix, 17.2 percent bone ingrowth, and 43.5 percent soft-tissue ingrowth. The graft specimens were composed of 43.7 percent bone and 56.3 percent soft tissue. This study supported the thesis that a porous hydroxyapatite matrix may function in part as a bone graft substitute. The brittle hydroxyapatite matrix undoubtedly became stronger with bone ingrowth, but the degree of cranial protection achieved was not measured in this study. The size of the cranial defect used in this study did not permit estimation of the distance over which bone ingrowth may be reliably expected. There remains a need for greater understanding of the causes of nonunion, the extent of predictable ingrowth depth, and the strength of the resultant implant-bone composite.\r"

Defects of standard size were created bilaterally through the mandibular angles of rats. On one side of the jaw the defect was covered with Teflon membranes, whereas the defect on the other side served as control. Histologic analysis after healing demonstrated that on the test (membrane) side, half the number of animals showed complete bone healing after 3 weeks and all animals showed complete healing after 6 weeks. Little or no sign of healing was evident on the control side even after an observation period of 22 weeks.\r"

While narrower margins of resection for thinner, low-risk stage I malignant melanomas appear safe, the exact minimum margin of resection needed to satisfy both oncologic and cosmetic considerations, whether 1 or 2 cm, will need to be determined by a large prospective, randomized study.\r"
