  ".W": "A random walk method, based on the Metropolis algorithm, is developed for simulating the distribution of trait and linkage marker genotypes in pedigrees where trait phenotypes are already known. The method complements techniques suggested by Ploughman and Boehnke and by Ott that are based on sequential sampling of genotypes within a pedigree. These methods are useful for estimating the power of linkage analysis before complete study of a pedigree is undertaken. We apply the random walk technique to a partially penetrant disease, schizophrenia, and to a recessive disease, ataxia-telangiectasia. In the first case we show that accessory phenotypes with higher penetrance than that of schizophrenia itself may be crucial for effective linkage analysis, and in the second case we show that impressionistic selection of informative pedigrees may be misleading.\r"

Seven had the mutation IVS-2 nt654 (C----T), one had the mutation codon 41/42 (deletion CTTT), and one had the mutation codon 17 (AAG----TAG). Another six with the mutation IVS-1 nt1 (G----T), one with the mutation IVS-1 nt1 (G----A), four with the mutation codon 15 (TGG----TAG), one with a mutation codon 30 (AGG----ACG), and one with a mutation codon 35 (deletion C) were first identified by direct sequencing of a patient's genomic DNA followed by further hybridizing other patients' DNA with the appropriate oligonucleotide probes. Five did not carry the common mutations previously described in Asian populations. The four most prevalent mutations encountered made up 83% of the total number of beta-thalassemic chromosomes studied. The most common mutation, IVS-1 nt5 (G----C), was mostly associated with two different haplotypes.\r"

  ".W": "In order to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of oral ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis and trace the possible development of resistance over time, three trials were conducted. In an open-label, uncontrolled trial, 25 courses of ciprofloxacin were administered to 16 patients. Efficacy and safety were assessed based on changes in short-term clinical scores, white blood cell counts, Pseudomonas aeruginosa counts in sputum, pulmonary function tests, and standard serum chemistries and urinalysis that were performed before therapy, weekly during therapy, at the end of therapy, and at a seven-day follow-up visit after therapy. In an open-label, randomized, controlled study, the efficacy and tolerance of oral ciprofloxacin were compared with those of intravenous tobramycin and azlocillin. In another study, the rate of susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients during more than two years of clinical use was determined. In the uncontrolled trial, ciprofloxacin therapy was associated with clinical improvement in most cases with changes in short-term clinical score and forced expiratory volume in one second being statistically significant (p less than 0.05). Twenty-five patients were entered in the controlled trial with 12 patients in each treatment group being evaluable. The groups were comparable based on admitting demographic and disease characteristics, and no differences in therapeutic response or side effects were noted between the two treatments (p greater than 0.5). Bacterial susceptibility to ciprofloxacin has remained relatively stable over time. Based on these results as well as those from similar evaluations, ciprofloxacin appears to be efficacious in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in adults with cystic fibrosis, producing responses similar to those observed with standard intravenous antibiotic therapy.\r"

The last 23 patients with malignant external otitis were treated with ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice daily, combined with local excision of the aural lesion. The records of 61 of our previous 68 patients who underwent surgery and were hospitalized and treated with an intravenous extended-spectrum penicillin and gentamicin for six to eight weeks, were analyzed. Twenty-one of 23 patients treated with ciprofloxacin were cured; therapy failed in two patients. Treatment averaged 16.8 days of hospitalization, and bacteriologic eradication was achieved after an average of 7.04 days, as compared with 49 and 15.3 days, respectively, in the group of patients with the intravenous treatment. The mean peak concentrations of ciprofloxacin in serum varied between 2.5 and 3.7 micrograms/ml, and the drug concentrations in different ear tissues were 0.2 to 13 micrograms/g. The treatment with ciprofloxacin was well tolerated with no significant side effects, whereas serious side effects were noted in 45.9 percent of the previous intravenously treated group. The concentrations of the drug in serum and ear tissues were higher than the average minimal inhibitory concentration for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Use of ciprofloxacin treatment, combined with local excision of the aural lesion, will bring about healing of malignant external otitis in the majority of cases. Ciprofloxacin can be given on an ambulatory basis after a relatively short period of hospitalization.\r"

Pretreatment and post-treatment cervical culture specimens were obtained for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Pretreatment and post-treatment endometrial culture specimens were obtained for those organisms plus facultative and anaerobic bacteria. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined on all isolates by agar dilution. Clinical resolution of infection was seen in 31 of 33 (94 percent) ciprofloxacin-treated patients compared with 34 of 35 (97 percent) clindamycin/gentamicin-treated patients. N. gonorrhoeae was eradicated in all cases and C. trachomatis in 12 of 13 cases (92 percent). Ciprofloxacin appeared less effective than clindamycin/gentamicin in eradicating bacterial-vaginosis-associated organisms from post-treatment culture specimens obtained from the endometrium. Comparable clinical response was seen with both regimens. The significance of persistent bacterial-vaginosis-associated organisms following ciprofloxacin therapy is unclear. However, since one goal of treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease should be to eliminate organisms from the upper genital tract, ciprofloxacin may not provide optimal single-agent therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease.\r"

Twenty-seven additional patients with 29 infections who were not appropriate for random assignment were treated in an open study with intravenously administered ciprofloxacin only; the latter infections were generally more serious or were caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms. The most common doses were ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously and 500 mg orally every 12 hours and ceftazidime, 1 to 2 g intravenously every eight to 12 hours. Forty-seven ciprofloxacin-treated infections and 31 ceftazidime-treated infections were evaluable for determination of efficacy. Infections included lower respiratory tract (21 infections), urinary (37 infections), skin/soft tissue (14 infections), bacteremia/endocarditis (four infections), colitis (one infection), and mastoiditis (one infection). Median minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were, respectively: for Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis, no more than 0.06 and no more than 0.25 micrograms/ml; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml; for Enterococcus faecalis, 1 and more than 32 micrograms/ml; and for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 8 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously, yielded mean serum concentrations 0.5 and eight hours post-intravenous infusion of 2.3 and 0.7 micrograms/ml, respectively. Satisfactory clinical responses were achieved in 17 (81 percent) of 21 patients with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, 22 (71 percent) of 31 patients with ceftazidime, and 20 (77 percent) of 26 patients with intravenous ciprofloxacin. The most common treatment failures occurred in complicated skin/soft-tissue infections treated with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, complicated urinary tract infections treated with ceftazidime, and necrotizing P. aeruginosa pneumonia treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin; the pneumonia patients all had respiratory failure and had been previously unresponsive to treatment with other appropriate drugs. Serious adverse reactions were observed in three patients, seizures with intravenous ciprofloxacin in two patients, and Clostridium difficile diarrhea with ceftazidime in one patient. We conclude that sequential intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were comparable in efficacy and safety; the ability to change from intravenous to oral therapy is a major convenience. Intravenous ciprofloxacin was useful for more serious infections, often caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms.\r"

Fifteen patients (30 percent) were bacteremic. Causative organisms included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32 patients), other gram-negative bacilli (18 patients), and gram-positive cocci (nine patients). Minimal inhibitory concentrations ranged between 0.03 and 1 microgram/ml. Mean peak serum concentrations were 1.58 micrograms/ml (intravenous) and 2 micrograms/ml (oral); mean trough serum concentrations were 0.23 micrograms/ml (intravenous) and 0.32 micrograms/ml (oral). Serum bactericidal activity values achieved after intravenous and oral therapy were similar. Response to therapy was evaluated separately in patients with or without osteomyelitis. In 30 patients with infections other than osteomyelitis, clinical cure was achieved in 27 (90 percent), and therapy failure occurred in three patients. In the 20 remaining patients with osteomyelitis, 15 (75 percent) had a satisfactory response, with apparent cure after a mean follow-up of 11 months, whereas five had therapeutical failure (P. aeruginosa became resistant in four of them). Overall, no major adverse effects were encountered. Superinfection by a resistant P. aeruginosa was observed in three patients. Intravenous ciprofloxacin is an effective and safe agent for the therapy of severe infections caused by susceptible organisms.\r"

Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.\r"

Ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and ampicillin were tested with regard to binding or inactivation by pus. The bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin and imipenem were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Staphylococcus aureus in human pus with a pH of 6.0 incubated at 37 degrees C under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The effect of single or combination drug therapy with 20 mg/kg of ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or rifampin given every 12 hours was tested against E. coli or P. aeruginosa in polymicrobic murine abscesses that had been produced by subcutaneous injection of either of those organisms mixed with Bacteroides fragilis and autoclaved human stool. Antibiotic levels and the number of bacteria surviving in pus were quantitated. Therapy of subcutaneous abscesses was delayed 72 hours to test drug efficacy against organisms in well-established infections. Levels of ampicillin, imipenem, or ciprofloxacin were reduced from 10 micrograms/ml to 3.1 +/- 4.0, 2.7 +/- 3, or 5.8 +/- 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, after incubation in eight pus specimens for 24 hours at 37 degrees C. Ampicillin levels were reduced to less than 1 microgram/ml in four pus specimens containing beta-lactamase. Imipenem levels were undetectable in two specimens and were 0.2 micrograms/ml in one specimen. Ciprofloxacin binding to pus supernate or sediment appeared to be explained by its binding to the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) present in pus. Activity of 5 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin against four E. coli or K. pneumoniae strains in pus in vitro was greater than that of twofold higher concentrations of imipenem. The bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin and imipenem were comparable but substantially reduced against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in pus. Ciprofloxacin alone or regimens combining ciprofloxacin with rifampin or rifampin plus imipenem reduced the number of E. coli in polymicrobic subcutaneous abscesses but had little effect on P. aeruginosa in polymicrobic abscesses. The anaerobic abscess milieu appeared to inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa. Ciprofloxacin activity in abscess fluid did not appear to be adversely affected by acid pH, aerobic or anaerobic conditions of incubation, the abscess constituents, or the binding of ciprofloxacin to the DNA in pus. Ciprofloxacin was bound to DNA of bacterial or human origin. Binding by pus was reversible, and binding to DNA extracts of pus was blocked by pretreatment of extracts with deoxyribonuclease but not by pretreatment with ribonuclease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Intravenous ciprofloxacin was given to 20 patients with gram-negative bacillary meningitis. The dose of ciprofloxacin was 200 mg by intravenous infusion, over 30 minutes, every 12 hours for 10 days. Two patients also received intravenous cefotaxime and penicillin G. All patients were monitored daily. Of 20 patients, 18 had cure and therapy failed in two. Because relatively low concentrations of ciprofloxacin are achieved in the CSF, the drug should be used in the treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis only if the MICs of the causative pathogen and the ciprofloxacin concentration in CSF can be followed. A randomized, controlled study is needed to compare the efficacy of intravenous ciprofloxacin with standard antibiotic therapy in the treatment of this disease.\r"

The overall clinical response rate was 78 percent, 73 percent for neutropenic patients and 79 percent for patients with adequate neutrophil counts. Favorable responses were observed in 19 of 25 patients with bacteremia, 29 of 44 patients with pneumonia, 16 of 18 patients with skin and soft-tissue infection, nine of nine patients with urinary tract infection, 10 of 11 patients with upper respiratory infection, and 26 of 34 patients with fever of undetermined origin. Gram-negative infections were associated with a response rate of 94 percent, gram-positive infections with a response rate of 75 percent, and polymicrobial infections with a response rate of 82 percent. Resistance to ciprofloxacin did not develop and no superinfections were seen. Toxicity was minor except in one patient, in whom a seizure developed. Intravenously administered ciprofloxacin is effective and safe therapy for many infections in cancer patients.\r"

Patients were followed closely for side effects and adverse reactions as well as for their response to therapy. Culture specimens and laboratory parameters including serum chemistry profile, complete blood cell count, and urinalysis were obtained before, during (every four to five days), and after ciprofloxacin therapy. Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates was determined by the microtiter technique. Patients were considered to have had a successful outcome if satisfactory improvement in signs and symptoms of infection occurred as well as bacteriologic cure, such as eradication of organisms from the blood during and after treatment. Of 30 septic episodes in 30 patients, 27 episodes were considered evaluable. Two septic episodes occurred in patients who were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count less than 1,000/mm3). The sources of the 27 septic episodes were intra-abdominal (12 patients), indwelling intravenous access devices (11 patients), urinary tract (three patients), and skin/soft tissue (one patient). Of the 27 evaluable episodes, 24 (88.9 percent) had a completely successful outcome; three (11.1 percent) had a partially successful outcome. Partial successes included the occurrence of a Klebsiella pneumoniae reinfection in one patient, superinfection with Listeria monocytogenes in another patient with the concurrent development of a highly ciprofloxacin-resistant K. pneumoniae, and the recovery of a ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa during therapy in a third patient who also had superinfection due to Candida albicans. There were minimal ciprofloxacin-related adverse reactions and side effects. Although ciprofloxacin was generally well tolerated with minimal side effects and adverse reactions and was efficacious in the treatment of serious septicemic infections caused by gram-negative aerobic bacilli, the development of a resistant K. pneumoniae and the recovery of a resistant P. aeruginosa during therapy in two cases are of concern and deserve further investigation.\r"

Ninety-six patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy: 50 patients received CB and 46 patients received NP. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age or primary diagnosis. Overall clinical response rate at the end of therapy was 66 percent for CB and 65 percent for NP. Microbiologic assessment revealed more pathogens eradicated by CB (64 percent) and fewer persisting (4 percent) than in the NP group (52 percent eradicated, 13 percent persisting). Only 10 percent of patients in the CB group had treatment-related adverse reactions as opposed to 28 percent of the NP-treated patients; these were predominantly renal impairment and were likely to have been due to the aminoglycoside. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most commonly isolated pathogen, accounting for 38 percent of all isolates and 30 percent of all patients in whom treatment failed. Although streptococci accounted for 18 percent of the isolated pathogens, no treatment failures or superinfections were due to these organisms. This indicates an advantage of combining ciprofloxacin with benzylpenicillin. We conclude that the CB regimen is as effective as the NP treatment and is associated with fewer side effects.\r"

In the long-term studies of rats and mice, ciprofloxacin was given as food admixture in concentrations up to 5,000 ppm for 24 and 21 months, respectively. This treatment regimen did not result in any systemic toxicity and also did not give any indication of a tumorigenic effect of ciprofloxacin. In a study of juvenile dogs to investigate development of arthropathogenic lesions using magnetic resonance imaging techniques, an increase in width of the recessus suprapatellaris occurred only in those dogs in which marginal effects developed. Thus, this technique may be a suitable method to monitor juvenile patients receiving ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin was also studied for its potential to act as an abortifacient when given orally or parenterally to cynomolgus monkeys. The data obtained did not give any indication of teratogenicity or embryolethality, and mean patterns of progesterone were similar between routes of administration, dose groups, and controls. Finally, data are presented that demonstrate that central nervous system interaction toxicity between quinolones and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be observed in rats only at therapeutically irrelevant high dose levels.\r"

Therefore, the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities of ciprofloxacin in combination with clindamycin or metronidazole were investigated using a randomized crossover study design in 10 healthy volunteers. Ciprofloxacin (200 mg) was administered alone and in combination with clindamycin (600 mg) or metronidazole (500 mg); all drugs were given intravenously over 30 minutes. Serum and urine concentrations of the substances were measured using standard methods (high-performance liquid chromatography or gas chromatography). Blood samples for determination of serum bactericidal activity against five different aerobic and two anaerobic bacterial species (a total of 58 strains) were obtained one hour and six hours after drug infusion. All values were statistically analyzed by use of the Student t test.\r"

Pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in maternal blood and amniotic fluid were studied after two doses of ciprofloxacin (200 mg intravenously every 12 hours), after two doses of pefloxacin (400 mg intravenously every 12 hours), and after two doses of ofloxacin (400 mg intravenously every 12 hours). Twenty patients were studied in each group. The ranges of mean maternal serum and amniotic fluid levels were as follows: ciprofloxacin in maternal serum 0.01 to 0.28 micrograms/ml, in amniotic fluid 0.1 to 0.13 micrograms/ml; pefloxacin in maternal serum 2.65 to 4.31 micrograms/ml, in amniotic fluid 1.97 to 2.74 micrograms/ml; and ofloxacin in maternal serum 0.07 to 0.68 micrograms/ml, in amniotic fluid 0.13 to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Three groups of lactating women (10 women in each), were given three doses of 750 mg ciprofloxacin orally, 400 mg pefloxacin orally, and 400 mg ofloxacin orally. Serum and milk samples were obtained simultaneously at two, four, six, nine, 12, and 24 hours after dosage administration. The mean breast milk levels of ciprofloxacin at the corresponding time intervals were 3.79, 2.26, 0.86, 0.51, 0.20, and 0.02 micrograms/ml. The mean breast milk levels of pefloxacin were 3.54, 3.43, 2.93, 2.24, 1.79, and 0.88 micrograms/ml, and of ofloxacin, 2.41, 1.91, 1.25, 0.64, 0.29, and 0.05 micrograms/ml. It is concluded that all studied quinolones penetrate the placenta and are found in amniotic fluid at low concentrations and at much higher levels in breast milk. Because of the potential for quinolones to cause arthropathy in juvenile animals, their use should be avoided in pregnant and lactating women.\r"

Secondary nosocomial pneumonias were the predominant infection in most patients. A total of 88 causative pathogens were isolated from 50 patients. The most commonly isolated organism was Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter sp. were also isolated. Pathogens could not be detected in four patients (three patients with pneumonia, one patient with urinary tract infection). Ciprofloxacin was administered intravenously, either 400 mg every 12 hours or, after a loading dose of 600 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, 400 mg every 12 hours on successive treatment days. A total of 44 patients were treated parenterally, four orally. An additional six patients received ciprofloxacin in both dosage forms as sequential therapy. Serum ciprofloxacin levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in 17 patients. The serum concentrations and the elimination half-life were in accordance with values already published for parenteral doses of 200 and 500 mg ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin clearance was linear even at the high dose (600 mg every 12 hours loading dose) and no cumulative effect was observed. Clinical outcome was very good. Cure was achieved in 21 patients, and clinical improvement occurred in 23 (favorable clinical response rate, 82 percent). Two patients did not respond to therapy, and eight patients were not evaluable. Adverse effects occurred in 12 patients: transient elevation of liver enzymes (seven patients), temporary increase in serum creatinine levels (two), convulsions (two), and exanthem (one). The treatment of severe infections in intensive care patients with higher doses of parenteral ciprofloxacin appears to be considerably more effective than therapy with the doses of intravenous ciprofloxacin recommended to date. Therefore, these preliminary results are the subject of an ongoing double-blind study.\r"

  ".W": "The single-dose absorption kinetics of ciprofloxacin in different regions of the human gastrointestinal tract were investigated using a remote-control drug delivery device (HF-capsule). Doses of 180 to 200 mg ciprofloxacin (as a lactic acid solution) were placed in the HF-capsule and administered to four healthy male adults. The position of the HF-capsule in the gastrointestinal tract was checked via radiographic examination. The release of the solution from the HF-capsule was induced by a radio signal. In each volunteer, the solution was released into five different regions of the gastrointestinal tract: the stomach (B), jejunum (C1), ileum (C2), ascending colon (D1), and descending colon (D2). Two control runs (A1, A2), involving oral administration of the solution, were used as a reference for calculation of area under the curve. The oral administration of a conventional 250-mg tablet (A3) was also studied. The plasma concentration of ciprofloxacin and urine concentrations of ciprofloxacin, desethylene- (M1), sulfo- (M2), and oxociprofloxacin (M3) were determined fluorimetrically by high-performance liquid chromatography. Intraindividual comparisons indicated a progressive decrease in the amount of ciprofloxacin absorbed (100 percent = mean of AUCA1 and AUCA2) from the jejunum (-61 percent, median), ileum (-75 percent), colon ascendens (-90 percent), and colon descendens (-95 percent). Absolute amounts of renally excreted ciprofloxacin and metabolites decreased due to the reduced absorption of ciprofloxacin, but the metabolite pattern was unchanged. It is concluded that the main absorption site for ciprofloxacin is the upper part of the intestinal tract (duodenum, jejunum).\r"

Although the mean values were similar to those previously reported, significant individual differences were observed, with the coefficient of variation ranging from 41 to 61 percent. Non-renal clearance appeared to have a bimodal distribution. The dosage studied appeared to provide adequate serum concentration profiles to treat most pathogens found in infected trauma patients. However, the use of higher doses and more frequent dosing may be required to treat patients with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.\r"

This study was performed in 10 patients (four women and six men) ranging in age from 26 to 64 years and body weight ranging from 46 to 88 kg. Ciprofloxacin therapy was started eight to 48 days (mean, 21 days) after transplantation, whereas the cyclosporine therapy was administered for seven to 48 days (mean, 18 days) post-transplant. Both ciprofloxacin and cyclosporine were administered every 12 hours. The mean cyclosporine dosage was 2.4 mg/kg per day, adjusted to obtain blood concentrations within the recommended range (i.e., 100 to 200 ng/ml). The ciprofloxacin dosage was 750 mg orally twice daily for all patients. A pharmacokinetic study of cyclosporine was performed in each patient the day before starting ciprofloxacin treatment and after the 13th ciprofloxacin administration (i.e., Day 7 of ciprofloxacin therapy). Cyclosporine concentrations were measured in whole blood by a specific high-performance liquid chromatography method and the following parameters were determined: minimal and maximal blood concentrations, area under the curve from zero to 12 hours, total body oral clearance, mean residence time, and elimination half life. Concurrently administered medications and serum creatinine values were recorded. No statistically significant difference was noted between the cyclosporine pharmacokinetic parameters before and during ciprofloxacin treatment. Serum creatinine levels were increased in four of 10 patients, but the increase was not considered related to ciprofloxacin treatment. In conclusion, it appears that ciprofloxacin can be administered to renal transplant patients without risk of interacting cyclosporine or enhancement of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. Additional cyclosporine blood level monitoring is not particularly valuable in this setting.\r"

In vivo studies involved an intraindividual comparison of the single-dose kinetics of caffeine before and during quinolone administration in 12 healthy men. Changes of enzymatic caffeine degradation by the quinolones were studied in vitro using human liver microsomes from three donors. Enoxacin and pipemidic acid markedly prolonged caffeine elimination in vivo. A positive correlation exists between the doses of enoxacin or ciprofloxacin and the prolongation (increases) in the caffeine elimination half-life. Decreases in caffeine elimination, using doses of ciprofloxacin in the upper part of the recommended dose range, were approximately 1.5-fold in comparison with untreated control subjects, whereas in the case of enoxacin there was a sixfold change. In vitro results with enoxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and pipemidic acid show a competitive inhibition (Dixon plots) of caffeine 3-demethylation. Ciprofloxacin and enoxacin showed the strongest inhibitory effects in vitro, whereas ofloxacin had the lowest inhibitory effect. These results are qualitatively reflected in the in vivo results; however, the clinical effects may be dependent on pharmacokinetic disposition of the quinolone and this could explain the weak inhibitory action of ciprofloxacin in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "90072220\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the recent incidence of infection and to evaluate antimicrobial usage among adult leukemic patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at Stanford University Hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 142 adult patients from a consecutive series of 226 induction or consolidation/maintenance chemotherapy courses for AML or ALL between 1982 to 1986 were reviewed retrospectively. Data were analyzed to compare the infectious disease complications and antimicrobial usage for patients receiving identical chemotherapy for a specific phase of leukemia treatment. Evaluation for each chemotherapy course included assessments for the following: compliance with criteria for initiating antibiotics, incidence of infection that was documented by culture or clinical criteria, predictive value of surveillance cultures, incidence of superinfection, survival outcomes, antimicrobial usage, antibiotic-related adverse effects, and cost for antibiotics and diagnostic studies. RESULTS: Antimicrobials were employed in 190 (84%) of 226 chemotherapy courses. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were regularly begun within the first five days of admission and they were continued for an average of 3.5 weeks until the granulocyte count was greater than 1,000/microL after discontinuation of chemotherapy. There were no differences in the types of infection or outcomes among the patient groups. There was only a 37% rate of documented infections by culture or clinical signs among these patients during their entire hospital stay. Bacterial infections, especially those caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci in patients with Hickman catheters, accounted for 93% of the episodes. Viral and fungal infections accounted for 4% and 3% of documented cases, respectively, and occurred more than 10 days after the institution of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. A total of 922 different antimicrobials were employed in 190 courses (average 4.9 per course). The rationale for excessive usage and multiple changes was a persistent or intermittent fever, rather than documented infection(s). This practice led to usage of more broad-spectrum and expensive antibiotics. Further analyses indicate that the greater number of antibiotics employed correlated with apparent increased toxicity, especially renal and hepatic adverse reactions. These toxicities were associated with higher rates of fatal outcomes, i.e., 12 (39%) of 31 patients died with antibiotic-associated hepatic and/or renal insufficiency, compared with 12 (7.5%) of 159 patients who died without antibiotic-associated organ damage. CONCLUSION: Excessive antibiotic usage and multiple antibiotic changes among adult leukemic patients undergoing chemotherapy appear to increase the risks of adverse hepatic and renal effects and death. Furthermore, this practice leads to use of more broad-spectrum and expensive antibiotics...\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to define risk factors for nosocomial candidemia in adult patients without leukemia at a tertiary care medical center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with nosocomial candidemia between August 1, 1981, and October 31, 1984, were included if they met strict selection criteria and did not have acute or chronic leukemia. For each case, one control was selected from among patients admitted during the same month/year and matched for hospital service and duration of hospitalization up to the first blood culture that grew Candida species. Logistic regression was used to obtain estimates of risk after simultaneously controlling for other variables. RESULTS: Candida albicans caused 24 of the 48 fungemias studied. The risk factors identified included the presence of a central line (odds ratio, 26.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 451.1); bladder catheter (13.0 1.3 to 131.4); two or more antibiotics (25.1, 2.1 to 318); azotemia (22.1, 2.2 to 223.2); transfer from another hospital (21.3, 1.7 to 274.5); diarrhea (10.2, 1.03 to 101.4); and candiduria (27.0, 1.7 to 423.5). A prior surgical procedure was associated with lowered risk (0.1, 0.01 to 0.9), suggesting perhaps that medical service patients are at higher risk than those on surgical services. Because total parenteral nutrition was always administered by means of a central line, it could not be shown to increase the risk over that conferred by a central line alone. CONCLUSIONS: This study has defined seven major risk factors for nosocomial candidemia. These findings should facilitate development of rational approaches to preventing infection and may assist clinicians in identifying those patients in whom this life-threatening complication is likely to occur.\r"

We prospectively evaluated the clinical utility of a new, promising commercial latex particle agglutination test (i.e., Cand-Tec, Ramco Laboratories, Inc., Houston, Texas). This assay detects Candida antigens in serum. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the reliability of Cand-Tec to diagnose invasive candidiasis in 142 consecutive in-patients intensively treated with chemo-radiation therapy. Serum samples were collected at admission and then weekly, until the patients' death or hospital discharge. Evaluation for clinical utility was done using various reference titers. Twenty-nine patients had invasive candidiasis whereas 113 patients did not have documented invasive candidal infections. RESULTS: At a titer of 1:8, the Cand-Tec test had sensitivity of 38%, specificity of 90%, positive predictive value of 50%, and negative predictive value of 85%. Weekly use of the Cand-Tec test did not improve early detection of invasive candidiasis, providing only a mean interval of 0.4 day from the first positive Cand-Tec result to a definitive diagnosis of invasive candidiasis by blood culture, tissue biopsy, or autopsy. In addition, surveillance cultures from the oropharynx or stool were not helpful in identifying those patients who would develop an invasive fungal infection. CONCLUSION: In the context of current clinical management strategies for suspected fungal infection, the Candida antigen detection assay (Cand-Tec) is not a reliable method for diagnosis of deep candidiasis in neutropenic patients. Until better methods of early detection are available, patients at high risk for the development of invasive candidiasis should continue to receive empiric antifungal agent therapy.\r"

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty HIV-seropositive homosexual or bisexual men from the San Francisco City Clinic Cohort Study were recruited for the study; of these, 20 met the eligibility criteria. Treatment with zidovudine and acyclovir was open label. Pharmacokinetic, virologic, immunologic, and clinical data were collected periodically over a 24-week period. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analysis showed no drug interaction. The combination was generally well tolerated, and hematologic parameters remained stable through 24 weeks. There were no significant changes in total lymphocytes, T4 lymphocytes, overall skin test reactivity, or ability to culture virus from peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: This combination of agents is safe in this population for at least six months. Conclusions about long-term tolerance and efficacy await the results of larger trials with longer follow-up.\r"

We studied DO2 VO2, and exercise capacity in 12 stable, ambulatory patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receiving ambient air and 26% oxygen to ascertain whether VO2 is dependent on DO2 in this patient sample. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An exercise protocol consisting of a symptom-limited, low-level treadmill test with progressive increments in workload was performed twice, once with patients breathing ambient air and once with patients breathing 26% oxygen. Expired gas, arterial and mixed venous blood values, and recordings of systemic and pulmonary artery pressures were obtained after a 10-minute period of rest (while standing) and during the last minute of each three-minute exercise level. RESULTS: Five patients had an increase in exercise capacity, defined as an increase in the maximal VO2 greater than 25%, using supplemental oxygen. In these patients, oxygen delivery increased from 10.9 +/- 3.4 to 13.8 +/- 4.7 mL/minute/kg (p = 0.008) at rest and from 16.2 +/- 5.0 to 24.7 +/- 2.7 mL/minute/kg (p = 0.046) during exercise with supplemental oxygen administration. VO2 increased from 0.329 +/- 0.065 to 0.436 +/- 0.109 L/minute (p = 0.029) at rest and from 0.776 +/- 0.275 to 1.119 +/- 0.482 L/minute (p = 0.048) during exercise. Three of these five patients had an arterial oxygen pressure greater than 55 mm Hg at rest. Seven patients had little or no increase in exercise capacity with supplemental oxygen. This patient group had no increase in VO2 at rest. The DO2 failed to increase at rest despite an increase in arterial oxygen content because of a reduction in cardiac output. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that DO2 may fail to increase in some patients with COPD and resting or exertional hypoxemia when supplemental oxygen is administered because of a reduction in cardiac output; that patients who fail to increase their DO2 are less likely to increase exercise capacity; and that some stable, ambulatory patients with COPD who do not qualify for supplemental oxygen at rest by current standards may have inadequate DO2 to meet physiologic needs.\r"

  ".U": "90072225\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: Previous studies of the anemia of chronic disease (ACD) have generally begun with patients afflicted with one of the classical underlying diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The clinical spectrum of ACD has not been thoroughly examined. We hypothesized that many patients have an anemia with the characteristics of ACD but do not have one of the infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic disorders usually associated with ACD. We therefore evaluated a series of consecutive, unselected, anemic patients admitted to a county hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients admitted to the medicine ward service of a county hospital were screened for anemia (hematocrit less than 40% in men, less than 37% in women). Additional laboratory data were collected on all anemic patients, except those with active gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolytic disease, or leukemia or multiple myeloma. The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of serum values indicating iron distribution: iron deficiency (serum ferritin less than 10 ng/mL), ACD (serum iron less than 60 micrograms/dL and serum ferritin more than 50 ng/mL), and all others (non-ACD). The hospital records of the patients in the latter two groups were reviewed and their diagnoses recorded. RESULTS: Seven patients with iron deficiency were not considered further. Ninety patients with ACD were compared with 75 patients with non-ACD. The anemia in ACD patients was more severe than most authors describe. The mean hematocrit was 31%, and 20% of patients had hematocrits below 25%. The anemia was usually normocytic (mean red cell volume [MCV] 86 fL), but 21% had an MCV less than 80 fL. The level of saturation of serum iron-binding capacity was quite low in ACD (mean 15%) and was normal in non-ACD (mean 31%). Renal insufficiency was common in both groups; serum creatinine values were more than 2 mg/dL in 31% of patients with ACD and 20% of non-ACD patients. Sixty percent of patients with ACD had a principal diagnosis that fell into the infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic categories commonly associated with ACD. Renal insufficiency was the major diagnosis in 16%, and the principal diagnosis in 24% was a disease not commonly considered to be associated with ACD. In non-ACD patients, the principal diagnosis was an infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic disease in 55%, renal insufficiency in 9%, and another disease in 36%. CONCLUSIONS: When ACD was defined by the abnormalities of iron distribution, which are its most consistent and widely accepted characteristics, the spectrum of associated diseases was much broader than the traditional categories of infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic disorders, and the overlap with non-ACD was large. Until the etiologic and pathogenetic mechanisms of ACD are better understood, a flexible and inclusive view of this disorder seems appropriate.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The use of plasma histamine determinations as a screening tool to distinguish patients with recurrent unexplained anaphylaxis, flushing, or both from those with mastocytosis has never been evaluated. This retrospective study was designed to determine if plasma histamine levels can be used as a screening test. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Values of plasma histamine levels, measured using a sensitive radioenzymatic assay, from 41 patients with mastocytosis, 26 patients with recurrent unexplained anaphylaxis, and 76 normal subjects were statistically analyzed to determine diagnostic usefulness and accuracy. Patients with mastocytosis were subdivided into four smaller groups on the basis of clinical and histopathologic findings: (1) isolated urticaria pigmentosa, (2) indolent systemic mastocytosis, (3) mastocytosis with dysmyelopoiesis, and (4) lymphadenopathic mastocytosis with eosinophilia. RESULTS: The distribution of plasma histamine values among patients with unexplained anaphylaxis strongly resembled that among the normal subjects (p greater than 0.50, Smirnov test), whereas patients with mastocytosis tended to show moderate to marked elevations above the upper limit of normal (617 pg/mL). The geometric mean plasma histamine levels in mastocytosis subgroups 2, 3, and 4 were found to be quite similar (1,085, 1,976, and 1,433 pg/mL; p greater than 0.50, F-test); moreover, each mean level was significantly greater than those of the normal subjects and of patients with unexplained anaphylaxis (p less than 0.01, Scheffe multiple comparison test). Analysis of the 27 sets of plasma histamine values collected on patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis revealed that the earliest value observed fell below 617 pg/mL in eight patients (30%). A similar analysis applied to the two earlier values indicated that both values would fall below 617 pg/mL in 9% of the patients. Data in four patients with mastocytosis demonstrated a diurnal variation in plasma histamine, with the highest values observed in the early morning (approximately 2:00 A.M.) and the lowest values in the afternoon (approximately 2:00 P.M.). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that, on average, patients with mastocytosis have elevated plasma histamine levels, whereas patients with unexplained anaphylaxis have plasma histamine levels within the normal range during asymptomatic periods; that plasma histamine levels in patients with mastocytosis exhibit a diurnal variation; and that plasma histamine determinations alone are not useful to screen patients for mastocytosis.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to clarify the role of eosinophils and mast cells in the small bowel in celiac disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with celiac disease (n = 10) were investigated by perfusion of a closed jejunal segment. The concentrations of certain granule constituents from eosinophils, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and from mast cells/basophils, histamine, were measured and the jejunal secretion rates of these cellular markers were calculated. RESULTS: Compared with findings in healthy control subjects (n = 14), increased secretion rates were observed under basal conditions in patients with histopathologically active celiac disease. Gliadin, administered by perfusion to the jejunal segment, induced a fourfold increase in ECP secretion and a twofold increase of histamine secretion in patients with celiac disease (n = 7), but did not influence the secretion rates of these substances in healthy controls (n = 3). The secretion rate of ECP started to increase 20 minutes after challenge of the perfused segment with gliadin and reached maximum levels 40 minutes later. The secretion rate of histamine started to increase 40 minutes after gliadin administration. Concurrently with these inflammatory events, the secretion of albumin was doubled as a sign of increased mucosal leakage. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that eosinophils and mast cells are both involved in the early gliadin-induced reactions of the small intestine, and suggest that these cells are effector cells participating in the celiac lesion of the mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which oligohydramnios produces lung hypoplasia is not understood. The current theory that extrinsic compression of the fetal thorax causes hypoplasia, either by inhibiting breathing movements or by squeezing out lung liquid, is not supported by observational or experimental data, or by our finding of decreased amniotic pressure around the fetus in oligohydramnios. We hypothesize that lung hypoplasia results from excess loss of lung liquid because of a reduction in amniotic pressure, and hence an increase in the alveolar-amniotic pressure gradient. The magnitude of this increased pressure gradient is calculated to exceed the small standing tracheal pressure; thus low amniotic pressure overcomes the normal laryngeal retentive mechanisms and allows a larger quantity of lung liquid to escape. In the prevention of pulmonary hypoplasia, a role is suggested for the instillation of artificial amniotic fluid to restore normal amniotic pressure.\r"

All infants with meconium-stained amniotic fluid were routinely suctioned with a DeLee apparatus before tracheal intubation and suctioning. The type and presence of meconium in the trachea, neonatal breathing before intubation, and Apgar scores were recorded in the delivery room. Intrapartum fetal monitoring data were collected for 80% (190/238) of the mothers and umbilical artery pH for 74% (177/238) of the newborns. Despite suctioning with a DeLee apparatus and endotracheal suctioning, meconium was present in the trachea in 87/238 (37%) and meconium aspiration syndrome developed in 22 (9.2%). A total of 73% of newborns who had meconium aspiration syndrome were delivered through thick meconium. Thick meconium, the presence of fetal tachycardia, and absence of intrapartum fetal cardiac accelerations identified the fetus at high risk for meconium aspiration syndrome. The presence of these monitoring findings and thick meconium should alert obstetricians to the possibility of a fetus that requires intervention. Low umbilical artery pH, Apgar scores less than 5, and meconium in the trachea further characterized the newborn at high risk for meconium aspiration syndrome. The combination of these findings may best identify the infant delivered through meconium-stained amniotic fluid who requires close observation for meconium aspiration syndrome.\r"

The overall mortality was 55%, and mortality for the fetofetal transfusion group was 70%, whereas a subset of the fetofetal transfusion group, those without weight discordancy, had a mortality rate of 75%. Our findings suggest that traditional reliance on ultrasonographic criteria for diagnosis of fetofetal transfusion will not detect 40% of such cases.

  ".W": "Management of extremely premature infants is controversial because limits of viability are not established. From 1981 to 1987, 175 infants were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at Minneapolis Children's Medical Center with gestational ages less than or equal to 26 weeks and birth weights less than or equal to 750 gm. To assess current prognosis and to analyze trends over time, survival data and developmental characteristics of surviving infants were reviewed. During the study period, antenatal obstetric management was assertive, with liberal indications for tocolysis and expectant management for preterm prolonged membrane rupture, with the goal of delivery of infants in a nonasphyxiated condition. Ninety-one percent of infants were inborn and were managed aggressively after birth with full neonatal support. Survival increased from 21% in 1981-1982 to greater than 50% in 1986-1987 and occurred as early as 23 weeks' gestation. Seventy-one percent of all deaths occurred within 48 hours of birth, and late death (greater than 28 days) was uncommon. At follow-up, 23% of survivors were impaired, a proportion that remained relatively constant during the study period. Improvements in survival were not associated with an increased proportion of impaired infants. Survival with good outcome is attainable at gestational ages and birth weights previously considered nonviable. For obstetricians, neonatologists, and parents, knowledge of such current data can play an important role in making appropriate management decisions for both mother and infant.\r"

The placement and removal were by someone other than the operator. The operator then recorded the number of the Pratt dilator at which resistance was first met. The mean for the Lamicel group was French size 38.5 +/- 6.4. The mean for the Dilapan group was French size 50.4 +/- 9.6. In the Dilapan group there were six patients for whom cervical resistance was never reached. The results indicate a significantly greater dilatation was achieved with Dilapan dilators.

  ".W": "This study was conducted to develop an equation to predict maximal oxygen uptake from exercise time during a standardized treadmill test in women aged 29 to 75 years before and after aerobic training. Treadmill tests were administered to 181 women with measurement of maximal oxygen uptake, and an equation predicting maximal oxygen uptake was derived: maximal oxygen uptake (ml.kg-1.min-1) = 10.34 + 1.29 (exercise time), r = 0.88, standard error of the estimate = 2.1, p less than 0.0001. Thirty-three women were retested after 6 and 12 months of aerobic exercise training. Maximal oxygen uptake was predicted from the equation developed and compared with the measured values at 6 and 12 months. The predicted and measured maximal oxygen uptake values after training were not significantly different. These results indicate that it is possible to predict maximal oxygen uptake for clinical purposes with a single equation from exercise time in untrained and trained women across a wide range of ages.\r"

We have tested the hypothesis that estrogen modulates episodic and rhythmic prolactin release. To this end we studied six postmenopausal women by repetitive venous sampling basally and on days 1, 5, 10, and 30 after intravaginal placement of an estradiol-impregnated polymeric silicone (Silastic) ring. Computerized analysis of episodic prolactin pulsatility revealed that estrogen amplified prolactin pulse amplitude threefold without changing prolactin pulse frequency. Fourier analysis disclosed heightened amplitudes of specific ultradian rhythms, and deconvolution analysis demonstrated a sevenfold increase in the mass of prolactin secreted per pulse with no change in its half-life. We conclude that estradiol selectively augments the amplitude of episodic prolactin pulsatility, amplifies ultradian rhythms, and increases the mass of prolactin released per secretory burst.\r"

A commercially available enzyme immunoassay kit was used to measure the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin in maternal sera from 38 Down syndrome pregnancies and 114 gestational age matched controls. The human chorionic gonadotropin levels were also assayed in 236 normal sera and plasma samples to determine normative values and appropriate individual corrections. Serum and plasma human chorionic gonadotropin levels are closely correlated and are stable at room temperature, during refrigeration, and throughout freeze-thaw cycles. There is no correlation between the human chorionic gonadotropin level and maternal age, weight, or race. However, the human chorionic gonadotropin level decreases with each week of gestation from 15 to 19 weeks. Medians for each week of gestation were established to account for this variable. Up to 63% of the Down syndrome pregnancies were detected with a cutoff of 2.0 multiples of the normal median. A computational combination of human chorionic gonadotropin and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein testing will detect additional Down syndrome pregnancies and decrease the false-positive rate. The measurement of human chorionic gonadotropin appears to be a valuable addition to maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening programs that can significantly increase the proportion of Down syndrome cases diagnosed.\r"

The femur lengths of affected fetuses have been observed to be shorter than normal, with a ratio of actual to expected femur length of less than 0.91 indicating a high risk of trisomy. To further evaluate this finding we have determined the relationship between limb lengths and gestational age in 37 postmortem fetal specimens with trisomy 21. Control values were obtained from 174 normal fetuses. Measurements of the femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, radius, and ulna were made from roentgenograms or by direct measurement of the bone. Most measurements for each bone of the affected fetuses fell below the normal regression line for that bone, but only 3/37 femurs, 4/32 tibias, 5/32 fibulas, 9/32 humeri, 10/32 radii, and 7/32 ulnas fell more than 2 SDs below the mean. The ratios of actual to expected femur lengths were computed and six fetuses with Down syndrome (16.2%) had ratios less than 0.91. The bones of the extremities of fetuses with trisomy 21 are shorter than normal, but the differences are relatively small. The ratio of actual/expected femur lengths was a less efficient predictor of Down syndrome than were either maternal age or maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein tests. The upper extremity bones were shorter than normal more often than were the bones of the lower extremity, and this finding should be explored further in a prospective study.\r"

Adverse outcomes examined were the incidences of (1) congenital anomalies, (2) stillborn infants, (3) infants dead at 168 hours, and (4) infants with very low and low birth weights. There were 5405 operations in the population of 720,000 pregnant women (operation rate, 0.75%). The incidences of congenital malformations and stillbirths were not increased in the offspring of women having an operation. However, the incidences of very-low- and low-birth-weight-infants were increased; these were the result of both prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation. The incidence of infants born alive but dying within 168 hours also was increased. No specific types of anesthesia or operation were associated with increased incidences of adverse reproductive outcomes. The cause of these outcomes was not determined.\r"

We have summarized our experience with 144 cases of cervical cancer diagnosed during 25 years in South Israel. In recent years a remarkable, although not statistically significant, increase in the number of patients with cervical cancer could be observed. Only two of ten patients were diagnosed at preinvasive stage. In contrast with previous reports we did not find women of Asian and African origin to be overrepresented, but patients from these origins were more often diagnosed at a higher stage than were patients of European origin. Adenocarcinoma accounts for almost 19% of the cervical cancer in premenopausal women. A very low rate of early detection of cervical cancer and a trend of rising incidence of cervical cancer in Jewish women urgently require a reevaluation of health care policy. Large-scale screening programs, perhaps initially in defined high-risk groups are needed.\r"

  ".W": "Despite intense study preeclampsia remains enigmatic and a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Most investigative efforts have focused on the hypertensive component of this disorder with reduced attention given to other equally important characteristics. Increased sensitivity to pressor agents and activation of the coagulation cascade occur early in the course of preeclampsia, often antedating clinically recognizable disease. Inasmuch as endothelial cell injury reduces the synthesis of vasorelaxing agents, increases the production of vasoconstrictors, impairs synthesis of endogenous anticoagulants, and increases procoagulant production, these cells are likely to be implicated in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Indeed, evidence of endothelial cell injury is provided by the most characteristic morphologic lesion of preeclampsia, glomerular endotheliosis. Additional support for this hypothesis is derived from reports that indicate increased levels of circulating fibronectin (which can be released from injured endothelial cells) and increased factor VIII antigen present in the blood of preeclamptic women. More recently, direct evidence of activities that injure endothelial cells in vitro and increase the contractile sensitivity of isolated vessels has been presented. We propose that poorly perfused placental tissue releases a factor(s) into the systemic circulation that injuries endothelial cells. The changes initiated by endothelial cell injury set in motion a dysfunctional cascade of coagulation, vasoconstriction, and intravascular fluid redistribution that results in the clinical syndrome of preeclampsia.\r"

In 163 women preoperative serum levels of CA 125 (p = 0.13) gave no additional information with regard to the relationship of survival prognosis to histologic grade (p = 0.04) and to the diameter of residual tumor mass (p = 0.03). In 132 patients serum CA 125 levels were also determined 3 months after surgery and reflected the effectiveness of the first two cycles of postoperative cytotoxic treatment. At that time CA 125 was the strongest independent prognostic factor for survival (p = 0.0006 Cox model), as compared with histologic grade (p = 0.06), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (p = 0.15), and diameter of residual tumor mass (p = 0.66). Therefore, we concluded that serum CA 125 levels determined 3 months after surgery can identify a high-risk population among patients with epithelial ovarian carcinomas for whom a more aggressive or more intensive treatment might be beneficial.\r"

In the appropriate-for-gestational-age group fetal levels were significantly correlated with but were higher than the maternal levels, which indicates that amino acids are actively transported by the placenta. In the small-for-gestational-age group, the fetal plasma concentration and the fetomaternal ratio of essential amino acids was decreased and this decrease was significantly correlated with the degree of fetal hypoxemia. There was a variable response (e.g., alanine was increased, whereas serine and tyrosine were decreased) involved with nonessential amino acids. In umbilical venous hypoxemia the plasma ratio of nonessential/essential amino acids was increased, and the maternal plasma concentrations of both essential and nonessential amino acids were increased. These findings suggest that in uteroplacental insufficiency there is intrauterine starvation.\r"

Mood was assessed with the Hamilton Depression Scale and an addendum that evaluated fatigue, sociability, appetite, and carbohydrate craving. Calorie and nutrient intakes were measured directly. The subjects with premenstrual syndrome significantly increased calorie intake during the late luteal phase (from 1892 +/- 104 to 2395 +/- 93 kcal, mean +/- SEM); carbohydrate intake increased by 24% from meals and by 43% from snacks. Protein intake failed to change, whereas intake of fat, a fixed constituent of all of the test foods, rose in proportion to calorie intake. The Hamilton Depression Scale and addendum scores rose from 2.0 +/- 0.5 to 21.2 +/- 0.8 (Hamilton Scale) and from 0.5 +/- 0.5 to 10.2 +/- 0.6 (addendum) among subjects with premenstrual syndrome during the luteal phase but failed to change among the controls (2.1 +/- 0.8 to 2.4 +/- 0.8, and 0.4 +/- 0.3 to 0.6 +/- 0.3). Consumption of a carbohydrate-rich, protein-poor evening test meal during the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle improved depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, fatigue, alertness, and calmness scores (p less than 0.01) among patients with premenstrual syndrome. No effect of the meal was observed during the follicular phase or among the control subjects during either phase. Because synthesis of brain serotonin, which is known to be involved in mood and appetite, increases after carbohydrate intake, premenstrual syndrome subjects may overconsume carbohydrates in an attempt to improve their dysphoric mood state.\r"

Among the 63 human immunodeficiency virus-negative women, levels of CD4+ (helper) cells fell to a nadir at 8 weeks before delivery and rose rapidly just before delivery. The level of CD8+ (cytotoxic/suppressor) cells rose slowly from midpregnancy to delivery. Among the 37 human immunodeficiency virus-positive pregnant women, levels of CD4+ cells fell during pregnancy (except for a transient weak increase just before delivery) and did not recover in the postpartum period. Levels of CD8+ cells were consistently higher in human immunodeficiency virus-positive than human immunodeficiency virus-negative women. Post partum the CD8+ cells in human immunodeficiency virus-negative women stabilized at delivery levels, whereas they increased greatly in human immunodeficiency virus-positive women. The loss of CD4+ cells in human immunodeficiency virus-positive women appeared to be faster during pregnancy than in the postpartum period. These data support the hypothesis that pregnancy may accelerate human immunodeficiency virus-induced depletion of CD4+ cells and increase the risk of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

Mean survival time (time from recurrence or, in advanced stages, from the time of diagnosis to death or last follow-up), mean total survival time (time from diagnosis to death or last follow-up), and mean time to recurrence (time from diagnosis of primary tumor to the time of recurrence) were positively correlated with positive progesterone and estrogen receptor status and with histologic grade of tumor. No correlation was found with age, clinical stage, depth of myometrial invasion, or site of metastasis. However, when multiple variables were considered with the Cox regression model, the combination most highly correlated with survival included progesterone receptor, grade of tumor, and site of metastasis (pelvis vs. other sites). All differences were statistically significant (p less than 0.05). We conclude that measurement of progesterone and estrogen receptors in metastatic or recurrent endometrial tumors may be used as an additional prognostic variable.\r"

We used immunohistochemical techniques to quantitate expression of TAG-72, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor in 21 normal endometria and 44 endometrial adenocarcinomas. In normal cycling endometrial glands, TAG-72 expression was related inversely to expression of receptors for estrogen and progesterone. This suggests that TAG-72 expression in normal endometrium may be hormonally regulated. Ninety-one percent of endometrial adenocarcinomas expressed immunohistochemically detectable TAG-72. The magnitude of TAG-72 expression did not correlate with other known prognostic factors in endometrial cancer such as histologic grade, depth of myometrial invasion, surgical stage, or steroid receptor status. The production of TAG-72 by most endometrial adenocarcinomas may represent nonspecific expression by cells that have dedifferentiated.\r"

Cardiac chamber size and ventricular function were investigated by M-mode echocardiography. The hemodynamic results were compared with those of 13 women with singleton pregnancies. Mean Doppler cardiac output was increased at 20 weeks of twin pregnancy (7.63 L/min) and showed no significant change during the remainder of pregnancy, but fell to 5.07 L/min after delivery. This increase was significantly greater than that recorded during singleton pregnancy, because of a relatively greater increase in heart rate. Twin pregnancy was associated with a significantly greater increase in left atrial dimension, but the increases in left ventricular dimensions, wall thickness, and function were comparable to those recorded in singleton pregnancy.\r"

A total of 69 (88%) of the pregnancies occurred after treatment with ovulation-induction agents. The most common complication of pregnancy was premature contractions. Elective cervical cerclage neither prolonged gestation nor decreased fetal loss. The mean gestational age at delivery was 33.2 weeks + 3.8 weeks and 86% of the patients were delivered of premature infants. The perinatal and neonatal mortality rates were 93/1000 and 51/1000, respectively. Our results show a higher proportion of low Apgar scores and respiratory disorders in the third vaginally delivered infants. Follow-up of very low birth weight infants revealed four infants (10.5%) with severe neurologic handicaps. Results of this study suggest that cesarean section is the preferred mode of delivery in triplet pregnancies. Maternal, fetal, and neonatal risks of triplet gestations are relatively low and compare favorably with recent reports on twin pregnancies.\r"

Sperm was prepared by the swim-up method before insemination of oocytes obtained by laparoscopy after ovulation induction. Routine semen analysis and the hypoosmotic swelling test for assessment of sperm membrane integrity were performed on aliquots of prepared sperm. Logistic regression and receiver-operator characteristic curve analyses were performed to determine the overall best-fitting model and discriminatory level of variables that would predict cleavage. The results indicate that after the swim-up procedure, at least 10 million sperm/ml, capable of undergoing swelling in hypoosmotic medium, are necessary to increase the likelihood of in vitro fertilization and cleavage.\r"

The transcervical approach was the only procedure used in the first 330 cases, at which time the transabdominal technique was incorporated into our program. After an initial learning curve in the first 100 procedures the transcervical fetal loss rate stabilized at 2.7%, the number of patients requiring more than one catheter insertion decreased to 11%, and tissue weights greater than or equal to 10 mg were obtained in 88% of cases. The fetal loss rate for transabdominal chorionic villus sampling was 2.6%, indicating the addition of this new method did not significantly alter the fetal loss rate. Transabdominal chorionic villus sampling had an overall success rate of 99%, with only one insertion of the guide needle required for 98% of patients. Tissue weights of greater than or equal to 10 mg were obtained in 99% of cases. These results demonstrate that the transabdominal procedure can be rapidly and effectively incorporated by an operator already experienced with transcervical chorionic villus sampling. Since several contraindications exist for either chorionic villus sampling method, the availability of both techniques at a single center greatly enhances the ability to offer first-trimester fetal diagnosis to a majority of patients.\r"

Its use has been strongly criticized, in that it acts peripherally with no central effect and maternal and neonatal complications are well known. Phenytoin, the mechanism of action of which is clear, seems a logical alternative. Our aim was to develop a safe, practical, effective regimen with the use of phenytoin. In this prospective, descriptive study four dosage regimens were investigated in 104 patients. The initial regimens produced unexpected and unacceptable side effects in comparison with the nonpregnant population. The final regimen (15 mg/kg intravenously, given as 10 mg/kg initially then 5 mg/kg 2 hours later) provided therapeutic levels and had minimal maternal and perinatal side effects. No seizures occurred after its correct usage. This regimen is simple, safe, effective, and provides ongoing anticonvulsant coverage in the postpartum period. We suggest that phenytoin may represent a suitable alternative anticonvulsant in this condition.\r"

Seventy-five percent of the ewes (12 of 16) developed clinical signs of ovine pregnancy-induced hypertension, including maternal hypertension and fetal depression. In three untreated hypertensive ewes, pregnancy was terminated by spontaneous premature delivery, and one maternal death occurred after an eclamptic seizure. All nine ewes treated with one of the two thromboxane synthetase inhibitors responded to therapy with decreases in blood pressure and resolution of fetal depression. These nine ewes completed gestation, and were delivered at term. These data indicate that therapy with thromboxane synthetase inhibitors in this animal model of preeclampsia results in profoundly beneficial effects and suggest that further studies of thromboxane synthetase inhibitors are warranted in preeclampsia.\r"

This effect, which began after 6 hours, was maximal after 24 hours of incubation. In addition, the number of osteoblast-like and fibroblast-like cells increased above control levels after 1, 3, and 5 days of incubation. The above effects were dose-dependent, and maximal stimulation of uterine extracts was comparable with the stimulation achieved by 10% fetal bovine serum. The degree of stimulation by uterine extracts, expressed as percent above controls, was not dependent on the concentration of fetal bovine serum in cell culture medium. The above results are consistent with the view that uterine extracts contain mitogen(s) for bone cells and fibroblasts. These mitogens could play an important role in bone physiology and uterine pathophysiology.\r"

Both herb and extract have been used in the treatment of anginal pain and stroke. Animal studies in the West have shown that tetramethylpyrazine improves coronary blood flow, is short acting, and has a low toxicity. There are no clinical or animal studies on the uterine effects of tetramethylpyrazine. We present results of a preliminary study with isolated uterine strips from rats. We found that tetramethylpyrazine, in a dose-dependent manner (0.6 to 20 micrograms/ml), reduced uterine diastolic tone and inhibited the response to oxytocin (0.02 to 0.32 micrograms/ml). Higher concentrations of tetramethylpyrazine were needed to block the uterine responses to prostaglandin E2 (0.01 to 0.1 microgram/ml). On the basis of clinical and folk experience in the Far East, tetramethylpyrazine appears to have fewer systemic effects in human beings than have the beta-adrenergic agonists or calcium channel blockers. We suggest that studies in the whole animal and in the clinic might provide reasons to use tetramethylpyrazine to reduce uterine contractions and tone in pregnant women at term.\r"

Platelet counts fell precipitately in controls and rose after magnesium infusions. Fetal heart rates rose in controls at 5-minute intervals and were unchanged in magnesium-treated mothers. Because of disparity of the baseline mean arterial pressure, direct comparisons were not significant before and after cocaine. Alterations from the baseline were different in magnesium-treated versus control animals, with values in the latter rising by 28 +/- 10 mm Hg with lactated Ringer's solution plus cocaine and falling by 3 +/- 5 mm Hg with magnesium pretreatment. Values in test animals originally treated with magnesium rose 4 +/- 11 mm Hg for an overall significance of p less than 0.05.

Cerebral flood flow was measured with radiolabeled microspheres. On average, 45% +/- 3% (SEM) reductions in perfusion pressure were accompanied by 49% +/- 4% decreases in cerebral blood flow. Increases in perfusion pressure of 42% +/- 3% were associated with 45% +/- 7% increments in cerebral flood flow. The cerebral oxygen consumption was not significantly altered in either case. We also investigated the effect of pentobarbital on fetal cerebral oxygen consumption and cerebral blood flow at normal and at altered perfusion pressure. At normal perfusion pressure pentobarbital caused a 27% +/- 5% decrease in cerebral oxygen consumption that was associated with a 44% +/- 4% decrement in cerebral blood flow and a slight widening of the arteriovenous oxygen content gradient. In this hypometabolic cerebral state, alterations in perfusion pressure were again accompanied by proportional changes in cerebral blood flow. Both perfusion pressure and the cerebral oxygen consumption appear to be important determinants of fetal cerebral blood flow.\r"

Prostaglandins are potent uterine constrictors. 5-HETE and LTC4 also stimulate uterine contractions but their role in labor is not known. To estimate the activities of these pathways before parturition and their relationship to uterine contractility, amniotic fluid concentrations of 5-HETE, LTC4, and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) were determined in five chronically catheterized rhesus monkeys. Uterine contractility was continually assessed by recording changes in amniotic fluid pressure. The results obtained indicate the following conclusions: (1) 5-HETE and LTC4, but not PGF2 alpha, are associated with uterine contractility after preterm intrauterine surgery. Surprisingly, amniotic fluid PGF2 alpha, levels were nondetectable for 1 to 2 weeks after surgery. (2) 5-HETE and LTC4 are present in higher concentrations than PGF2 alpha in amniotic fluid. (3) 5-HETE, LTC4, and PGF2 alpha all increase with the onset of labor. Amniotic fluid concentrations of 5-HETE and LTC4 are significantly higher than those of PGF2 alpha before and during term and preterm labor. (4) Labor can occur with suppressed PGF2 alpha levels but with increasing 5-HETE and LTC4 levels. (5) These data suggest that 5-HETE and LTC4 are important components of the parturitional process.\r"

Experiments were done with an in vitro ovarian perfusion system to investigate whether indomethacin affects luteinization and steroidogenesis. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg) was administered in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (100 IU) via a marginal ear vein, and a second dose of indomethacin was given 8 hours later. Control animals received vehicle in place of indomethacin. Laparotomy was performed 24 hours after the initial treatment. The presence of unruptured follicles and corpora lutea was recorded and the ovaries were perfused in vitro for 3 hours. Progesterone, prostaglandin F2 alpha, prostaglandin E2, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha were measured in samples obtained at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes from the circulating perfusion medium entering and exiting the ovary. At the end of the perfusion all ovaries (12 treated and 10 controls) were fixed for histologic analysis. Ovulation occurred in all control ovaries but in none of the indomethacin-treated ovaries. The mean number of unruptured follicles per ovary in the treated group was not significantly different from the number of corpora lutea plus unruptured follicles per ovary in the controls. Cells in both groups were qualitatively similar in ultrastructure; abundant lipid droplets, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria were seen. Secretion rates of progesterone and prostaglandin did not differ between the two groups during the 3-hour perfusion period. These results suggest that transformation of granulosa cells into fully functional luteal cells can occur in the absence of follicular rupture.\r"

  ".W": "Fifteen transfusions were performed in normal or anemic chronically catheterized sheep fetuses ranging in weight from 0.73 to 3.62 kg and in age from 91 to 135 days' gestation (term = 147 days). During the transfusions, an average of 29.0 +/- 2.5 (SE) ml/kg of packed maternal red blood cells (hematocrit = 78%) were given intravenously over 30 minutes and fetal hematocrit increased from 28.5% +/- 1.2% to 43.8% +/- 1.6%. Circulating blood volume increased by 13.9 +/- 2.3 ml/kg at 1 hour after transfusion and remained at this level at 24 hours. An average of 15.1 +/- 2.4 ml/kg of plasma was lost from the circulation at 1 hour after the transfusion. Fetal vascular pressures increased significantly during the transfusions and the rise in arterial pressure was greater than that in venous pressure (p less than 10(-6]. Heart rate decreased by 23 beats/min at the end of the transfusion and remained 13 beats/min below control after 1 hour (p less than 10(-6]. From the measured blood volume changes, formulas were developed so that the fetal blood volume before the transfusion and the posttransfusion hematocrit could be accurately calculated (r greater than 0.90). Thus this study shows that packed cell transfusions increase fetal blood volume by only 50% of the transfused volume because of a loss of plasma from the circulation and that the pretransfusion blood volume and the posttransfusion hematocrit can be accurately calculated from readily measured variables.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 14 million American women currently use oral contraceptives. This represents only 32% of those at risk for pregnancy. Many studies suggest that bleeding irregularities are a primary reason for discontinuation of oral contraceptives, especially among adolescents. The Triphasic Randomized Clinical Trial study and several others suggest that intermenstrual bleeding may be experienced by at least one third of women taking oral contraceptives at one time or another. The socioeconomic costs of these episodes, realized in calls and visits to physicians, as well as pill discontinuation, pregnancy, and perhaps abortion, carry their own unique set of risks. Absence of withdrawal bleeding, or amenorrhea, is another concern because, to the woman, it signals pregnancy. Roughly two thirds of patients who have amenorrhea while taking oral contraceptives will consult a physician. Physicians should select oral contraceptives with the lowest doses of hormones and fewest side effects such as breakthrough bleeding or amenorrhea, which are major obstacles to compliance.\r"

The average clinician assigned 66% of the criteria to the actual parent categories. These results suggest that the face validity of many of the DSM-III-R personality disorder criteria is low. Moreover, it appears that there are high levels of overlap in meaning among the criteria for the histrionic/narcissistic, avoidant/dependent, and schizotypal/paranoid pairs of personality disorders.\r"

Further analysis linked molestation history to suicidality, substance abuse, sexual difficulties, multiple psychiatric diagnoses, and axis II traits or disorders--especially borderline personality. Severe abuse and multiple abusers best predicted psychiatric sequelae.\r"

  ".W": "The role of angioscopic monitoring and aiming for control of laser intervention in the vascular system was initially investigated in 48 vessels in 33 dogs, and the techniques were then applied to 30 patients undergoing intraoperative or percutaneous laser-probe angioplasty treatment for long atherosclerotic occlusions of the femoral and popliteal arteries or well-localized lesions of the superficial femoral artery. Experimental bare argon fiber laser application in 20 normal canine arteries in vivo demonstrated that small-diameter laser fibers could be accurately aimed by manipulations of the scope. However, advancement of the fiber resulted universally in perforation, with extravasation and thermal damage of surrounding tissues after 2 seconds of argon laser energy at low power. In 28 canine and 2 human veins, angioscopically guided metallic-tipped laserprobes were used to divide 82 valve cusps in preparation for in-situ bypass, with satisfactory aiming and monitoring achieved expeditiously by manipulations of the angioscope. We conclude that angioscopic aiming of lasers is feasible in normal vessels or localized lesions. In contrast, angioscopy has a restricted role for guidance of laser angioplasty in atherosclerotic, occluded arteries, and does not prevent perforation. Postprocedural inspection allows immediate detection of complications and may avert or predict poor outcome.\r"

Ninety-four percent were performed for limb-threatening ischemia and 6 percent for claudication. Ninety-one bypasses were to tibial vessels in the calf (Group 1), whereas severe disease of the tibial vessels in the calf necessitated bypass to arteries at the ankle and beyond in 24 (Group 2). Life-table analysis was used to calculate limb salvage, graft patency, and functional status for Group 1 and Group 2 36 months postoperatively; there were no statistical differences between groups with regard to these variables (p = 0.38). Diabetes had no impact on the success of reconstruction, and preoperative noninvasive testing was not predictive of graft failure in either group. Significantly, limb salvage closely paralleled graft patency and functional status, illustrating the severe disease in all patients. Patients with severe tibial-peroneal atherosclerosis may benefit from bypass grafting to the pedal arteries with a success rate equal to those done to more proximal sites.\r"

The technique involved excision of the injured or infected artery beyond the margins of the debrided wound and insertion of an autogenous saphenous vein as an extraanatomic bypass graft in a medial or lateral position around the wound. Shotgun wounds were the mechanism of injury in six patients, whereas an extensive injury or infection in the brachial artery was present in eight patients. Successful wound coverage or closure was accomplished and distal arterial flow preserved in 11 patients, 5 of whom had residual neuromuscular or bony defects related to the magnitude of the original injury.\r"

Mean follow-up was 30 +/- 24 months after PTA and 40 +/- 25 months after surgery. The incidences of procedural complications were similar (PTA one complication, surgery two complications). Although better early results were achieved in patients who underwent PTA (actuarial patency: PTA 91 percent, surgery 87 percent), after dilatation, we observed a continuous deterioration of the hemodynamic status of the artery, which led to a high rate of late restenosis (actuarial patency: PTA 54 percent, surgery 87 percent). There were no significant changes postoperatively. The specific role of each procedure is analyzed in view of the new acknowledgment of the clinical importance of proximal subclavian artery disease.\r"

Bone changes compatible with osteitis were present on 15 of 32 foot radiographs (47 percent) and on 16 of 25 bone scans (64 percent). Bacterial growth was present in 27 of 32 wounds (84 percent) and 23 of 32 bone cultures (72 percent). Twelve of 23 patients (52 percent) with positive bone cultures had evidence of bone destruction and periosteal reaction on radiographs. The remaining 11 of 23 patients (48 percent) without radiographic signs of osteitis had bacterial growth from their bone cultures. Bone scans were positive in 12 of 18 patients (67 percent) with positive bone cultures and negative in 6 of 18 positive bone cultures (33 percent). We conclude that neither foot radiographs, technetium-99m bone scans, nor wound cultures should be used as the sole criterion for determining the use of antibiotic therapy or amputation in diabetic patients with foot ulcers.\r"

The overall mortality was 19 percent; 83 percent died within the first 24 hours from exsanguination or severe head injury. Although no single procedure uniformly applies to the combined pancreatoduodenal trauma, active sump drainage of the pancreas, pyloric exclusion of the duodenum, and early nutritional support through needle catheter jejunostomy are the mainstay treatment principles.\r"

Thirty-eight children (20 percent) had a second radiograph and 8 patients had a third study, all of which showed no injury. There was only one fracture seen during the 2 1/2-year time period. Of the 16 children admitted over the 20-year period, only 3 sustained an injury below the fourth cervical vertebra (C4), and all were over 8 years of age. All patients with cervical spine injury were either comatose or had symptoms referable to the neck. We conclude that the routine cervical spine radiograph in pediatric trauma is a very low-yield test.\r"

The typical patient was a young man who sustained multiple injuries from motor vehicle or recreational accidents. Twenty-one patients had 27 major complications, and 2 died. Many small communities cannot afford helicopter-based trauma systems. Conversely, however, distance and geographic barriers limit access to designated centers. Accordingly, rural surgeons cannot opt out of trauma care and must look to trauma surgeons to help in solving access problems.\r"

Only 22 percent of the malpractice claims were found in Level I facilities, whereas 58 percent were found in other hospitals and 20 percent came from outpatient facilities. Not surprisingly, the indemnity awards were more than two times higher in other hospitals than in Level I hospitals. However, the legal dollars spent in defense per claim were two times higher in Level I than either outpatient hospitals or outpatient treatment facilities, suggesting that Level I malpractice claims are more defensible. We have identified six areas of high potential liability and have made some suggestions for the reduction of risk management in those areas.\r"

During a 3-year period, 280 patients sustaining blunt chest trauma were admitted to the surgical intensive care unit to exclude myocardial contusion. Patients were evaluated by electrocardiogram and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) MB enzyme levels every 8 hours for a minimum of 48 hours. Myocardial contusion was identified in 35 patients (13 percent); the diagnosis was established by transient electrocardiographic changes (30), CPK-MB more than 3 percent (9) or both criteria (4). Two patients (1 percent) died from cardiac decompensation 4 and 12 hours postinjury, and seven (3 percent) required early (12 hours postinjury) intensive care unit treatment of arrhythmias or myocardial failure. None of the remaining 271 patients developed cardiac symptoms. This clinical experience underscores the low incidence of cardiac sequelae among patients at risk for myocardial contusion. Complications were always manifest within 12 hours of injury. The clinical diagnosis of myocardial contusion can be excluded pragmatically in the asymptomatic patient with a normal electrocardiogram and CPK-MB levels during the initial 24-hour postinjury period.\r"

Thirty-two patients with a radiologically demonstrated Schatzki's ring were compared with 32 patients with hiatal hernia and no Schatzki's ring. Schatzki's ring was confirmed on endoscopy in 59 percent of patients. Seventy-five percent of patients with Schatzki's ring presented with dysphagia compared with 41 percent of control patients (p less than 0.01). Heartburn and regurgitation were less frequent than in control subjects (38 percent versus 91 percent, p less than 0.0001). Schatzki's ring patients were found to have a lower incidence of proven gastroesophageal reflux on 24-hour pH monitoring. Those with proven reflux were found to have a more efficient lower esophageal sphincter than control patients. Sixty-two percent of Schatzki's ring patients without proven reflux had a history of chronic ingestion of drugs known to be damaging to the esophageal mucosa, whereas only 26 percent of patients with reflux had this history. This was found in 16 percent of controls. Sixty-two percent of Schatzki's ring patients without reflux responded to a single dilatation compared with 37 percent of those with reflux. These findings suggest an etiologic relationship between pill lodgement and Schatzki's ring in patients without reflux and indicate that different therapy should be employed in these patients.\r"

To examine the complications to the fetus and mother and the consequences of a delay in operative intervention, we retrospectively studied all pregnant patients over a 17-year period who had undergone abdominal surgery at one institution. A total of 92 abdominal operations were performed on 90 patients. During the same period, 41,532 deliveries occurred. One in 451 deliveries involved surgical procedures during pregnancy. Thirty-seven patients had surgery for acute appendicitis; 20 patients were operated on for ovarian abnormalities. Postoperatively, there were two maternal deaths: one from cardiac arrhythmia and the other from hepatic failure. The most common postoperative complication was premature labor (19 patients, 21 percent). In 16 of these patients, early tocolysis was begun without fetal loss. There were five fetal deaths. Forty-seven of 72 patients had term deliveries. Intraabdominal surgery during pregnancy carries an acceptable risk to the mother and fetus; complications are related to disease severity and operative delay rather than to the operative procedure itself.\r"

One hundred patients were treated medically without surgical intervention, and 34 patients underwent operation after medical therapy failed. Significant risk factors in patients requiring operative therapy included smoking (p = 0.03), multiple trauma and sepsis (p = 0.02), large ulcers (p = 0.03), and multiple ulcers (p = 0.02). We have identified a set of factors associated with a high risk of failure of medical therapy. Patients with any of these risk factors may be treated most effectively by a limited trial of medical therapy with close follow-up. If their ulcer disease does not respond readily to standard medical therapy, they should be considered for early elective surgery.\r"

The proportion of continent patients increased from 36 percent preoperatively to 74 percent postoperatively. Constipation increased after suture rectopexy but was managed conservatively. We believe that simple suture rectopexy offers a safe and effective alternative to other, more complex procedures for the treatment of rectal prolapse.\r"

  ".W": "Eight of 17 patients with necrotizing pancreatitis (47 percent) developed 12 intestinal fistulas. Pancreatitis occurred most often secondary to alcohol abuse, and fistula complicated controlled open drainage of the lesser sac more often than sump or Penrose drainage of the lesser sac. Fistulas appeared more often in patients with two or more drainage operations than in those with a single drainage procedure. Most duodenal fistulas closed with nonoperative therapy, whereas jejunal and colonic fistulas required operative closure. Operative techniques included both simple suture closure and resection with anastomosis. Five patients (29 percent) died. Thus, although frequent debridement and controlled open drainage may reduce the mortality rate of necrotizing pancreatitis, it appears to increase the likelihood of intestinal fistulas, which may require operative treatment.\r"

Of the 21 patients who survived pancreaticoduodenectomy, 4 had tumor confined to the ampulla, 7 had tumor extending into the duodenum, and 10 had tumor invasion beyond the duodenum. Nine of these patients had positive lymph nodes and 12 had negative lymph nodes. The patient who had local excision was disease-free at last follow-up 104 months postoperatively. Each of the three bypassed patients died of tumor progression within 15 months. The estimated 5-year survival rate for resected patients was 60 percent and was independently related to lymph node metastases (p = 0.031) and to tumor size (p = 0.039). This experience suggests that long-term survival is possible in patients with lymph node metastases or invasive tumors extending beyond the duodenal wall and that curative pancreaticoduodenectomy can be performed with a low operative mortality; therefore, aggressive surgical resection is recommended for all patients with ampullary carcinoma.\r"

Seventy-five percent of patients experienced relief of symptoms referable to their ascites. The mean survival time post-shunt placement was 33 weeks; however, considerable variation was noted in survival times for the various tumor types (pancreas 7 weeks, ovary 71 weeks). Significant alterations in coagulation parameters consistent with subclinical disseminated intervascular coagulation (DIC) were present in all patients with functioning shunts. These coagulation changes have proven reliable indicators of shunt patency. Shunt revision was necessary in 18 percent of patients. No significant difference in shunt patency was detected when Denver and LeVeen shunts were compared. This experience indicates that PVS offers effective palliation without undue morbidity for malignant ascites. The best results can be expected in those patients with ovarian and breast primary tumors. Because of the short time from onset of disabling ascites until death, PVS is not indicated in the majority of patients with pancreatic cancer.\r"

Operative mortality was 4 percent (1 of 27), and postoperative morbidity occurred in 48 percent of the patients. Twenty-five of 26 patients were tolerating solid food at the time of discharge; 21 were able to maintain oral alimentation until just prior to their death. Median survival following the operation was 15 months (range: 2 to 110 months), with a 62 percent absolute 1-year survival rate and a 38 percent 2-year survival rate. On the basis of these results, we conclude that in patients with advanced gastric carcinoma, total gastrectomy with Roux-Y esophagojejunostomy can be performed with an acceptable morbidity and mortality, provides significant palliation by restoring the patient's ability to eat, and should be performed when technically feasible, even in the presence of gross residual disease.\r"

Twenty-one patients had serologic conversion: 3 with primary CMV infections, 18 with reactivation of CMV infection (CMV group). Twenty-two patients had no serologic conversion (no CMV group). To differentiate the effects of CMV and transfusion, the CMV group and the no CMV group were each divided into high (more than 10 units) and low (less than 10 units) transfusion subgroups. Similar fever peaks, leukocyte counts, lymphocyte counts, and incidence of major bacterial sepsis were recorded for the four subgroups. Several factors were significantly associated with CMV infection independent of transfusion, including increased duration of major bacterial sepsis and number of septic episodes per patient; prolonged duration of anergy; increased duration of intensive care unit and hospital stay; increased duration of ventilatory assistance and rate of tracheostomy; and increased suppressor cells, decreased helper: suppressor ratios, increased functional suppressor cells, and increased natural killer cells. Although mortality was not increased with CMV infection, our data suggest that such infection after trauma may delay recovery from major bacterial infection, often resulting in a major increase in morbidity.\r"

In 8 of 10 cases, the diagnosis was based on abdominal computed tomography scan. Seven of 10 patients were treated with splenectomy, and 3 were managed with computed tomography-guided drainage. Abscess cultures included Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis. There were two morbidities and one death in the splenectomy group and no complications in those treated with percutaneous drainage. This review suggests a flexible approach in the management of splenic abscess. Although splenectomy remains the traditional treatment for bacterial splenic abscess, CT-guided drainage may be appropriate in carefully selected patients.\r"

To study the role of endoscopic screening in cases of inguinal hernia, we prospectively evaluated 464 patients with inguinal hernia over a 54-month period with flexible sigmoidoscopy. Each patient was over the age of 40 and male. Sigmoidoscopy documented polyps (97 patients, 21 percent) and carcinoma (22 patients, 5 percent). Multiple neoplasms were observed in 6 percent (7 of 119 patients). Occult blood was detected in the fecal specimens of 8 percent of the total group of patients, but in only 13 percent of the patients with polyps or carcinomas. A normal examination occurred in only 38 percent of the total group. By using the presence of an inguinal hernia in patients older than 40 years of age as an indication for sigmoidoscopy, we found that more than one of every four patients had an asymptomatic, concurrent malignant or premalignant colonic lesion. Flexible sigmoidoscopy should be used for screening colonic neoplasms in patients with inguinal hernia.\r"

Symptoms included fever, cough, tube drainage postoperatively, anorexia, weight loss, chest pain, tachypnea, and lymphadenitis. Multiple aerobic and anaerobic organisms were cultured. Treatment included thoracentesis and antibiotics, tube thoracostomy, tube thoracostomy and bronchoscopy, decortication, or decortication with lobectomy. The total hospital stay averaged 28.3 days, and after decortication, 11.6 days. Empyemas in children frequently have multiple organisms and should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics while awaiting culture results. Thoracentesis and tube thoracostomy are often ineffective in curing the disease. Decortication can abbreviate hospital stay if performed promptly for persistent pleural sepsis.\r"

There was no foreign body found at bronchoscopy in seven patients (9 percent), and there were nine patients (12 percent) with bronchial foreign bodies who had a delay in diagnosis of foreign body aspiration. The delay averaged 35 days. These children, as a result of a prolonged period before diagnosis, were treated unnecessarily for pneumonia and asthma. Once correctly diagnosed, they had a significantly longer hospital stay. We propose that some negative bronchoscopies are necessary in order to prevent the morbidity that occurs from a missed foreign body aspiration.\r"

A protocol for synchronous renal and segmental pancreatic transplantation, utilizing pancreaticocystostomy, was initiated in February 1985, and through December 1988, 44 patients (mean age 34.8 years) received dual allografts. At last follow-up, 25 patients had functioning kidneys, and 17 patients were insulin independent 4 to 50 months after transplantation, with a mean fasting blood glucose level of 86 mg/100 ml. As our experience increased, three factors were identified as reducing pancreatic allograft and patient survival: vascular thrombosis, inadequate control of pancreatic secretions, and coronary artery disease. As a result, our protocol was modified to include postoperative heparin, external stenting of the pancreaticocystostomy, and dipyridamole thallium testing to screen for coronary artery disease. With these modifications, technical failures and postoperative morbidity were reduced with a resultant increase in 6-month graft and patient survival. These results provide impetus for considering synchronous renal and pancreatic transplantation as a therapeutic option for type I diabetics with end-stage renal disease.\r"

Safe reversal (recovery to a T4 ratio greater than 0.5), after this dose of atracurium, could only be reliably and rapidly (less than 2 minutes) achieved with edrophonium if a period greater than 30 minutes elapsed since administration of the relaxant. This coincides with the appearance of four recognisable twitches if a train-of-four pattern of nerve stimulation is used. Thus, if no monitoring equipment is available, at least half-an-hour should elapse after administration of atracurium in a moderate dose (e.g. 0.3 mg/kg) before rapid and reliable reversal can be anticipated. Four twitches in a train-of-four should be recognisable, if a nerve stimulator is available.\r"

Postural manoeuvres were performed 5 minutes before and 6, 11 and 16 minutes after enalaprilat or saline. Complete inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme occurred with all doses of enalaprilat, which allowed the four different treatment groups to be considered as one large treated group. The mean arterial pressure was almost unchanged during the postural manoeuvres; the heart rate increased, mostly similarly (by approximately 10%) in both groups. Mean arterial pressure in the recumbent position decreased over the 17 minutes before induction in the enalaprilat group, and increased slightly in the control group (treated mean, -5.0%; controls mean, 1.8%; difference, -6.8%; 95% confidence intervals of difference, -2.3 to -11.3%, p less than 0.01). This difference was again seen after induction (treated, -8.0%; controls, 7.7%; confidence intervals of difference, -0.6 to -31%) and for a 5-minute period shortly after tracheal intubation. The increases in mean arterial pressure produced by intubation itself were similar in both groups (treated, + 36%; controls, + 35%; 95% confidence intervals of difference, -16% to + 18%). Changes in heart rate after induction were also similar in both groups. It is concluded that intravenous enalaprilat acted as a hypotensive agent with a sparing effect on autonomic reflexes, both before and after induction of anaesthesia.\r"

The severity of illness in both groups was assessed using the APACHE II scoring system. The transferred group were scored before and after the journey, while the directly admitted group were scored only on admission. The results show that the transferred patients exhibited a consistent cardiorespiratory response to transport irrespective of their severity of illness, and that the mortality in both groups of patients in the intensive therapy unit was not significantly different. The results also suggest that in the transferred group, the outcome is not only dependent on the severity of illness but also on other factors, such as the hospital from which the patient was referred and the duration of the pretransfer admission.\r"

  ".U": "90072669\r", 
  ".W": "A new single injection procedure, the fascia iliaca compartment block, is described for blocking the femoral, lateral cutaneous, and obturator nerves. The technique consists of injecting a local anesthetic immediately behind the fascia iliaca at the union of the lateral with the two medial thirds of the inguinal ligament, and forcing it upward by finger compression. This block was prospectively evaluated in 60 pediatric patients aged 0.7 to 17 years undergoing surgery of the lower limb, and then compared with a similar group of 60 children given a 3-in-1 block. Adequate analgesia was only obtained in 20% of the patients given 3-in-1 blocks (group 1), whereas the fascia iliaca compartment block proved to be easy, free of complications, and effective in more than 90% of patients (group 2). Such a high failure rate in group 1 was not due to misplacement of the needle since a femoral nerve block developed in all patients. Therefore it is unlikely that the local anesthetic can spread rostrally towards the lumbar plexus then return peripherally along the issuing nerves, and this was, indeed, not confirmed by radiological findings. In the authors' opinion, a multieffective block can only develop when the local anesthetic is introduced behind the fascia iliaca, which circumscribes a potential space where the femoral, lateral cutaneous, and obturator nerves run for a considerable part of their course. This report shows that deliberately injecting this space almost always results in an easy and effective block of these three nerves. The fascia iliaca compartment block can be recommended for use in children.\r"

The present study investigated the hemodynamic, gasometric, and metabolic effects of hypertonic colloids in endotoxic shock in the dog. Thirty minutes after administration of 3 mg/kg normal body weight of Escherichia coli endotoxin, dogs were randomly assigned to receive 10 mL/kg hydroxyethylstarch (HES) either in 0.9% NaCl (HES, 10 dogs) or in 7.5% NaCl (HT-HES, 10 dogs) in 30 min. Thereafter, 0.9% NaCl solution was administered in volumes adequate to maintain pulmonary artery balloon-occluded pressure at baseline levels. Total fluid administered averaged 64 +/- 30 mL/kg (mean +/- SD) in the HES group and 73 +/- 34 mL/kg in the HT-HES group. As these differences were not statistically significant, total sodium load was higher in the HT-HES group. The persistent volume effect was associated with persistently lower hematocrit and protein levels in the HT-HES group. Initial fluid resuscitation with HT-HES resulted in arterial pressure, cardiac filling pressures, cardiac output, stroke volume, and rates of oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption that were greater than those with HES. Vascular resistances were similar. Analysis of left ventricular function curves also indicated an improvement in cardiac performance. However, these effects almost completely vanished during the remainder of the study. In the HT-HES group, serum sodium and osmolality levels increased to 167 +/- 4 mEq/L and 344 +/- 4 mOsm/kg H2O, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A real-time recording system for the detection of surface His-Purkinje potentials based on signal averaging techniques was used. Recordings were made in 23 patients before and after the administration of halothane. In 18 patients we were able to measure atrial (P-H) and His-Purkinje (H-V) conduction times (78%). A small but statistically significant decrease in P-H conduction times from 115.3 +/- 3.9 (SEM) to 110.8 +/- 4.2 ms was found (P less than or equal to 0.01). H-V conduction times did not change significantly. Heart rates decreased significantly from 87.6 +/- 2.6 to 74.8 +/- 2.5 beats/min (P less than or equal to 0.01). Systolic blood pressures decreased from 118.9 +/- 3.7 to 103.6 +/- 4.2 mm Hg. It is concluded that the decrease in heart rate and the decrease in atrial conduction time caused by halothane can be explained by interactions of several different mechanisms. The specific combination of slowing heart rate and a decrease of atrial conduction time provides a possible explanation for atrial arrhythmias during the administration of halothane.\r"

In this study, we used an isolated rabbit right atrial model that reproduces the effects on inotropic and chronotropic functions induced by 0.5 micrograms/mL bupivacaine; then we tried to counteract these events by electrical stimulation or by addition of CaCl2 or adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the bathing solution. Contractile force was dramatically depressed by bupivacaine alone (-68%), even when the preparation was paced (-59%). CaCl2 partially counteracted this decrease (-37%). Inotropic function was almost completely restored (-9%) when ATP was added before administration of bupivacaine. Inhibition of energy metabolism seems to be a major explanation for bupivacaine cardiotoxicity.\r"

The spread of analgesia was equal in the groups, whereas the longest duration was noted in the etidocaine and bupivacaine groups. With use of a method for determining muscle force, motor blockade during anesthesia was recorded quantitatively for hip flexion, knee extension, and plantar flexion of the big toe. Onset of motor blockade was significantly more rapid with etidocaine than with bupivacaine and mepivacaine. All subjects given etidocaine developed complete motor blockade, but with the other local anesthetics 5%-33% of the initial muscle force remained. The least motor blockade was found in the L5-S2 segment (plantar flexion of the big toe). The duration of maximal motor blockade varied between 60 min (mepivacaine) and 360 min (etidocaine). With each of the three local anesthetics, motor function returned simultaneously in the three muscle groups tested. Complete restoration of muscle function occurred significantly later for etidocaine (600 min) than for bupivacaine (360 min) and mepivacaine (180 min). With etidocaine, the motor blockade outlasted the sensory blockade by 150 min. The Bromage scale corresponded to the motor blockade only during the first half of the regression phase. Not until 1-3 h after attainment of Bromage grade 0 was the muscle force of all movements restored (90% of control values).\r"

Anesthetic techniques were identical except for the presence or absence of 1.25 mg of IV droperidol. There were no differences between the groups with regard to postoperative nausea, vomiting, pain, or time to discharge. In 23% of patients given droperidol, anxiety or restlessness developed after discharge from the ambulatory care unit. No patient not receiving droperidol had these reactions. It is suggested that the routine use of droperidol in all outpatients receiving general anesthesia may not be appropriate.\r"

  ".W": "Although many studies have presented data based on administration of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents to patients given inhalation anesthesia for 30-45 min, no data exist on the interaction in a clinical situation where the relaxant is administered immediately after the start of anesthesia. We therefore studied the effect of the commonly used inhalation anesthetics, halothane and enflurane, on the clinical pharmacology of atracurium, vecuronium, pipecuronium, and pancuronium. No significant influence of the anesthetic technique on the onset time of the various neuromuscular blocking agents was observed. The duration of action of atracurium, pipecuronium, and pancuronium was significantly prolonged during enflurane anesthesia as compared with the other two anesthetic techniques. The duration of vecuronium blockade was not significantly influenced by enflurane. Halothane, in contrast to enflurane, did not significantly prolong the blockade induced by these agents. The prolongation of atracurium blockade was clinically irrelevant. A fact that is statistically significant but clinically irrelevant is that a cumulative effect with atracurium and vecuronium was only seen during enflurane anesthesia and after the fourth maintenance dose. We conclude that there is no clinical indication that the dosage of atracurium and vecuronium during inhalation anesthesia should be reduced, but the doses of pipecuronium and pancuronium should be reduced when prolonged paralysis is not desired.\r"

Carotid chemoreceptor activation (CCRA) produced by consecutive injections of nicotine (0.2-0.4 micrograms/kg) through the carotid catheter elicited bradycardia, expressed as an increase in cardiac cycle length by 140% +/- 18%, and a 252% +/- 16% increase in mean iliac arterial vascular resistance. These responses were markedly attenuated by fentanyl in a dose-dependent fashion: cardiac cycle length increased only by 50% +/- 7% (P less than 0.01) with 4 micrograms/kg and by 19% +/- 6% (P less than 0.01) with 8 micrograms/kg of intravenous fentanyl. These changes were paralleled by significantly (P less than 0.01) lesser increases in mean iliac arterial resistance (122% +/- 9% and 50% +/- 5%). It is concluded that fentanyl impairs the integrity of the carotid chemoreceptor reflex.\r"

  ".W": "Most surgical and anesthesia personnel assume that certain factors lead to increased preoperative anxiety, yet the predictability of preoperative anxiety has not been extensively studied. We hypothesized that surgical and anesthesia personnel could be more effective in reducing preoperative anxiety if potential predictors of presurgical anxiety were identified. A sample of 523 patients awaiting elective surgery completed an anxiety scale, had their blood pressure and pulse measured, and had 14 different characteristics recorded. These characteristics included demographics, possibility of cancer, presence of support person, previous surgical experience, and extent of surgery. Female patients were more anxious than male patients, and individuals accompanied by a support person were more anxious than those not accompanied. However, all other factors were noncontributory to anxiety. It appears that patient anxiety does not reflect the assumptions of surgical and anesthesia personnel. This suggests that preoperative anxiety may reflect a patient's personality and coping style more than medical data.\r"

We investigated the direction of dural fibers in posterior L3-4 dura mater obtained from three autopsies and tallied it in three orthogonal planes. Under low-power light microscopy the tissue appeared to be composed of lamellae branching irregularly and directed concentrically to the spinal cord. Electron micrographs (x5000) revealed that the lamellae consisted mainly of bundles of collagen fibers that pursued wavy courses in various directions. The lamellae also contained branching elastic fibers, many of which were directed longitudinally. This arrangement of fibers probably minimizes the tendency of a dural puncture hole to gape under tension if the needle bevel is directed longitudinally.\r"

Adequate blood CYS levels, defined as greater than or equal to 500 ng/mL (FPIA), could reliably be achieved only when the drug was administered 4 to 7 h preoperatively. Patients receiving the drug less than 4 h preoperatively generally had low levels thereafter (two of seven patients had greater than or equal to 500 ng/mL in any sample, compared with 13 of 14 patients in the 4-7-h group, P less than 0.011); an interval of greater than 7 h yielded unpredictable results. Fluids and blood products transfused, and preoperative ascites or ICU care, were not related to blood CYS levels. Oral CYS should be given 4 to 7 h before LTX to achieve adequate levels.\r"

  ".W": "Elevated serum ammonia may play a role in central nervous system derangement after transurethral resection of the prostate. Glycine used as a surgical irrigant for prostate resection produces ammonia as a by-product after liver and renal metabolism. The presence of liver dysfunction often leads to an inability to remove generated ammonia from the circulation. To determine whether the presence of cirrhosis allows significant metabolism of glycine and the resulting serum ammonia levels generated, the production of ammonia after glycine infusion was examined in normal and cirrhotic rats. Hepatic microsomal enzyme induction was produced in male Sprague-Dawley rats given sodium phenobarbital, added to the drinking water to hasten the development of cirrhosis, by increasing the toxicity of carbon tetrachloride given intragastrically to one group at weekly intervals for production of cirrhosis. A control group was maintained under similar conditions except for carbon tetrachloride dosing. The end point for production of cirrhosis was the development of ascites. Two weeks after the development of ascites in the cirrhotic rats and the discontinuation of phenobarbital in both groups, both control and cirrhotic rats were anesthetized with IP pentobarbital and glycine (1.25 g/kg; 7.5%) was given intravenously. Venous blood samples were taken at intervals up to 120 min for serum ammonia analysis. After the final serum ammonia sample, lethal pentobarbital injection was given and livers and kidneys removed for histologic analysis. Terminal body weight, glycine dose, and renal histology were not different between groups. Liver weights were greater in cirrhotic rats.Baseline serum ammonia levels were also greater int he cirrhotic rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A circle system was used to ventilate the lungs of anesthetized, intubated infants who were randomly assigned to active airway humidification and warming with use of an MR450 Servo airway heater and humidifier set at 37 degrees C (n = 10), passive airway humidification with use of the Humid-Vent Mini heat and moisture exchanger placed between the Y-piece of the circle and the endotracheal tube (n = 10), or no airway humidification and heating (control, n = 10). Anesthesia was induced with thiopental and maintained with isoflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. The relative humidity of inspired respiratory gases was approximately 35% in the control group and approximately 90% in the group undergoing active airway humidification. Initial inspired humidity in the passive humidification group (45%) increased to approximately 80% after 1 h of anesthesia. Humidity differed significantly across groups at all times (P less than or equal to 0.05). Steady-state rectal temperatures (100-120 min after induction) were 36.2 +/- 0.7 degrees C in patients given active humidification and heating, 35.7 +/- 0.9 degrees C in the passively humidified group, and 35.2 +/- 0.4 degrees C in the control group (P less than or equal to 0.05 between each group).

In this study, direct intraneural recordings of muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) in the peroneal nerve was performed to determine the profundity of blockade of sympathetic fibers to the lower extremities during epidural anesthesia. Lumbar epidural catheters were inserted in nine volunteers. Multiunit postganglionic sympathetic activity was recorded in a muscle fascicle of the peroneal nerve before and after epidural injection of 4 mL of 2% mepivacaine followed by an additional 12-16 mL after 5 min. Apnea (30-60 s) was used to elicit transient sympathetic activation. The upper level of sensory blockade was T-3 to T-10. Muscle sympathetic activity decreased after epidural blockade with no spontaneous or apnea-induced sympathetic bursts observed later than 11 min after injection of the initial test dose. Sympathetic blockade was accompanied by increase in foot skin blood flow as well as loss of skin resistance responses to arousal. Results show that epidural anesthesia with sensory blockade above T-10 to T-11 blocks spontaneous peroneal MSA as well as the marked sympathetic activation induced by apnea.\r"

The combustion of the Mallinckrodt endotracheal tube can be explained by the high energy density of the laser that, in rapidly heating the metal, was able to cause its combustion in 100% oxygen. Red rubber endotracheal tubes wrapped with 3M No. 425 or Venture copper foil tape were unaffected by 1 min of exposure to the laser beam. They are recommended for clinical use.\r"

In phase 1 (n = 10), anesthesia was maintained with 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen and halothane. In phase 2 (n = 11), a continuous infusion of propofol at a rate of 5 mg.kg-1.h-1 was started after the induction dose. Maternal venous and umbilical cord arterial and venous samples were obtained at delivery. The propofol concentration in whole blood was measured with a high performance liquid chromatography method. Where possible, breast milk/colostrum was expressed for both phases postoperatively and a sample of blood was collected during phase 2 from neonates via a heel prick 2 h after birth. Propofol crossed the placenta, as demonstrated by concentrations found in umbilical venous blood in phase 1 (0.13-0.75 micrograms/ml) and in phase 2 (0.78-1.37 micrograms/ml). At delivery, the ratio of the drug concentration in umbilical venous blood to that in maternal blood was 0.70 +/- 0.06 for phase 1 and 0.76 +/- 0.10 for phase 2.

  ".W": "To determine whether neostigmine had different effects in pediatric patients during vecuronium neuromuscular blockade, the rate of recovery following neostigmine administration was compared in infants (n = 8), children (n = 10), and adults (n = 10) during nitrous oxide-halothane anesthesia. After induction of anesthesia, patients received 100 micrograms/kg of vecuronium. The EMG response of the adductor pollicis was monitored after train-of-four (TOF) stimulation of the ulnar nerve every 20 s. When the first twitch of TOF spontaneously recovered to 10% of control value, neostigmine was injected (40 micrograms/kg in adults, 30 micrograms/kg in infants and children). During the first few minutes following neostigmine administration, no differences were observed between the three groups. After the 8 min, recovery was more rapid in children than in infants and adults up to and including the 15th min. Ten minutes after neostigmine administration, the first twitch (mean +/- SD) reached 97 +/- 3%, 99 +/- 2%, and 97 +/- 5% of control value in infants, children, and adults, respectively; TOF ratio was greater in children (0.96 +/- 0.03) than in either adults (0.82 +/- 0.17) or in infants (0.83 +/- 0.14) (P less than 0.05). During the first minutes after neostigmine administration, the lack of difference in TOF recovery in the three groups suggests that neostigmine is the main factor of recovery. In contrast, the more complete recovery after the eighth minute in children could be due to the faster rate of spontaneous recovery from vecuronium induced neuromuscular blockade in children.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to illustrate the potential for subarachnoid injection during retrobulbar block as a cause of respiratory arrest. Cadaver orbits were used to document the connection between the optic nerve sheath and the subarachnoid space. Following dissections of the orbits on one side of 24 cadavers, the optic nerve sheaths were identified and injected with 0.5 ml of water for measurement of pressure generated during injection. This was followed by intrasheath injection of equal volume of methylene blue for demonstrating the subarachnoid space surrounding the optic nerves. All injections were performed with a 1-ml syringe with a one-and-one-half-inch 22-G needle over a period of 10 s. The blue dye was found to track along the subarachnoid space of the optic nerve sheath to the chiasmatic cistern in the middle cranial fossa. Retrobulbar injections were performed on the contralateral undissected orbits and intrascleral injections were performed on undissected eyes. The size of the syringes, the gauge of the needles, and the speed of injection were uniform for all injections. The pressure generated by injection into the optic nerve sheath or intrascleral injection (approximately 138 mmHg) was three- to fourfold that produced by injection into the retrobulbar adipose tissue (approximately 35 mmHg) (P less than 0.05). The authors conclude that any resistance encountered during retrobulbar block should serve as a warning signal, mandating redirection of the needle, in order to prevent subarachnoid injection.\r"

In part 1, a Doppler fetal heart rate monitoring probe was placed over the precordium of 33 laboring patients in whom functioning epidural catheters were in place. Each patient received, more than 90 s apart, in random order: 10 ml of agitated saline (containing less than 0.5 ml of air microbubbles) via a peripheral vein; 2 ml of air via the epidural catheter; and a sham injection (i.e., nothing injected). In all 33 cases, a blinded observer identified Doppler changes 10-30 s following the injection of air (microbubbles) via peripheral vein. Doppler changes were never heard following epidural air injection (P less than 0.001 compared with iv air microbubble injection) or the sham injection (P less than 0.001 compared with iv air microbubble injection). In part 2, the authors listened for Doppler heart tone changes while injecting 1 ml of air via catheters that were accidentally inserted in the epidural veins of five other patients. Unequivocal Doppler changes compatible with intracardiac air always occurred within 3 s, and no signs or symptoms of air embolism developed. The results suggest that 1 ml of air may be a suitable indicator of iv epidural catheter location.\r"

  ".W": "The tape recorded EEGs of 127 patients anesthetized with large doses of opioids were retrospectively analyzed for evidence of opioid-induced seizures, and in particular, correlated with movements that occurred during induction and could be clinically interpreted as seizures. Bilateral EEG leads in patients receiving fentanyl (20), sufentanil (20), or alfentanil (87) were recorded. Forty-six of these patients from all opioid groups manifested intense rigidity, as assessed both clinically and by EMGs recorded from eight muscles in 69 of the patients receiving alfentanil. This intense rigidity often resembled seizures, in that the phenomenon entailed severe stiffness of both limbs and trunk, with an explosive onset of myoclonic limb movements, and associated vertical nystagmus. Electroencephalographic observations were extensive, entailing 69 h of paper recordings played back from the tapes, at paper speeds of 30 or 60 mm/s, with detailed annotations from the voice track. These paper recordings were examined in detail independently by three of the investigators, who were unaware of the clinical phenomena that had occurred. The only observed EEG activity that could have been interpreted as epileptiform consisted of small sharp waves related to muscle activity or other artifact. The EEG never indicated seizure activity during these drug-induced movements and rigidity. Reports of opioid-induced seizures are reviewed and a set of criteria is offered to help achieve future consistency and credibility in evaluating this phenomenon. The available evidence does not support the existence of opioid-induced seizures in the clinical setting.\r"

Ancrod is a defibrinogenating enzyme that has been used as an anticoagulant in humans, but its use as an anticoagulant for CPB has been limited to studies in animals. Twenty patients for elective aortocoronary bypass surgery were anticoagulated by means of an intravenous infusion of ancrod pre-operatively. Target plasma fibrinogen concentrations of 0.40-0.80 g/l were achieved within 13.3 +/- 2.5 h using an average dose of ancrod of 1.65 +/- 0.55 U/g. All perfusions were without incident. Postoperative blood loss (2286 +/- 1311 cc) was compared to that of 20 matched controls (1737 +/- 973 cc), as was blood product use; 4.1 +/- 2.1 U of packed cells versus 2.5 +/- 2.3 U (P less than 0.05) and 5.6 +/- 3.1 U of plasma versus 2.6 +/- 2.9 U (P less than 0.05) in the ancrod and heparin-treated groups, respectively. There were no differences in the postoperative courses or recovery periods of the ancrod-treated and control patients. This study confirms the efficacy and feasibility of ancrod as an alternative form of anticoagulation for CPB.\r"

  ".W": "The factors of age and gender, which have been linked to development of fulminant halothane hepatitis in humans, were evaluated in a guinea pig model of acute halothane-associated hepatotoxicity. Since nitrous oxide is commonly coadministered with halothane and has been shown to exacerbate halothane-associated liver injury in rats; this combination of anesthetics was also evaluated in guinea pigs. Male and female strain 13 guinea pigs (300-1000 g) were exposed to 1% v/v halothane and 39% O2 for 4 h with a balance of either 60% N2 or 60% N2O. Both animal age, as determined by body weight, and gender proved to be factors in the model with older (approximately 6.2 +/- 1.0 month) guinea pigs of both sexes, demonstrating significantly greater elevations in plasma ALT and a greater incidence of centilobular necrosis versus younger (approximately 3.1 +/- 0.6 month) animals. Older females showed a greater hepatotoxic response than older males. There were no significant differences in halothane plasma metabolite levels between older and younger animals of either gender. The addition of nitrous oxide affected neither plasma concentrations of halothane metabolites nor the degree of resultant hepatic injury. Older (approximately 5-6 month) male guinea pigs, from a strain (inbred Hartley) previously shown to be resistant to the halothane lesion, did not develop centrilobular necrosis following halothane exposure even though they generated plasma metabolite concentrations equivalent to those generated by strain 13 animals. The lack of differences in the biotransformation of halothane between groups indicates that other intrinsic factors must be involved in the observed variations in susceptibility to hepatic injury.\r"

Following PA constriction, RV systolic pressure more than doubled, RV end-diastolic and systolic dimensions increased, and stroke volume (SV) and segment shortening fell (P all less than 0.05). There was no evidence of regional myocardial dysfunction (i.e., akinesis, systolic lengthening, postsystolic shortening), and reactive hyperemia in response to right coronary artery occlusion was present. Subsequent addition of HAL (0.8%) resulted in further increases in end-diastolic and systolic dimensions, and in marked decreases in right coronary blood flow, segment shortening, SV, and aortic pressure. During HAL 1.5% (range: 1.2-1.6%), regional myocardial dysfunction developed in three animals, reactive hyperemia was abolished in five out of six animals tested, and metabolic acidosis developed. Release of PA constriction during 1.5% HAL in seven animals resulted in improved global and regional RV performance, disappearance of regional myocardial dysfunction, and restoration of reactive hyperemia. In this canine model of acute RVH, increasing concentrations of HAL led to increasing deterioration in global and regional RV performance most likely due to inadequate coronary perfusion.\r"

In addition, carotid arterial blood pressure waveforms recorded by these systems in sheep, at two different heart rates, were compared with those simultaneously recorded with a catheter-tip pressure transducer. A new term, \"Working Heart Rate\" is defined and allows for the prediction of the maximum heart rate up to which a system of given frequency response and damping coefficient should be accurate. When tested in vitro, all the monitoring systems were underdamped and resonated. The performance of all systems was improved by inclusion of an adjustable resonance elimination device but impaired by a nonadjustable resonance eliminator or by recording with an electronically filtered amplifier. When tested in vivo, the accuracy of mean and diastolic blood pressure measurement was not affected by any combination of heart rate, amplifier, length of extension tubing, or use of resonance eliminators. Both resonance elimination devices improved the performance of all systems. In contrast to predictions based on frequency response and damping, the smallest errors in systolic blood pressure were recorded using the electronic filter or the nonadjustable resonance eliminator. There were considerable and misleading differences between the frequency responses and damping coefficients calculated in vitro and those, for the same systems, derived from the in vivo fast-flush tests. It is concluded that the most accurate and consistent readings of systolic blood pressure will be achieved with the use of either an electronic filter or a nonadjustable resonance eliminator.\r"

A gas chromatographic assay was used to measure the plasma, urine, bile concentrations, and liver content of pipecuronium, the later of which was obtained 8 h after injection. Following an iv bolus injection of 0.1 mg/kg, pipecuronium disappeared from the plasma exponentially with distribution half-lives of 3.9 +/- 1.1 min and 12.7 +/- 9.5 min (mean +/- SD), and elimination half-lives of 44.8 +/- 2.6 min and 196.7 +/- 102.0 min in animals with and without renal pedicle ligation, respectively. Except for the volume of central compartment, all other pharmacokinetic variables differed significantly between the two experimental groups. The elimination half-life was longer (196.7 +/- 102 (SD) vs. 44.8 +/- 2.6 min), plasma clearance slower (5.9 +/- 0.8 ml.kg-1.min-1 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.1 ml.kg-1.min-1) and mean residence time longer (221 +/- 73 vs. 51.1 +/- 1.8 min) in dogs with ligated renal pedicles. Eight hours after injection, the recovery of the parent form of pipecuronium approximated 77% of the administered dose in the urine, 4.5% in the bile, and 3.3% in the liver of normal animals. In animals with ligated renal pedicles 16% of the unchanged pipecuronium was excreted into the bile and 10% of the administered dose was recovered from the liver. Since the total recovery of unaltered pipecuronium approximated 85% of the administered dose in the intact animals, biotransformation seems to play an insignificant role in disposition of this new neuromuscular blocking drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Significantly shorter periods of arrhythmia after each dose of epinephrine were seen in rats anesthetized with pentobarbital than were seen in rats anesthetized with halothane. No significant difference was seen between MgSO4 or MgCl2 infusions in any of these studies. Twenty-minute infusions of MgSO4 (8 mg.kg-1.min-1) were compared with propranolol (0.03 mg.kg-1.min-1) and verapamil (0.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) infusions on the duration of arrhythmia after epinephrine (8 micrograms/kg) injections in halothane anesthetized rats. MgSO4 and propranolol infusion caused a significant reduction in the duration of arrhythmia (81% and 70%, respectively). Verapamil infusion caused only a 48% reduction in arrhythmia duration. While there was no significant difference between MgSO4 or propranolol, both caused a significantly greater reduction in arrhythmia than verapamil.

  ".W": "This study examined the interaction between thiopental and epinephrine in inducing ventricular arrhythmias in dogs. The arrhythmogenic threshold of epinephrine was determined during anesthesia with either halothane alone, thiopental alone, etomidate plus different doses of thiopental, or halothane plus different doses of thiopental. The arrhythmogenic dose and the corresponding plasma concentration of epinephrine during thiopental anesthesia (plasma thiopental concentration: 46-57 micrograms/ml) were 0.77 +/- 0.04 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 and 10.7 +/- 1.5 ng/ml, respectively. During halothane anesthesia (end-tidal: 1.3 MAC) they were 2.59 +/- 0.49 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 and 45.3 +/- 9.2 ng/ml, respectively. The dose-effect relationship for the thiopental action was examined during etomidate plus thiopental and halothane plus thiopental anesthesia. The arrhythmogenic plasma concentration of epinephrine was inversely proportional to the plasma thiopental concentration during both anesthetics. During etomidate plus thiopental anesthesia, at plasma thiopental concentrations of 0, 11.2 +/- 0.83, 20.1 +/- 1.34, and 33.2 +/- 1.95 micrograms/ml, the corresponding epinephrine concentrations were 201.3 +/- 34.3, 142 +/- 19.5, 69.1 +/- 21.2, and 22.7 +/- 4.5 ng/ml. During halothane plus thiopental anesthesia, at plasma thiopental concentrations of 0, 10 +/- 0.86, 18.3 +/- 0.87, and 31.8 +/- 1.05 micrograms/ml, the corresponding epinephrine concentrations were 45.3 +/- 9.2, 34.6 +/- 8.9, 16.2 +/- 1.74, and 15.1 +/- 1.32 micrograms/ml, respectively. These results suggest that thiopental sensitizes the heart to epinephrine in a dose-dependent manner. This sensitizing action of thiopental would in part explain the thiopental potentiation of hydrocarbon anesthetic-epinephrine arrhythmias.\r"

A fourth ventricle to cisterna magna perfusion (VCP) system was used for drug administration. This permitted a direct comparison of the dose/ventilatory response characteristics of these morphine metabolites to each other and to morphine and obviated the need to consider the blood-brain barrier delay that would complicate analysis of systemic dose versus ventilatory response relationships among these drugs. The dose/response pattern for morphine was taken from an earlier study in unanesthetized dogs where the identical mode of drug delivery as in the present report was employed. Morphine-3-glucuronide caused, if anything, a ventilatory stimulation (decreased PaCO2 and increased CO2 responsiveness) at the highest infusate concentration studied (50 micrograms/ml) and no significant ventilatory effects at infusate concentrations at or below 10 micrograms/ml. On the other hand, M-6-G produced a profound dose-dependent ventilatory depression. Significant increases in PaCO2 and diminution of CO2 responsiveness were observed even at the lowest infusate concentration evaluated (0.1 microgram/ml). When compared to morphine, M-6-G was found to be about five to ten times more potent as a ventilatory depressant drug. These results imply that M-6-G may play a significant role in the ventilatory depression accompanying systemic morphine administration.\r"

  ".U": "90072721\r", 
  ".W": "Most paroxysmal forms of clinical supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) are likely due to re-entrant excitation. Electrophysiologically demonstrated mechanisms for re-entrant SVT include, in descending order of importance, atrioventricular (AV) node, AV node and accessory (AV bypass) pathway, sinus node, or atrial re-entry. Except for sinus node re-entry, none of these mechanisms for re-entrant SVT can be reliably reproduced in animal models. The authors suspected, however, that anesthetic effects on atrial and AV nodal electrophysiologic properties might be used to predict their actions against suspected re-entrant SVT. Awake-to-anesthetized (1.2 and 1.6 MAC) comparisons for the effects of enflurane (ENF), halothane (HAL), and isoflurane (ISO) on atrial and AV nodal electrophysiologic properties were made in ten chronically instrumented dogs. Studies were carried out with and without pharmacologic autonomic blockade with atropine, propranolol, and hexamethonium. By ANOVA, significant (P less than 0.05) effects of the anesthetics included: prolongation of AV nodal conduction time and the Wenckebach point in dogs with autonomic blockade (ENF, HAL, ISO); increased atrial effective and functional refractory periods in dogs without autonomic blockade (ENF, ISO); increased atrial functional refractory period in dogs without autonomic blockade (HAL); increased AV nodal functional refractory period in dogs with and without autonomic blockade (ENF, ISO), or with autonomic blockade (HAL). Sinus node re-entry, manifest by atrial echo beats during high right atrial stimulation, could be demonstrated in several dogs of each anesthetic test group during awake electrophysiologic testing. All anesthetics, with or without autonomic blockade and autonomic blockade in awake dogs, invariably abolished such re-entry. It is concluded that any anesthetic that increases atrial and AV nodal refractoriness should not be conducive to SVT caused by AV node or atrial re-entry. All of the anesthetics tested also appear effective against sinus node re-entry in dogs in which this mechanism can be demonstrated. Finally, no conclusions can be reached concerning anesthetic effects on re-entry requiring participation of both AV node and AV bypass pathways, since anesthetic effects on AV bypass pathways were not tested.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of epidural anesthesia on cardiovascular responses and survival in experimental hemorrhagic shock in dogs. Thirty mongrel dogs were randomly assigned to one of three groups on the basis of anesthetic technique: the upper-level group (n = 10), receiving general anesthesia plus upper-level (mainly thoracic region) epidural anesthesia; the lower-level group (n = 10), receiving general anesthesia plus lower-level (mainly lumbar region) epidural anesthesia; and the control group (n = 10), receiving general anesthesia alone. After withdrawal of blood, the changes in mean arterial pressure (40 mmHg) and cardiac index were similar in all groups. In the upper-level group, a lower heart rate and systemic vascular resistance than the control group were maintained throughout in the presence of severe hypotension. A significant difference in survival was seen between the upper-level and control groups over the 100-min observation period as a whole (P less than 0.05 by the Generalized Wilcoxon test), since, at the end of the period, only two of the ten animals in the control group survived, whereas nine of ten in the upper-level group survived (P less than 0.001 by the Kaplan-Meier test). This result demonstrates that, in dogs lightly anesthetized with halothane and nitrous oxide, upper thoracic level epidural anesthesia significantly improves survival in experimental hemorrhagic shock (compared with survival in dogs with lumbar epidural or no epidural anesthesia) when the epidural is performed before hemorrhage and when the mean arterial pressure is constant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Volume ventilation by demand flow ventilators significantly increases work of breathing during inspiration. Although various ventilator modifications and different modes of ventilation have been developed, there have been few studies regarding imposed work of breathing in infants and children. This study was designed to evaluate several modifications of a commercially available demand flow ventilator designed to shorten response time (tr) and decrease the imposed work (Wi) involved in opening the demand valve. Minimum withdrawal volume (Vmin), maximum negative pressure (P mneg), and tr were measured. Wi was defined as the product of Vmin and P mneg. Seven Siemens Servo 900C ventilators were tested under 16 different trial conditions with four variables: 1) mode of ventilation (synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation [SIMV] vs. pressure support ventilation [PSV]); 2) caliber of circuit tubing (adult vs. pediatric); 3) location of airway pressure monitor (distal vs. proximal); and 4) ventilator trigger sensitivity (0 cm H2O--high vs. -2 cm H2O--low). Vmin, Pmneg, and Wi were all decreased (P less than .05) while tr was unaffected by changing ventilator trigger sensitivity from low to high. Wi was decreased by pediatric tubing and proximal airway pressure monitoring only when low trigger sensitivity was used. PSV and proximal airway monitoring shortened tr. The authors conclude that the use of pediatric circuit tubing and proximal airway pressure monitoring with a Siemens Servo 900C ventilator significantly improved ventilator performance.\r"

  ".U": "90072758\r", 
  ".W": "In the absence of respiratory distress and massive visceral herniation, the diagnosis of blunt diaphragmatic disruption can be difficult. This is particularly true for diaphragmatic injuries confined to the right hemidiaphragm. Because diagnostic delay and strangulation are associated with notable increases in mortality and morbidity, it is important to identify the injury as early as possible. Victims of lateral impact motor vehicle collisions are more likely to experience rupture of the diaphragm than victims of frontal collisions. Occupants exposed to left lateral impacts are at greatest risk. The side of diaphragmatic rupture correlates with the direction of impact. The right hemidiaphragm is more resistant to rupture. Deformation shear is a more plausible mechanism for diaphragmatic rupture after lateral impacts. Knowledge of the mechanisms that produce this injury combined with information regarding the victim's seat position and direction of the impacting force should lead to a high index of clinical suspicion for diaphragmatic rupture. Chest radiography and diagnostic peritoneal lavage will establish the correct diagnosis in almost 90% of the patients with acute diaphragmatic disruption. Additional diagnostic studies are reserved for the remaining 10% of patients. Due to the pressure differential between abdomen and thorax, the natural history of these injuries is one of enlargement, and none can be expected to heal spontaneously. Once the diagnosis has been established, the treatment of every diaphragmatic disruption is surgical repair.\r"

A set of educational objectives was developed by a task force composed of representatives of the American College of Emergency Physicians, the Society of Teachers of Emergency Medicine, and the University Association for Emergency Medicine. A questionnaire then was sent to the directors of all emergency medicine residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to determine the degree to which those objectives are covered in residency training. A 62% response rate was achieved. The data revealed that such topics as narcotic prescription law, patterns of risk, and issues pertaining to substance abuse by physicians were covered by fewer than half of the programs responding. Respondents were generally satisfied with the adequacy of training of residents and faculty in the area of substance abuse; however, they were dissatisfied with the adequacy of available training materials. Recommendations for changes in graduate curriculum as well as avenues for further research are provided.\r"

Another emergency function of intravascular access is obtaining blood samples for blood gases, laboratory studies, and blood cultures. One of the drawbacks to using the intraosseous route as an alternative to IV access has been the persistent need to establish IV access to obtain blood samples. We obtained bone marrow samples from ten healthy anesthetized dogs and analyzed the usefulness of the samples in providing meaningful laboratory studies when compared with simultaneous arterial and venous samples for blood electrolytes, blood chemistries, blood gases, and hemoglobin. There was no significant difference (P greater than .10) in blood electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, and carbon dioxide) drawn from the intraosseous, arterial, and venous sites. The blood chemistries (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphorous, uric acid, total bilirubin, and SGOT) also were not significantly different (P greater than .10). Significant differences were obtained for glucose comparing intraosseous with arterial (P = .03), whereas intraosseous versus venous was only marginally significant (P = .06). Significant differences were also obtained for alkaline phosphatase when comparing intraosseous with arterial (P = .03), whereas comparison with venous was only marginally significant (P = .06): lactate dehydrogenase differences were marginally significant when comparing intraosseous with arterial (P = .09) and venous (P = .06) blood. Hemoglobin values were not significantly different when comparing results for the three sites (P greater than .25).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A higher prevalence of posterior vitreous detachment was found in eyes with the major chorioretinal lesion outside the temporal vascular arcade than in those with lesions inside the temporal vascular arcade (P less than .05). Our results indicated that various vitreous changes may cause posterior vitreous detachment and that location of the inflammatory focus may influence the vitreous condition.\r"

As expected, levels exceeded unanesthetized measurements by one to two times. Based on experimental data, this could decrease the threshold for light-induced retinal damage during ophthalmic surgery by 40% to 50%. While the clinical implications of light-induced retinal damage in surgical eye patients are unclear, it is prudent to take steps to minimize light exposure during surgery.\r"

This solution is tolerated well by the human eye, protects the endothelium, maintains the depth of the anterior chamber, and facilitates the insertion of the intraocular lens. We have had no significant increases in intraocular pressure or excessive intraocular inflammation. In routine cases of implantation surgery, there is no reason to use more expensive viscoelastic substances. Because this substance is universally available, it can be prepared easily for intraocular use, and it is inexpensive making its use in developing countries strongly recommended.\r"

We did a study in which the levels of waste anesthetic gases were measured during xenon arc photocoagulation procedures used for retinoblastoma. Waste nitrous oxide and halothane gases measured during these procedures significantly exceeded the levels recommended by the National Institute of Safety and Health. These high levels are of particular importance because of the physician's proximity to the patient during the procedure. The high levels of waste gases may have immediate deleterious effects on the physician's functioning capacity and may also pose long-term health hazards for the physician and operating room personnel.\r"

One hundred twenty-eight patients received a tracheoesophageal puncture and adjunctive pharyngeal constrictor relaxation during laryngectomy. The voice prosthesis was applied as early as 10 days after surgery, and the results of a 9-year experience are presented. Eighty percent of the population achieved a durable voice, and the complications were infrequent. The results support the primary use of tracheoesophageal phonation as a relatively safe and reliable alternative to total laryngectomy alone.\r"

For patients with a mature stenosis of short length, excision of the anterior arch of the cricoid and first ring and immediate reconstruction by means of a sliding flap of the next two to three rings of trachea offer a one-stage definitive treatment without the need for grafting. We report four cases of subglottic stenosis and one case of cricoid chondroblastoma in which reconstruction of the airway was successful and prompt. For carefully selected cases, sliding flap tracheoplasty may be a useful alternative to procedures in which the airway is expanded by means of grafting.\r"

Final voice quality was subjectively good in all patients. Follow-up has ranged from 1 year 10 months to 5 years 8 months, and initial improvement has been sustained in all cases. Carbon dioxide laser posterior partial cordectomy is an alternative management option for relief of upper airway obstruction due to bilateral vocal cord paralysis. The procedure can be performed without prophylactic tracheotomy. Subjectively good voice quality is preserved.\r"

The first study followed patients after prolonged intubation with the standard ETT. Potential patient host factors were recorded and correlated with subjective complaints and objective findings on fiberoptic laryngoscopy. Nearly all patients sustained laryngeal injury after prolonged intubation, although over two thirds experienced resolution. Nasogastric feeding tubes and larger-diameter ETTs were associated with true vocal cord (TVC) granuloma formation. Duration of intubation was associated with delayed TVC immobility. The mechanisms of TVC granulomas and immobility are probably different, as suggested by the different host factor associations and onset times. The second study compared the standard ETT with the prototype ETT in short-term intubations. The prototype ETT was associated with no complications in this setting and is considered relatively safe for further testing in the patient with prolonged intubation.\r"

Amplitudes were greater, wave V latencies longer, and detectability better for responses to 500-Hz BC tones compared to 2,000-Hz BC tones. Overall, most (94% to 100%) infants with normal cochlear sensitivity demonstrate ABRs to 20-dB normal hearing level (nHL) 500-Hz BC tones and 30-dB nHL 2,000-Hz BC tones. In cases in which masking is difficult (eg, bilateral atresia), infant ipsilateral/contralateral ABR asymmetries may help determine from which cochlea a response to the BC tones originates. In conclusion, two-channel ABR recordings to BC tones appear to be feasible for demonstrating normal cochlear sensitivity in infants.\r"

Forty-four patients treated with either tobramycin or vancomycin for osteomyelitis were tested at the beginning of treatment, following treatment, and twice weekly during treatment when possible. All patients had renal function carefully monitored. Peak and trough drug levels were kept out of the toxic range throughout the study. In no patient did indisputable ototoxicity occur, and therefore, no conclusion about the most efficacious schedule for auditory monitoring of patients receiving ototoxic drugs was made, and what constitutes a significant intratherapeutic threshold shift is still in question. Until further data are collected, monitoring of renal function and peak and trough drug levels, as well as patient counseling, is recommended. Pretherapy and posttherapy auditory monitoring and intratherapeutic monitoring of high-risk patients and those who develop aural symptoms may prove beneficial.\r"

In six the diagnosis of SMTI was made clinically, and these patients were managed conservatively with massage and controlled stretching of the neck. Resolution of the neck mass, the torticollis, and the facial asymmetry occurred in all patients. Pathologic and radiographic findings are presented. We conclude that careful clinical assessment precludes the necessity of biopsy and emphasize the importance of conservative management of this transient problem.\r"

Tracheoesophageal speech proved comparable to normal speech in maximum phonation time, speech rate, pitch pertubation (jitter), average fundamental frequency, and fundamental frequency range, but less efficient than normal speech in phrase grouping. Tracheoesophageal speech was superior to esophageal speech in maximum phonation time, speech rate, and phrase grouping, but not significantly different in pitch perturbation, average fundamental frequency, and fundamental frequency range. Explanations and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

Varied open operative approaches and microelectrode designs were utilized. Silicon substrate thin film and platinum-iridium wire electrodes, tethered and untethered, were placed successfully in different divisions of the CN. Implantation through a posterior suboccipital approach was most successful. Histologic examinations demonstrated a glial cell proliferation confined to the area of the electrode track that never exceeded 15 microns in width. No neuronal loss or significant effect on cell morphology was seen, and reactive cells were absent. Electrode migration was apparent in a minority of animal preparations. Although potential problems were identified, our findings lend support to the feasibility of implanting a neuroprosthesis in the CN and have helped to establish methods for future studies of chronic intranuclear stimulation.\r"
