Using a conventional epidermal culture medium and stimulation with UVB irradiation or 8-MOP + UVA treatment, melanocytes were found to grow out from the biopsy with the epidermal sheet. In this newly formed epidermis, melanocytes and keratinocytes were maintained in an architectural relationship similar to that present in vivo and melanocyte outgrowth could be quantitatively evaluated. Consequently, this pigmented human skin equivalent is a useful model for investigating the biology and photobiology of human skin pigmentation.\r"

The study was conducted in two parts. In part one, the effect of EMLA on the threshold concentration of histamine necessary to induce pruritus was assessed by a double-blind placebo controlled method. In part two, the effect of EMLA on the perception of pruritus induced by the artificial pruritogens cowhage and papain was assessed by a single blind method. Some subjects were less sensitive to histamine after placebo cream treatment, but all subjects showed a marked reduction in sensitivity to histamine after EMLA treatment. The difference between EMLA and the placebo treatment was statistically significant. The EMLA preparation was found to be effective in alleviating pruritus induced by cowhage and papain and this effect was also statistically significant. Thus, EMLA cream was found to be effective in reducing experimentally induced pruritus and, therefore, may be useful in some clinical circumstances where persistent itch is a distressing symptom.\r"

These results show that surfactant has a stimulatory effect on amniotic PGE production and that it is an important source of arachidonic acid in amniotic fluid.\r"

Overall, 825 recordings were made from 368 women (2.24 per woman). There were 56 unsuccessful attempts at transmission (6.8%), most were due to problems with telephone equipment. The system worked most efficiently when a dedicated direct line was used. The data transmission time varied between 40 and 60 s. The median telephone time (including data transmission and conversation) with a dedicated direct line was 7 min. Mean acceptance times from the four centres were between 70 and 80%. All recordings with acceptance times of 40% or more were interpretable. Ten recordings were abnormal. The women and mid-wives were equally proficient at using the DFM system. The DFM system represents an important addition to current methods of fetal assessment. Specific guidelines are outlined.\r"

Although mean fundal height is substantially greater in twin than singleton pregnancies, the value of the technique to detect multiple pregnancies may be limited because combined birth-weight is less and the frequency of SGA fetuses is greater in undiagnosed than in diagnosed twin pregnancies. We found no evidence that the measured fundal height is greater in pregnancies going on to preterm delivery, and we suggest that the commonly accepted theory that the high rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies results simply from uterine overdistension be reappraised. Nevertheless, fundal height measurement was of value in identifying pregnancies in which both babies were SGA and is therefore recommended as a simple, inexpensive and non-invasive technique.\r"

The use of wound drainage was consistent between surgeons of differing levels of experience and different subspecialty interests within gynaecology. At routine 'clean' operations the use of drains is limited; only 0.4% of gynaecologists drain the peritoneal cavity, 1% the pelvis, 4% the subcutaneous tissues, and 20% the rectus sheath routinely. At more specialist 'clean' procedures, however, greater use of drains is made; at suprapubic incontinence operations 51% of surgeons drain the retropubic space; at radical hysterectomy 55% drain the pelvis; and at radical vulvectomy 63% use drains in the groins, routinely. In all the above operations much greater use is made of active (83%) than passive drains (17%). With potentially contaminated wounds, however, 46% of gynaecologists use a passive drain.\r"

The mean gestational ages of the first two groups were 32 weeks with a high proportion of infants small-for-gestational-age. In group 1, FHR variation (mean range of pulse intervals) was less than half (20.6 SE 1.2 ms) of the normal value at the same age (44.4 SE 1.5 ms). This was associated with hypoxaemia (mean umbilical artery PO2 of 6 mmHg at delivery), with evidence of compensation shown by an elevated amniotic fluid erythropoietin. The fetuses were hypoglycaemic and had greater umbilical artery blood alanine concentrations, but no large changes in adenine nucleotide or endorphin plasma concentrations. Although there was a minor degree of respiratory acidaemia at birth, there was not significant metabolic acidaemia. The results demonstrate that the reduced variation of 'suboptimal' and 'decelerative' fetal heart rate records is associated with fetal hypoxaemia and evidence of nutritional deprivation, but not with asphyxia.\r"

The classical incision was associated with a higher frequency of postpartum fever in the immediate postoperative period (16% compared with 6%, P less than 0.01). Of the 326 patients reviewed 286 (88%) were contacted for information about subsequent pregnancies. Information was obtained for 70 pregnancies subsequent to a classical caesarean section, and 71 pregnancies subsequent to a low-segment transverse caesarean section, which had continued for more than 20 weeks gestation. Of the pregnancies after the classical operation 13% had abnormal scars compared with none of those after the low-segment transverse operation (P = 0.0014). The frequency of scar dehiscence was 6% after a classical scar compared with none after a low-segment transverse scar (P = 0.0581).\r"

Agreement between the two sources of data was evaluated using kappa statistics and intraclass correlation coefficients. Excellent agreement was observed for some variables such as maternal and newborn anthropometric measures, and previous birthweight, but there was poor agreement for others such as indicators of physical activity, work during pregnancy and blood pressure measures. Some of the limitations are due to problems in phrasing questions, patients' recall, interviewer bias and abstracting data. We recommend that epidemiological studies should always include a reliability component, proper standardization of personnel and instruments and include, when published, validity data and examples of questions used.\r"

In early pregnancy there was evidence of increased and reversible resorption of bone, whereas in late pregnancy bone demonstrated active formation and rapid mineralization with minimal resorption. Gut absorption of calcium was not increased in early pregnancy. The overall findings were consistent with calcium liberation from bone in early pregnancy, and with enhanced conservation of bone calcium at term. It is proposed that the additional calcium required during pregnancy is derived largely from the skeleton during early gestation and from dietary absorption at term.\r"

Mean and standard deviation values within 2 h and greater than 2 h after a meal were calculated. A standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was then given to 250 of the 276 pregnant women. Three patients were found to be diabetic and 46 had post-load concentrations indicative of impaired glucose tolerance according to the criteria of the World Health Organization (1980). Using a cut-off point whereby 15% of the population would be tested, we would have identified only 2 of the 3 diabetics and 12 of the 46 with impaired glucose tolerance. This poor predictive power cannot be resolved by altering cut-off points for screening, or by altering the criteria for abnormal glucose tolerance. The basic problem is lack of a close relation between 2-h glucose tolerance value and random glucose when this has been taken greater than 120 min after a meal. In this population with a high prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance, random plasma glucose is not an efficient screening test.\r"

Maternal plasma levels of oxytocin before the onset of contractions were not significantly different from those at the onset of spontaneous labour or at full cervical dilatation. Levels of oxytocin in patients induced with oxytocin were not statistically different from levels observed in spontaneous labour. Amniotic fluid oxytocin levels were not significantly different between the groups either at the onset of labour or immediately before delivery. Umbilical arterio-venous differences in oxytocin were present in all groups except the prostaglandin-induced group. Increased prostaglandins associated with the onset of normal labour are probably not a consequence of changes in oxytocin concentrations.\r"

The effect of lysine vasopressin infusion (1 pmol/kg body-weight per min) and of bolus injection of a synthetic oxytocin analogue, 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin (10 nmol/kg body-weight), were studied. Spontaneous variations in blood flow were seen synchronous with clearly demarcated uterine contractions, the myometrial activity being significantly increased in early (day -1 to day +2) compared with late (day +3 to day +5) menstrual phase. The vasopressin infusion decreased blood flow, stimulated uterine activity and caused slight to moderate dysmenorrhoea-like pain. These effects were completely inhibited by the injection of the oxytocin analogue. In-vitro studies on uterine arteries confirmed that the analogue also inhibited the vasopressin-induced constriction of the uterine arteries. This antagonist was more effective than two other analogues, 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr(OEt)-4-Val-8-Orn-oxytocin and 1-deamino-2-Tyr(OEt)-oxytocin. The counteracting effect of 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin on the vasopressin-induced decrease of blood flow and increase of contractions supports the therapeutic value of the drug in primary dysmenorrhoea and preterm labour.\r"

Seven aspects of 'abnormal' menstruation were defined: prolonged periods, heavy periods, frequent periods, irregular periods, intermenstrual bleeding, painful periods and severe premenstrual syndrome. Women who used oral contraceptives were less likely than other women to report any of the seven menstrual abnormalities except for intermenstrual bleeding and severe premenstrual tension. Women who used an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) reported prolonged, heavy, and frequent periods and intermenstrual bleeding more often than other women, but they did not report painful periods with undue frequency. Women who had had a tubal sterilization generally reported menstrual patterns similar to, or slightly less favourable than, women using no contraception or contraceptive methods other than the pill or the IUCD. There was a significant association between smoking habits and each of the abnormal menstrual patterns except for severe premenstrual tension. In every case, the effect of smoking was unfavourable and in almost every case, current smokers reported the worst experience, with ex-smokers occupying an intermediate position. We believe that these data are of considerable clinical significance and that they offer a basis for a conservative approach to managing menstrual disorders in some women.\r"

Peripheral retinal vessel closure was present in approximately 50% of children with SS and SC genotypes at age 6 years and increased to affect 90% of children by age 12 years. A matched pair analysis, comparing groups with minimal and complete closure, indicated that complete closure was associated with significantly lower total haemoglobin and fetal haemoglobin levels and significantly lower weight in SS disease, whereas in SC disease the risk factors appeared to be high mean cell volume and low platelet count. Proliferative retinopathy was rare, occurring only once in an 8-year-old boy with SC disease, despite 592 patient years of observation in children over this age.\r"

The results showed that IOL implantation did not have a detrimental effect on postoperative IOP reduction, gain in visual acuity, or needs for antiglaucoma medication. The incidence of anterior chamber reactions consisting of the development of posterior synechiae and fibrin formation was significantly higher when IOL had been implanted. However, the fibrin was generally absorbed within 14 days and the posterior synechiae did not occlude the visual axis. We conclude that IOL implantation should be included in these combined operations with the object of rehabilitating visual function.\r"

At an intraocular pressure of 47 mmHg the blood velocity and volumetric blood flow rate were significantly smaller and arterial blood velocity pulsatility was significantly greater than normal. The corresponding 88% reduction in perfusion pressure was accompanied by a 67% reduction in total retinal blood flow, indicating that autoregulation is not efficient at this level of intraocular pressure. An Octopus visual field examination obtained immediately following blood flow measurements suggested that the central retina can preserve a fairly good function under a total retinal blood flow rate of about one-third of the normal value.\r"

Subjects viewed 100 ms duration stimuli which embodied 30 arc min of either crossed or uncrossed disparity under four conditions of spherical overcorrection: -0.25, +1.0, +2.0, +3.0 dioptres. The first condition, essentially normal refraction, yielded reliable behavioural reports of the stimulus and clear evoked potentials to both crossed and uncrossed disparity. With increasing overcorrection the behavioural reports became less reliable, and the evoked potentials were degraded for both conditions of disparity. The responses to the crossed disparity condition, however, showed significantly less degradation in both behavioural and electrophysiological measures. The implications of this finding may be that there are separate cortical subsystems for the processing of crossed and uncrossed disparity and that the former is more robust under non-ideal viewing conditions.\r"

Only two gave a history of a recent increase in physical activity. The plain radiographic findings consisted of an uninterrupted, lamellar, periosteal reaction arising medially and posteriorly in the proximal tibia with the fracture seen through the thickened posterior cortex. Bone scan revealed a fusiform focus of increased uptake in the posteromedial cortex of the tibia with varying degrees of activity in the adjacent metaphysis. Computed tomography, on a soft-tissue window, showed perifracture oedema and the absence of a soft-tissue mass. The attenuation of the underlying medulla was increased as a result of fibrosis and hyperaemia. On an extended window setting, both periosteal and endosteal callus was identified, maximal in the posteromedial tibia, and the fractures, multiple in two cases, were best demonstrated on a cortical window. Clinical and radiological features that differentiate a fatigue fracture of the tibia from a sarcoma are discussed.\r"

Nineteen other patients had pharyngeal dysfunction. Eighteen patients were examined because of retrosternal pain on swallowing. One had a pedunculated pharyngeal cyst while two had pharyngeal dysfunction. The other examinations were normal. Our results show that a careful radiological examination of the pharyngeal function is of value in young adults with swallowing complaints. Even in acute dysphagia a foreign body is seldom revealed. In patients who had undergone cineradiography, 21 of 90 (23%) had some form of pharyngeal dysfunction which could account for the patients' symptoms.\r"

The purpose of the intercomparison was to provide a basis for the exchange of dose-response data and to facilitate the involvement of Clatterbridge in collaborative clinical trials. Tissue-equivalent ionization chambers were used by the participants in each intercomparison to compare measurements of total (neutron plus gamma) absorbed dose in the host institution's neutron beam, following calibration of the chambers in a reference photon beam. The effects of differences in exposure standards, chamber responses in the neutron beams and protocol-dependent dosimetry factors were all investigated. It was concluded that the overall difference in the measurement of absorbed dose relative to that determined by the Clatterbridge group was less than 2%.\r"

For the early epithelial reaction, i.e. moist desquamation, the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the neutron beam increased with the decreasing size of the X-ray dose/fraction. There was an experimentally observed upper RBE value of approximately 2.75 for X-ray doses/fraction of between 2 and 5 Gy. For the late reaction of ischaemic dermal necrosis the RBE was greater than 3.0 for X-ray doses/fraction of less than 3 Gy and, based on the assumptions made in the linearquadratic model of cell survival, an upper limiting RBE of 4.32 +/- 0.39 was calculated for infinitely small doses/fraction. These findings were compared with other radiobiological data and the conclusions drawn from the results of clinical trials. It was concluded that for the sparing of late effects in skin and subcutaneous tissues, relative to acute reactions, a relatively small number of fractions in a short overall treatment time may be optimal for fast neutron therapy.\r"

The measurement of magnesium and trace element levels has been considered useful in the elucidation of the mechanism of stone formation and the evaluation of factors leading to pathological consequences. In this study, the Mg, Zn, Cu, Fe, Cd and Pb content in all of the samples was determined and an attempt was made to compare the levels of these elements in calculi with the levels in normal hair.\r"

Percutaneous nephrostomy was also performed on the last consecutive 7 patients 4 weeks before definitive treatment and the function of the kidneys determined daily. The patients were re-evaluated 2 months after the relief of obstruction. Ultrasonography, radionuclide imaging and CT scan were not found to be reliable in predicting whether these kidneys were potentially recoverable.

In this provisional study, conducted on 217 female patients, parameters such as the number and volume of the individual losses contributing to the total have been measured and related to the simultaneous pressure changes recorded during natural-filling urodynamic investigations. Each episode of incontinence can thus be attributed unequivocally to stress or to detrusor instability. This enables the quantified parameters of urine losses of both groups to be compared. The results indicate that interesting differences exist between the two types of incontinence, the recognition of which might be valuable for diagnostic purposes and for the design, development and suggested usage of incontinence aids.\r"

Diversion with a continent caecal reservoir was associated with fewer stoma-related problems and seemed to allow the patients greater freedom to continue activities such as sport, travel and social life. Sexual problems, disturbed relationships with partners and emotional and mental problems were common and did not differ between the two groups of patients. It is recommended that patients judged to be prone to mental and emotional disturbance after cystectomy should be identified pre-operatively and given extra psychological support.\r"

Comparison of DNA content was made with 36 benign prostates. Mean follow-up/survival was 60.7 months, at which time 21 patients had evidence of recurrence or had died. Only 5 patients had local recurrence. Tumour grade, as assessed by both the Gleason Sum Score and the MDAH system, correlated with anatomical extent and was the most important determinant of time to recurrence. Fifty-nine tumours were diploid, 44 tetraploid and 6 aneuploid. One of 36 benign prostates showed aneuploidy. Ploidy did not correlate with the anatomical extent of the tumour or with grade. Tetraploid tumours recurred earlier than diploid tumours. None of 6 aneuploid tumours have recurred, although only 3 have been followed beyond 5 years. Multivariate analysis showed that after accounting for grade, none of the other variables, including ploidy, contributed any additional significant prognostic information. Although the results must be regarded as preliminary, in view of the small number of patients with recurrence, they suggest that DNA content offers limited prognostic information in clinically localised prostate cancer.\r"

There were a further 25 cases notified but not due for delivery until early 1987; 10 of these were urological. Thirty-five cases (22%) notified proved postnatally to have normal urinary tracts and 21 (13.2%) had unsuspected urinary tract abnormalities. Of the 106 cases in which a suspected urinary tract abnormality was confirmed postnatally, confirmation was obtained at perinatal death in 32 and by ultrasound, radiographic and radioisotope investigation in the remainder; 34.5% of all urological cases registered and 75% of the confirmed survivors were treated surgically. The urological abnormality most frequently missed was posterior urethral valves. Attempts to diagnose the fetal sex were seldom made but when they were the prediction was usually male and usually correct. The perinatal mortality in this group was 0.43/1000 births, a contribution of nearly 4% to overall perinatal mortality in the Northern Region.\r"

No new sections were cut. There was disagreement with the original report of pT category in 14 cases: 13 were downstaged (including 6 from invasive to superficial) and 1 upstaged. There was disagreement with the original differentiation grade in 13 cases: 10 TCC were considered to be more differentiated and 3 less differentiated than the original report. A second pathologist reviewed the pT category only of 13 of the 14 cases, disagreeing with the original pT category on 8 occasions and with the pT category assigned by the dedicated pathologist on 7 occasions. These findings have important implications for advising patients on prognosis and clinical management and in the design and reporting of therapeutic trials.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and eighty-two patients with invasive (T2/T3) bladder cancer were treated by radical radiotherapy at the London Hospital between 1974 and December 1985. Cystectomy was reserved for patients whose tumours either did not respond completely to radiation or recurred later, provided they were fit for surgery and had not developed distant metastases. The overall corrected 5-year survival rate was 40%; 75 patients responded to radiation and did not relapse during the period of follow-up; 20 patients had an initial response to radiation but subsequently relapsed, with a 5-year survival rate following relapse of 20%. Of these, 11 patients had a cystectomy with a 5-year survival following relapse of 36%, whereas all 9 patients who did not have a cystectomy died within 3 years; 87 patients who did not respond to radiation had a 5-year survival rate of 18%. Of these, 22 patients underwent salvage cystectomy with a 5-year survival of 47%, whereas the 65 patients who did not have a cystectomy had a 5-year survival of 3%. These results justify a policy of radical radiotherapy and salvage cystectomy rather than elective cystectomy in the treatment of invasive bladder cancer.\r"

Fifty-eight patients had benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and 17 had prostatic carcinoma (CaP). In patients with BPH there was a statistically significant rise in PSA immediately following TURP. No such rise was seen in patients with prostatic carcinoma. A statistically significant correlation was identified between the weight of the benign hypertrophic prostate and the baseline pre-operative serum PSA. Because of the effects of TURP on serum PSA it is important to avoid PSA estimations immediately following such surgery. The failure of the malignant prostate to release PSA in significant amounts during TURP suggests that the elevated levels of PSA found in patients with prostatic carcinoma arise not from the local disease but from its metastases.\r"

Early and late effects of torsion on bilateral spermatogenesis were studied at 1 and 6 months in 10 groups each containing 20 rats. Gross and histological examination, direct immunofluorescence tests, vas deferens counts and copulation studies were performed. Severe ipsilateral damage was noted, even after brief torsion periods. No contralateral testicular effects, immunological or otherwise, were observed. Ipsilateral damage after torsion may have been underestimated. There is no damage to contralateral testicular exocrine function following unilateral experimental torsion.\r"

In order to investigate the way antibodies influence sperm function we studied serum and seminal plasma from patients with infertility (n = 61) or undergoing vasovasostomy (n = 25). These antisera were characterised to determine their TAT titre, the nature of the target antigens and their capacity to interfere directly with fertilisation. The results indicate that antibodies from both groups of patients exhibit a capacity to stimulate or suppress sperm/oocyte fusion. The proportion of samples showing stimulatory activity was higher (50%) in the vasovasostomised population than in patients with infertility (21%). The remainder of the antisera suppressed sperm/oocyte fusion. There was no correlation between the titre of antisperm antibodies and their capacity to influence sperm function, indicating that it is the nature of the target antigens which is of significance rather than the antibody concentration. Western blot analysis indicated that these antisera targeted a group of sperm surface antigens with molecular weights of 30kD (35,45,66,90 and 115kD). Monoclonal antibodies are now being prepared in order to determine which of these specific components are involved in the suppression of sperm function.\r"

There was good correlation between the length of vas excised and the resulting separation of the markers. In order to achieve a separation greater than that of sperm granulomas associated with vasectomy failure, at least 7 cm of vas would have to be removed. However, excision of this length cannot be recommended because of subsequent difficulties with vasovasostomy. It is suggested that as well as excising a length of vas during vasectomy, a second method is also used to prevent spontaneous recanalisation.\r"

More BScMed graduates than control subjects chose an academic career (49% v. 21%), achieved specialty certification (83% v. 65%), and obtained grants (51% v. 18%) and personal awards (37% v. 18%). The BScMed graduates also had significantly more publications than the control subjects. Although part of the difference between the two groups may be explained by the tendency of students who were more inclined toward an academic career to enter the BScMed program, it was evident that the program has a substantial effect on promoting the development of clinical investigators.\r"

Therapy consisted of a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1 through 5, every 2 to 3 weeks. Daily doses ranged from 5 micrograms/m2 to 200 micrograms/m2. Dose-limiting sequelae were hypotension, rigors, and phlebitis. Transient fatigue and fever (median, 38 degrees C) were not clearly dose-related between 5 micrograms/m2/d and 150 micrograms/m2/d. Other reversible complications in three patients included transient leukopenia (leukocyte count, 1.3, 1.2 X 10(3)/microliters in two patients) at a dose of 5 micrograms/m2/d and 150 micrograms/m2/d, respectively; and thrombocytopenia (leukocyte count, 73 X 10(3)/microliters) at 10 micrograms/m2/d. Among 22 patients with initial and subsequent differential counts, the median number of eosinophils at the commencement of therapy was 182 cells/microliters compared with a subsequent median of 462 cells/microliters. We also detected hypertriglyceridemia in all patients. The median baseline increased from 93 mg/dl (range, 56 to 219 mg/dl) to 203 mg/dl (range, 94 to 454 mg/dl). From our experience, a clinically manageable outpatient regimen for Phase II trials consists of rTNF-alpha (150 micrograms/m2) followed by a 1-hour IV infusion of 500 ml of normal saline to abrogate hypotension daily for 5 days every 2 weeks for four cycles, then every 3 weeks thereafter to facilitate recovery from constitutional sequelae.\r"

There was no significant deviation from the HLA-DR distribution observed in 160 normal patient controls, neither in the entire group nor in the patient groups with nonmedullary types of thyroid cancer (61 with papillary and 44 with follicular, all nonradiation associated). Also, subdivision of patients with nonmedullary thyroid cancer according to age at diagnosis, presence of metastases, and presence of thyroglobulin antibodies in serum showed no significant deviation from the HLA-DR distribution. For the patients with medullary thyroid cancer (only sporadic [n = 20] or inherited isolated [n = 2] forms, no multiple endocrine neoplasias), there was a significant increase of HLA-DR2 (11 of 22 cases [50%]) in comparison with control patients (22%; P corrected to 0.02; relative risk, 3.6). These data suggest, in contrast to previous reports, that there is no genetic influence on the development of nonmedullary types of differentiated thyroid cancer. Medullary thyroid cancer without multiple endocrine neoplasia, however, may be associated with HLA-DR2.\r"

  ".W": "From October 1977 to December 1983, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) levels were measured in 645 tumors from women with primary, unilateral, nonmetastatic breast cancer. All of them were treated surgically. Some received adjuvant radiotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or adjuvant hormonotherapy. A level of greater than 5 fmol/mg cytosolic protein was considered as positive for both ER and PR. Unifactorial analysis, using Kaplan and Meier estimates and the log-rank test, revealed that disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (SV) were both strongly related to age, tumor size, nodal status, nodal effraction, histopathologic grading (SBR), ER, and PR. Menopausal status and number of intramammary tumor foci were not significant. Multifactorial analysis, using Cox's model, revealed a strong relationship between SV and age (poor prognosis [pp]: less than or equal to 37 years old), menopausal status (pp: postmenopausal) tumor size, nodal status (pp: N+ greater than 3), nodal effraction, ER (pp: less than or equal to 5 fmol/mg), histopathologic grading (pp: SBR = 3), and PR (pp: less than or equal to 5 fmol/mg). Similarly, multifactorial analysis revealed a strong correlation between DFS and age, tumor size, nodal status, nodal effraction, histopathologic grading, and PR. A prognostic score taking into account these prognostic factors was calculated for DFS and SV. Analysis of this score allowed us to divide our patients into four significantly different (P less than 0.0001) groups with high, intermediate, and low risk of relapse. Our procedure was then validated using the sample test technique. These results show that both ER and PR have their own prognostic weight and should be considered, among other classic prognostic factors, when adjuvant therapies are indicated after surgical treatment of breast cancer.\r"

Hysterectomy and biopsy material from 21 patients 35 years of age or younger and from 18 patients age 50 years or older was studied. The DNA analysis was performed in nuclei isolated from specific areas of paraffin-embedded tissue. There were significant differences in the distribution of DNA patterns between the two age groups. About 80% of CIN III lesions in women 50 years of age or older, with or without a coexisting invasive cancer were aneuploid. In the group of younger women a diploid DNA pattern was found in about 60% of CIN III with concomitant invasive cancer. In the absence of an invasive cancer, CIN III lesions were mostly polyploid. The DNA pattern of invasive cancers was generally identical with the adjacent CIN, thus suggesting that the two lesions were related. Although the prognostic value of DNA ploidy measurements in cervical intraepithelial lesions in women in these two age groups has to be further evaluated, these results are at considerable variance with previously published data on DNA values in CIN and invasive carcinoma. In four CIN III lesions without invasive cancer, in women of the group of 35 years of age or younger, human papilloma virus common antigen could be demonstrated by immunochemical procedure. In three of these cases a polyploid DNA pattern was present; the fourth case showed a bimodal aneuploid pattern.\r"

The enzymatic procedure employed in this study allows the systematic determination of the NSE and of the nonneuronal enolase (NNE), thus permitting the calculation of the ratio of the two enolase components. Like results obtained with other procedures, enzymatic determined serum NSE results were raised in a high proportion of Stage IV neuroblastoma (100%) but elevated values also were found in a considerable number of the other tumors (29.2%) like Wilms' tumor, lymphomas, and soft tissue sarcomas. The use of the NSE/NNE ratio which characterizes NSE elevations originating from relative poor or rich sources of NSE, represents an additional index for improving the specificity of the NSE results in the diagnosis of neuroblastomas. With a cutoff value fixed at 7.5%, the specificity of the test is 85.9%. When this limit is fixed at 15%, the specificity reaches 95.3% whereas 81.8% of the results of Stage IV neuroblastomas are still above this value.\r"

The decreased aldolase B levels observed in cancer patients were unrelated to the clinical stage of their disease. The decrease of aldolase B correlated well with the decrease of fructose-1-phosphate (F1P)-aldolase activity, but not with fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP)-aldolase activity in the sera of cancer patients. Mixing experiments did not identify an inhibitor of aldolase B in sera of cancer patients. Furthermore, recovery of serum aldolase B levels after successful surgical resection in cancer patients suggested that the low levels of aldolase B in sera of cancer patients was not of genetic origin. The mechanism responsible for the decrease of aldolase B in sera of cancer patients is unclear.\r"

The mean (+/- SE) ratio of effusion/serum ferritin in Groups I, II, and III was 0.7 +/- 0.1, 2.7 +/- 0.7, and 5.7 +/- 1.2, respectively. The specificity and predictive value of a ferritin ratio in excess of 1.5 in distinguishing transudates from all exudates and in distinguishing transudates from malignant exudates were both very high (94%) to 96%). In the lower range of values considerable overlap existed between ferritin ratios obtained in patients with benign versus malignant inflammatory exudates. However, very high ferritin levels (greater than 3000 ng/ml) and ferritin ratios (greater than 20:1) were only encountered in malignant exudates. These results indicate that the measurement of ferritin levels and ferritin ratios may be a useful aid in the diagnosis of malignant pleural and peritoneal effusions.\r"

The overall incidence of DNA aneuploidy in the 42 cases examined was 80%, and the DNA index (DI) ranged from 0.825 to 2.170. However, intratumoral differences in DNA ploidy were observed in six of 15 cases (40.0%) of gastric carcinoma, whereas intratumoral differences in DNA ploidy were observed in only two of 27 cases (7.4%) of colorectal carcinoma. Therefore, to accurately determine DNA ploidy, one must analyze multiple samples from the tumor specimen (especially in gastric carcinomas) because cases exist where subpopulations with DNA aneuploidy are detected only at limited sites within the same tumor. The exact mechanisms responsible for the regional differences in DNA ploidy are not yet clear, although some hypotheses have been presented.\r"

The glandular cells of the normal cervix and microglandular hyperplasia always exhibited reactivity with anti-CA 125 in the luminal surfaces and the secretory products within the lumina, but there was usually no reactivity with either anti-CEA or anti-CA 19-9. In the neoplastic glandular cells (adenocarcinoma in situ and invasive adenocarcinoma), the reactivity with anti-CA 125 was negative or was not in the luminal surface, but in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm as accumulations of atypical coarse granules. In addition, the positive reaction with anti-CEA and anti-CA 19-9 was seen in 78% and 0% of adenocarcinomas in situ, in 80% and 40% of adenocarcinomas less than 5 mm in depth, and in 84% and 56% of frankly invasive adenocarcinomas, respectively. Therefore, neoplastic cervical glandular cells show an unusual staining pattern with anti-CA 125, which may be associated with impaired production and/or the intracytoplasmic transport of CA 125, and they begin to produce antigens recognized by anti-CEA and/or anti-CA 9-9, which are usually negative in the normal tissue.\r"

Thirty-nine (42%) of the FNA were positive for malignancy with no false-positive diagnoses. In 15 cases the FNA provided the initial diagnosis of cancer and in 24 cases documented recurrence. Five (5%) of the FNA interpreted as suspicious for malignancy were subsequently proven malignant by biopsy. There were 33 (36%) negative FNA with seven false-negative diagnoses confirmed by biopsies. Fifteen FNA (16%) were unsatisfactory and malignancy was found by biopsy in two of these cases. These results emphasize the importance of repeating the FNA or recommending biopsies in negative and unsatisfactory FNA when clinically indicated to assure accuracy in diagnosis. A positive FNA may be regarded as a definitive diagnostic test and treatment instituted accordingly. No complications resulted from these FNA. This study demonstrates the application, safety, and accuracy of FNA in these anatomic sites.\r"

Using a prospective longitudinal research design, patients were interviewed both before and after each chemotherapy infusion. Fifty-seven percent of the patients developed AN. These patients were characterized by more severe gastrointestinal side effects following the initial infusion and greater expectations for experiencing chemotherapy-related nausea. A more rapid development of AN was related to a history of experiencing nausea across a greater variety of situations, higher IV drug doses, and less infusion-related anxiety at the initial infusion. Although AN occurred intermittently across treatment sessions, severity was constant. Results provided strong support for the hypothesis that classical conditioning processes are instrumental in AN acquisition. The role of anxiety in the development of AN is considered as are clinical implications for the prevention of AN and recommendations for future research.\r"

Within a 9-month follow-up period, all patients were symptom-free, and none of the specimens obtained by endometrial biopsy showed the presence of adenomatous hyperplasia. These findings suggest that danazol has a potential application in the treatment of patients with endometrial adenomatous hyperplasia. A possible mechanism of action of the compound in adenomatous hyperplasia is also discussed.\r"

Data have accumulated to associate this procedure with an adverse risk of distant spread and death for a defined subset of patients with moderate and poorly differentiated, T3 and T4 (Stage C) tumors. Review of available literature demonstrates that examination of this subset is incomplete in studies that do not find an adverse prognosis. The reason for the association of TURP and metastasis may be related directly to the resection via mechanical dissemination of tumor or indirectly through association with unknown adverse factors. Retrospective review may be unable to separate these two hypotheses, but hazard function analysis is presented and is consistent with surgical enhancement of metastases. Strategies for avoiding the adverse effect represent areas for possible further clinical research.\r"

No significant differences were found in the plasma levels of the other mineral elements examined, including zinc, copper, and magnesium. Within a high EC rate area occupants of households with previously recorded EC cases had significantly (P less than 0.0025) lower levels of Se (64 ng/ml), but not of other mineral elements, than subjects from households without known cases (77 ng/ml). Mean Se levels of subjects with premalignant or malignant esophageal cytological changes (54 ng/ml) were significantly (P less than 0.0025) lower than those of subjects without such lesions (68 ng/ml). An inverse relationship was found between Se status and the degree of cytologic abnormality. These findings suggest that Se deficiency may play a role in the development of EC. The potential value of whole blood Se determinations and esophageal cytologic examinations in the early detection and of Se supplementation in the prevention of EC merits further investigation.\r"

The study reported in this article assessed the prevalence of anticipatory symptoms in 121 patients receiving parenteral chemotherapy over a 7-week period. The overall prevalence rate of 33% for anticipatory symptoms was not significantly different from the previous study or other investigations. Length of postchemotherapy nausea was significantly related to the report of anticipatory symptoms. However, the severity of symptoms reported in the investigation was mild. The prevalence in patients on adjuvant therapy for breast cancer was also significantly reduced from the previous investigation. It is concluded that although anticipatory symptoms commonly occur they are only rarely clinically significant.\r"

  ".W": "To unravel sequential morphological features in infarct-related coronary arteries (IRCA), we performed coronary angiography (CAG) before, during, and immediately after intracoronary urokinase infusion in 43 consecutive patients. After 1 month of rigorous anticoagulation by intravenous heparin and subsequent oral warfarin or after the same period of treatment by antiplatelet agents, we repeated CAG in all patients except for one, who died 6 days after thrombolytic therapy. Thirty-two IRCAs were totally occluded, and 11 were severely occluded at baseline. With recanalization and/or reduction in luminal narrowing at the site of the occlusion by progressive removal of the overlying thrombus and plaque content, we recognized the development of extraluminal contrast pooling in an ellipsoid shape (type A), single or paired linear radiolucency(ies) with or without outpouching (type B), and definite outpouching (type C). The development of type A, B, and C lesions occurred in 4, 6, and 0 IRCAs immediately after thrombolytic therapy and in 0, 18, and 3 IRCAs 1 month later, respectively. Throughout the study, at least one of type A-C lesions developed in 23 of 43 (53.5%) IRCAs. Lesion development proceeded from total or severe occlusion to type A, then to type B or C, both accompanied by progressive reduction in luminal narrowing and frequent enlargement of outpouching. A postmortem study in one patient whose CAG immediately after thrombolytic therapy was interpreted as a type B lesion demonstrated a ruptured plaque with paired ridges. Serial observations in vivo indicate that many IRCAs are associated with a complex underlying spatial structure, probably composed of some part of ruptured atheromatous plaque with or without adherent thrombus. Recognition and identification of such complex structures beneath the accumulated thrombus are of great importance in both CAG interpretation and elucidation of the pathophysiological sequence of acute myocardial infarction in vivo and may enable prevention or more effective therapy of acute coronary events.\r"

To determine whether coronary angioplasty improves survival, 87 patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, from 1975 to 1985 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients in group 1 (n = 59) were treated with conventional therapy; patients in group 2 (n = 24) were treated with conventional therapy and angioplasty. Extent of coronary artery disease, infarct location, and incidence of multivessel disease were similar between groups. Hemodynamic variables including cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were also similar. The 30-day survival was significantly improved for group 2 patients (50% vs. 17%, p = 0.006). Survival in group 2 patients with successful angioplasty was 77% (10 of 13 patients) versus 18% (two of 11 patients) in patients with unsuccessful angioplasty, (p = 0.006). The findings suggest that angioplasty improves survival in cardiogenic shock compared with conventional therapy with survival contingent upon successful reperfusion of the infarct-related artery.\r"

We sought to determine the accuracy with which a rapid rise in plasma [Mb] could predict successful coronary artery reopening in patients undergoing coronary arteriography in conjunction with attempted reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction. In 42 patients, plasma Mb levels were measured before and for at least 4 hours after attempted reperfusion. Thirty-five patients were successfully reperfused. In each, the plasma Mb level rose rapidly with peak [Mb] occurring at 111 +/- 8.1 (+/- SEM) minutes after application of therapy. In contrast, Mb levels rose more slowly in the seven patients who were not reperfused, with peak [Mb] occurring 360 +/- 61.4 minutes after attempted reperfusion. T25-100 (the time required for [Mb] to rise from 25% to 100% of peak value) was shorter in patients successfully reperfused (71 +/- 7.9 minutes) and longer (341 +/- 35.3 minutes) in patients in whom therapy was unsuccessful. A rapid rise in [Mb] after successful reperfusion was also evident by a more than 4.6-fold rise in [Mb] over the first 2 hours after reperfusion in all but five patients; in contrast, [Mb] rose by less than 4.6-fold over this same interval in every patient not successfully reperfused (sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 100%; predictive accuracy, 88%). We conclude that a rapid rise in plasma Mb level over the initial 2 hours after attempted reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction provides a useful index of successful reperfusion.\r"

This study included all patients referred for clinical reasons to the Long Beach Veterans Administration Medical Center treadmill laboratory and then followed for a 2-year period for cardiac events. The population consisted of 2,036 patients who underwent testing from April 4, 1984, to May 7, 1987, 131 of whom exhibited exercise-induced hypotension (6.4%). We found that exercise-induced hypotension is usually related to myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction, is best defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure during exercise below the standing preexercise value, and indicates a significantly increased risk for cardiac events (3.2-fold, p less than 0.005). This increased risk was not found in those having no previous myocardial infarction or no signs or symptoms of ischemia during the exercise test, and the increased risk was also not found in those undergoing a treadmill test within 3 weeks after a myocardial infarction. Exercise-induced hypotension appeared to be reversed by revascularization procedures, but confirmation of a beneficial effect on survival requires a randomized trial. The clinical importance of this study is that we have demonstrated that a drop in systolic blood pressure below standing preexercise values during treadmill testing indicates an increased risk for cardiac events except in certain subsets of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Although left ventricular thrombi that form acutely after myocardial infarction frequently resolve spontaneously or with anticoagulant therapy, the fate of left ventricular thrombi in patients with remote myocardial infarction or with idiopathic cardiomyopathy remains unknown. To determine the natural history of such chronic left ventricular thrombi, we performed serial echocardiograms on 51 patients with remote myocardial infarction (greater than or equal to 3 months; mean, 31 +/- 41 months) and on nine patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Mean follow-up was 24 +/- 22 months during which 3.5 +/- 1.4 echocardiograms were obtained. Studies were interpreted by blinded observers, and an increase or decrease of more than 5 mm in maximal thrombus thickness was defined as significant. Among all 60 patients left ventricular thrombi were unchanged in 24 (40%), completely resolved in 24 (40%), decreased in size in four (7%), increased in size in five (8%), and decreased and then increased in size in three (5%). Results in patients with remote infarction and idiopathic cardiomyopathy were similar. Warfarin therapy, which was at the discretion of the primary physician, was associated with a higher prevalence of thrombus resolution compared with no therapy (59% vs. 29%, p = 0.02). Definite systemic emboli occurred in seven patients (12%), all at times while they were not anticoagulated. Among the 48 thrombi that were present on two or more echocardiograms, changes in thrombus shape (classified as protruding or flat) occurred in only 16%, and changes in thrombus movement (classified as mobile or immobile) occurred in only 10%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nitrendipine reduced systolic and diastolic pressures from 145 +/- 4/95 +/- 3 to 119 +/- 3/78 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively, (p less than 0.001) through a fall in total peripheral resistance index (46 +/- 4 to 34 +/- 3 units/m2, p less than 0.001) without associated reflex cardiac stimulation. This antihypertensive effect was related directly to the height of pretreatment arterial pressure (r = -0.67, p = 0.006) but not to age or pretreatment plasma renin activity. Renal and forearm blood flow increased, vascular resistance decreased, and glomerular filtration rate remained stable. In addition, nitrendipine reduced left ventricular mass index (133 +/- 7 to 116 +/- 5 g/m2, p = 0.003) and wall thickness, changes that were accompanied by improvement in diastolic as well as systolic (ejection fraction and fractional fiber shortening rate) left ventricular functions. Intravascular volume did not expand with reduction in pressure. This study provides new information concerning the long-term hemodynamic effects and associated echocardiographic changes with nitrendipine. It also provides the first regional hemodynamic data in essential hypertensive patients detailing forearm and splanchnic changes and renal blood flow increase during prolonged treatment.\r"

Using visual inspection and manual calipers, four independent observers identified 131 stenoses in 18 patients with multivessel coronary disease. There was no difference in interobserver variability between Digital and Cine during multiple subgroup analyses. Overall, Digital yielded significantly greater estimates of stenosis severity than did either of two separate Cine observations (p less than 0.0001; average difference, 6.25%), but the differences fell below the level of statistical significance when only the group of stenoses 50% or greater were considered. Digital and Cine correlated well for the assessment of stenosis severity (r = 0.88), but linear regression comparisons of multiple subgroups consistently indicated modest overestimation of Cine by Digital. Smaller vessels, branch vessels, and mild lesions increased the likelihood of overestimation by Digital. Digital was highly sensitive for identification of clinically relevant stenoses, but less specific and less predictive than a second observation of Cine. Our results indicate that Digital and Cine are not interchangeable imaging techniques and that potential differences must be considered when Digital is used for clinical decision making.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the effects of dietary supplementation with cod-liver oil on impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations in hypercholesterolemia and in atherosclerosis in porcine coronary arteries. Sixteen male Yorkshire pigs underwent balloon endothelium removal of the left coronary arteries and were fed a 2% high-cholesterol diet for 10 weeks, with or without dietary supplementation of cod-liver oil (30 ml/day) (oil-fed and cholesterol-fed groups, respectively). This model allowed the simultaneous examination of the effects of dietary cod-liver oil on vascular reactivity in hypercholesterolemia alone (right coronary artery) and in atherosclerosis (left coronary artery). After 10 weeks of feeding, the dietary treatment with cod-liver oil caused an increase in plasma levels of eicosapentaenoic acid and a decrease in the plasma levels of arachidonic acid, whereas the treatment had no significant effect on the increases in plasma lipid levels induced by the high-cholesterol feeding. Morphometric analysis showed significant inhibition of coronary atherosclerosis by the treatment. Endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro in ring preparations and in bioassay experiments. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to bradykinin, serotonin, and adenosine 5'-diphosphate were larger in both right and left coronary arteries from oil-fed than from cholesterol-fed animals. Aggregating platelets from cholesterol-fed and oil-fed pigs induced comparable, larger endothelium-dependent relaxations in rings from oil-fed than from cholesterol-fed pigs. The contractions induced by serotonin or aggregating platelets were significantly inhibited in rings with endothelium from oil-fed pigs, whereas they were comparable in rings without endothelium in both groups. Relaxations to sodium nitroprusside and contractions to potassium chloride or serotonin were comparable in rings without endothelium in both groups. The bioassay experiments revealed that the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor in response to bradykinin and the relaxations of vascular smooth muscle to the endothelial factor were greater after the fish-oil diet. These results indicate that dietary supplementation of cod-liver oil delays the impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxations in hypercholesterolemia and in atherosclerosis, partly because of an improved release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor and partly because of an improved relaxation of coronary smooth muscle to the factor.\r"

  ".W": "The potential application of ultrasonic energy for ablation of atherosclerotic plaques was studied in human atherosclerotic arteries with continuous and pulsed delivery of energy. With a prototype ultrasonic wire probe (n = 79 segments), there was gross reduction in vascular lesions as well as microscopic disruption of fibrous and calcified plaques. Normal portions of vessels appeared unaffected by the application of ultrasound. The prototype ultrasonic wire catheter ablated calcific deposits in less than 10 seconds. With this probe, all 26 complete atherosclerotic occlusions 0.5-5 cm in length were recanalized irrespective of the presence of calcium. Twenty-four of the segments were reopened in less than 20 seconds. By light microscopy, the site of plaque ablation was smooth, concave, and conformed to the shape of the probe tip. In 17 samples, there was evidence of thermal injury, and in six of the 79 samples studied with the prototype probe, there was vascular perforation. No vascular perforation occurred without thermal damage, when pulsed (rather than continuous) ultrasonic energy was used (n = 40) or when the duration of application was less than 30 seconds, with power output less than 25 W and with the probe oriented parallel to the wall (n = 26). Thus, by modifying the duration, mode, and magnitude of the ultrasonic power output, thermal injury and vascular perforation may be avoided. In vivo intra-arterial ultrasonic angioplasty of a canine chronic femoral fibrocellular occlusion was also performed. A preliminary in vivo study demonstrated feasibility of the percutaneous application of intra-arterial ultrasonic recanalization. Thus, ultrasonic energy appears to have potential as a method for ablation of occlusive atherosclerotic plaque.\r"

  ".W": "Complement depletion with cobra venom factor (CVF) before coronary artery ligation has been previously shown to reduce subsequent ischemic myocardial tissue injury in the baboon; however, whether complement depletion after the initiation of acute myocardial ischemia affords similar myocardial preservation is not known. Both complement depletion with CVF or the administration of certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen, are thought to decrease myocardial infarct size by reducing polymorphonuclear leukocytic (PMN) infiltration; nevertheless, complement activation also could alter tissue injury by PMN-independent actions. Thus, the relative effects of CVF administered after coronary artery ligation on the subsequent development of myocardial tissue injury were assessed in a baboon myocardial infarction model. The animals were randomized into three treatment groups (n = 6): either CVF (125 units/kg) or saline was given 30 minutes after coronary artery ligation, and ibuprofen (12.5 mg/kg) was administered 30 minutes and 4 hours after ligation. The extent of ischemic myocardial injury was assessed 24 hours later. Relative to saline-treated baboons, both CVF and ibuprofen reduced PMN infiltration (36 +/- 4 vs. 24 +/- 4 and 24 +/- 4 PMN/mm2, respectively; mean +/- SEM) and histological evidence of transmural myocardial infarction (100% vs. 47% and 53%, respectively) in electrocardiographically designated, expected infarct sites. In both saline- and ibuprofen-treated animals, there was extensive localization of C4, C3, and C5 in all infarct sites; in contrast, there was only C4 localization in the CVF-treated baboons. When expected infarct sites were assessed for creatine kinase content as an indicator of tissue injury, there was significantly less epicardial and endocardial creatine kinase depletion in the CVF-treated animals (31.7 +/- 5.6% and 39.3 +/- 4.8%) than in the saline-treated animals (54.1 +/- 5.4% and 59.0 +/- 4.7%; p = 0.012 and 0.011, respectively). The percent creatine kinase depletion in the ibuprofen-treated animals was intermediate between the two other groups. These results suggest that depletion of complement after coronary ligation has beneficial effects in reducing tissue injury that cannot be explained solely on the basis of reducing PMN infiltration into the ischemic myocardium.\r"

Accordingly, effects of reduction of left atrial load on the pressure-flow velocity relation were characterized in 10 anesthetized, closed-chest dogs during transient inferior vena caval occlusion by means of simultaneously recorded left atrial and left ventricular micromanometric pressure measurement and transesophageal Doppler echocardiograms. Within four or five beats after inferior vena caval balloon occlusion, left atrial loading was reduced as evidenced by a decrease in the slope of the left atrial v wave from 21 +/- 4 to 13 +/- 4 mm Hg/sec (p less than 0.001) and by a decrease in the first crossover point of left atrial and left ventricular pressures from 5.6 +/- 1.1 to 2.9 +/- 1.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). This decrease in left atrial loading resulted in reductions during early diastole of minimum left ventricular pressure (from 1.0 +/- 0.8 to -0.4 +/- 1.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), the maximum early forward (i.e., left atrial pressure greater than left ventricular pressure) transmitral pressure gradient (from 2.8 +/- 0.8 to 2.4 +/- 0.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.01); the slope of the rapid filling pressure wave (from 44 +/- 11 to 38 +/- 10 mm Hg/sec, p less than 0.025); and the area of the reversed (i.e., left ventricular pressure greater than left atrial pressure) transmitral pressure gradient (from 79 +/- 42 to 53 +/- 33 mm Hg.msec, p less than 0.05). During late diastole, both the heights and slopes of the left atrial and left ventricular a waves fell, resulting in a decrease in the maximum late transmitral pressure gradient (from 1.2 +/- 0.7 to 0.9 +/- 0.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Vena caval occlusion also altered Doppler transmitral velocity profiles during both the early and late phases of diastole. Peak velocity of the E wave decreased (from 50 +/- 11 to 41 +/- 7 cm/sec, p less than 0.01) as did acceleration (from 880 +/- 222 to 757 +/- 258 cm/sec2, p less than 0.025) and deceleration (from 597 +/- 260 to 429 +/- 197 cm/sec2, p less than 0.025). Peak velocity of the A wave also fell (from 29 +/- 9 to 22 +/- 5 cm/sec, p less than 0.005).

In terms of cardiac electrophysiology, amiloride prolongs action potential duration without alteration in upstroke velocity of phase 0 in Purkinje fibers. The antiarrhythmic efficacy of amiloride was assessed in a model of inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 16 dogs late after 2-hour occlusion-reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Sixteen animals were studied: Four were randomly assigned to placebo, and 12 were assigned to amiloride treatment. Prolonged loading and maintenance infusions were designed to produce amiloride concentrations over the range achievable in humans. Animals were chronically instrumented to allow electrophysiological measures of conduction and refractoriness in the left ventricular infarct and border zones. Of the 12 animals treated with amiloride, six responded with inability to induce ventricular tachyarrhythmias, whereas of the four animals treated with placebo, none responded. The mean infarct size of the six animals responding to amiloride (12 +/- 5%) was significantly less than that of the six animals not responding to amiloride (20 +/- 8%). Overall, the only electrophysiological effect of amiloride observed in this study was prolongation of border zone ventricular refractoriness. This electrophysiological effect was accentuated in animals responding to amiloride. In addition, when animals were subdivided into responders, partial responders, or nonresponders, the border zone repolarization time was prolonged in responders and partial responders, whereas this measure shortened in nonresponding animals. Amiloride has antiarrhythmic activity in the suppression of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias in this postinfarction model.\r"

  ".W": "We developed a computer model of the interaction of impulse propagation with anatomic barriers in uniformly anisotropic tissue. Its predictions were confirmed experimentally by using an in vitro cut to create a 6 X 1-mm anatomic barrier in 12 canine epicardial strips. The model predicted that long, thin barriers located parallel to the direction of impulse propagation would have little effect in delaying conduction regardless of the arrangement of cardiac fibers. In this situation, the mean experimental ratio of postcut to control conduction times across the barrier was 1.05:1.00 in 10 tissues. When impulses were proceeding perpendicular to an anatomic barrier, significant distal conduction delay was predicted and found to occur only when the conduction from pacing to recording sites was initially longitudinal to fiber orientation (mean experimental ratio, 2.34:1.00 in five tissues) but not transverse to fiber orientation (ratio, 1.08:1.00 in five tissues). We conclude that the direction of initial impulse propagation and the orientation of myocardial fibers have large effects on the degree to which anatomic barriers delay activation in cardiac tissue. These findings may have implications for the participation of anatomic barriers in reentrant circuits.\r"

Ischemia included acidosis (pH 6.7), hypoxia (PO2 = 10-25 mm Hg), hyperkalemia (10 mM K+), and either normal or elevated [Ca2+]o (2.7 or 10.8 mM). Control automatic rate and maximum diastolic potential were 18 +/- 2 beats/min and -94 +/- 1 mV, respectively. Simulated ischemia led to depolarization (to -60 +/- 1 mV), cessation of normal automaticity, and in 21% of fibers, bursts of an abnormal automatic rhythm. Phenylephrine, 5 X 10(-8) M, increased the incidence of the automatic rhythm during ischemia to 44%; this effect was blocked by prazosin but not by propranolol. During reperfusion after simulated ischemia at 2.7 mM [Ca2+]o, automatic rhythm and maximum diastolic potential returned toward control values; after simulated ischemia at 10.8 mM [Ca2+]o, automatic rates were greater than those seen after normal Ca2+ ischemia and were associated with sustained membrane depolarization. Phenylephrine (5 X 10(-8) M) at 2.7 mM [Ca2+]o rapidly restored membrane potential during reperfusion, an effect that was blocked by prazosin. At 10.8 mM [Ca2+]o, phenylephrine also restored membrane potential during reperfusion and blunted the increase in reperfusion rate induced by high [Ca2+]o alone. These effects were blocked by propranolol but not by prazosin. Our results show that the effects of phenylephrine on automatic rhythms during simulated ischemia are blocked by alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists and that rhythms occurring during reperfusion have alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor components.\r"

Approximately 64 degrees of rotation occurred at the atlantoaxial complex before sufficient narrowing caused spinal cord compression in the average specimen. An average of 63 degrees of rotation was required to cause facet dislocation. Most specimens examined had a posterior odontoid tilt up to 45 degrees and a facet angle between 1 degree and 29 degrees. Bilateral facet dislocation occurred at 63 degrees. Spinal canal narrowing to 1 cm occurred at 64 degrees. This narrowing would probably not damage the cord, which averages 1 cm in diameter; however, if the rotary motion of C1 and C2 progressed, cord damage could occur. Facet angles and posterior odontoid tilts that are not within the normal range indicate pathological changes.\r"

  ".W": "Of 2023 patients treated for acute spinal injuries, 729 sustained acute injuries in thoracic and lumbar regions; 295 surgically treated patients were reviewed for evidence of postoperative neurological complications. Of the 295 patients, 150 were intraoperatively monitored using somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP). Six patients (4%) revealed intraoperative deterioration of the SSEP; however, only one of the six revealed a new postoperative neurological deficit (0.7%). The remaining 145 patients were included in the unmonitored or wake-up test group in which ten (6.9%) demonstrated new postoperative deficits. Of the 11 patients with new postoperative neurological deficits, eight patients demonstrated motor weakness, two had radiculopathy, and one had bowel-bladder incontinence. The intraoperative use of SSEP was not able to identify subtle alterations in neurological function; however, due to early warning, SSEP appears capable of preventing profound surgically induced neurological alterations. A new protocol is designed for the management of intraoperative neurological deterioration as detected by SSEP.\r"

Ages in all three groups were categorized into premenopausal (25-44 years), perimenopausal (45-54 years), and postmenopausal (55-84 years). The results showed higher scoliosis morbidity in the US compared to the SS populations. The prevalence and severity of osteoporosis were markedly increased in US versus SS populations. Femoral neck density determined by dual-photon absorptiometry techniques averaged 26% to 48% lower in all age categories of US patients compared to controls. These changes were found in the youngest age groups, indicating reductions in bone mineral content earlier in the adult life of white women with a specific type of high-morbidity US characterized by the marker of lateral spondylolisthesis.\r"

Thirty of these patients (30 hips) were treated with revision operations for either failed cup arthroplasty (ten hips), failed endoprosthesis (six hips), or failed total hip arthroplasty (14 hips) and presented difficult problems for acetabular reconstructions. Although none of the hips required reoperations for acetabular loosening, three patients showed roentgenographic evidence of acetabular component migration, and three others showed signs of impending failure of fixation of the acetabular component. The overall mean Harris hip rating improved from a mean of 43 points preoperatively to 87 points at follow-up evaluations. The extent of bone loss in the central acetabular region had the greatest influence on the results of acetabular fixation at the follow-up evaluation. None of the hips with intact medial acetabular cortex had roentgenographic evidence of failure of fixation, while 14% of the hips with medial cortical defects measuring less than 1 cm, and 75% of the hips with larger defects developed acetabular component loosening. The results of total hip reconstruction using acetabular mesh were unsatisfactory in patients with moderate or severe central acetabular bone loss and defects through the medial wall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Simple neurolysis was performed in 12 cases, in which C5 and C6 were found to be in continuity; the operation resulted in useful motor function in nine of the 12 cases. A cause-and-effect relationship of neurolysis to the recovery of function was difficult to prove. In five cases where only one root was completely damaged, four nerve graftings produced useful motor results but the function of one graft was not demonstrable when the other root was in continuity. In 14 cases of complete lesions of both C5 and C6 treated by nerve grafting, there were seven functional motor results that were attributable to the grafts. Both the overall results and the result of elbow flexion were statistically correlated with the number of grafts used to repair the corresponding nerve structure (p less than 0.01). Favorable results were not obtained when the graft had been delayed for more than nine months. All of the patients who had nerve grafts within five months had favorable results.\r"

Various imaging modalities were necessary to demonstrate and localize these lesions.

The angulation of the fractures and of the epiphyseal plates was measured at the time of healing and at the follow-up examination. The patients were divided into three age groups of 0-5 years, 6-10 years, and 11-15 years at the time of fracture. In children younger than 11 years of age with residual angulation after distal forearm fractures, the change of orientation of the epiphyseal plate toward normal seemed to account for nearly all the actual correction at the site of fracture, up to 28 degrees. In children older than 11 years of age the capacity of correction of the orientation of the epiphyseal plate was preserved, but its influence upon the correction of distal forearm fractures decreased. This did not prevent correction of possible residual angulation at the fracture site--up to 18 degrees. This may be because, in this age group, appositional bone formation and resorption are the most important remodeling factors. The importance of the orientation of the epiphyseal plate is related to the distance between the fracture site and the epiphyseal plate and by the age of the patient.\r"

Early resolution of this was evident by nine months, and complete resolution was seen at the follow-up examination (four years and two months). Despite delay in treatment, this patient had full, pain-free wrist motion. Consequently, avascular changes of the carpus following wrist dislocation do not preclude a good result. Anatomic reduction of the scaphoid, as well as the midcarpal joint, and restoration of the articular surface of the lunate, are most important in determining prognosis.\r"

The technique was made in eight undamaged normal fresh knees from distal ischemic amputated lower limbs. In six knees the technique was successful. In two knees the presence of hypertrophic synovium impeded a good visualization and the technique failed.

In cases involving vascular injury, preoperative arteriography is indispensable. The blood supply must be reestablished and the brachial plexus completely explored and, if possible, repaired. In cases not involving vascular injury, violent trauma with fractures of the shoulder often produces lesions in the same brachial plexus. Regardless of associated vascular or bone injuries, brachial plexus lesions should be repaired within the first days after injury (provided that there are no contraindications related to age or general health). If combined vascular and nerve injuries are involved, immediate emergency surgery is mandatory. With early surgery, exploration is easier, shorter grafts are needed, and neurotization is possible in lesions in which the roots have been pulled out.\r"

To evaluate precisely the type and level of injury, the accuracy of these three techniques was compared with clinical and operative findings. The accuracy of myelography was considered good in 84% of the cases, but 4% were evaluated as false positive results and 12% as false negative or doubtful results. The combined CT scan and myelography reduced the number of doubtful results and accuracy reached 94.25%, but they did not visualize the roots distal to the spinal foramina. MRI correlated well with CT scan images and, in addition, offered visualization of distal radicular injuries. MRI seems a promising diagnostic procedure and should also help to situate nerve grafts and check their viability.\r"

The best results were obtained with surgery delayed four to five weeks, because the preoperative assessment of the lesion is more accurate after wallerian degeneration has occurred. In addition, formation of a proximal neuroma allows definition of the exact limits for resection. In cases with associated vascular damage, the vessels should be repaired at the same time as the nerve grafts unless there is severe ischemia. Intraspinal exploration with cervical laminectomy is not justified because intraspinal avulsion is always due to rootlet avulsion. Division of the clavicle to facilitate exploration of the anatomy of the plexus where it is the most complex is advocated. In general, distal grafting allows the recovery of a single function, which is preferable to an attempt at total anatomic repair. The adverse effects of contractions must be avoided. The priority of restoration of functions is an important consideration. Elbow flexion should be the first priority, followed by wrist extension, finger flexion, and shoulder abduction, in that order. The results of grafting may be improved by ancillary operations such as shoulder fusion, flexor tendon tenodesis, humeral derotation, and other procedures that provide limited function for patients with various incomplete and complete avulsions. Microsurgical repairs of brachial plexus lesions currently offer the best results for patients with this type of injury.\r"

  ".W": "The authors report their experience with 21 cases of neurotization via the spinal accessory nerve for multiple nerve root avulsion injuries of the brachial plexus associated with total paralysis of the upper limb. They performed microneuroanastomoses with interposed cable nerve grafts between the spinal accessory nerve taken in the supraclavicular fossa and the musculocutaneous nerve at its entrance into the biceps muscle. Surgical indications depend on the accurate diagnosis of spinal nerve root avulsion, especially C5. The anatomicosurgical basis of this technique is as precise as are the indications. As many as two-thirds of the patients with a neurotized musculocutaneous nerve can be expected to achieve strength of at least Grade 3 on late muscle testing. Nevertheless, these results are always inferior to those obtainable when grafting is performed with carefully selected unavulsed C5 or C6 spinal nerve root fibers in the intervertebral foramina. Therefore, neurotization via donor nerves extrinsic to the plexus should only be considered as a second-choice intervention.\r"

Neurotization of the musculocutaneous nerve with intercostal nerves or the spinal accessory nerve resulted in satisfactory elbow flexion in 21 of the 33 cases (64%). Combined nerve repairs (i.e., intercostal and spinal accessory neurotization of the terminal branch of the brachial plexus in combination with nerve grafts from the upper spinal nerves of the brachial plexus) created a useful function in at least one functional level of the upper limb for 11 of the 15 cases so treated. Nerve repairs resulted in stability of the shoulder and elbow function controllable with a sensible hand for patients with root avulsion injury of the brachial plexus.\r"

  ".W": "The author reviewed 420 adults treated with surgery for traumatic palsy of the brachial plexus. The results of 105 patients (25%) who suffered plexus injury behind or beyond the clavicula are presented. In 69 patients, lesions affected secondary trunks and in the other 36 affected terminal branches. Simultaneous fractures or vascular injuries were not uncommon and often influenced overall prognosis. Decision criteria for nerve grafting or neurolysis are presented. Surgery is generally performed three weeks to six months after injury. Most patients present extensive damage due to traction lesions. Although secondary sutures can be performed on some injuries, nerve grafting is usually necessary. Such a procedure depends on the length of the gap and the quality of surrounding tissues. Among distal lesions a distinction must be made between (a) injuries located close to effectors on axillary, suprascapular, musculocutaneous, or radial nerves where good recovery can be expected in 70% to 80% of grafted patients and (b) injuries involving lateral or medial cords or the median or ulnar nerves far from effectors, where results are less satisfactory. Sixty percent of such patients recovered wrist flexion but no intrinsic muscle function in the hand. Reinnervation nevertheless generally provided a protection sensibility particularly in the area controlled by the median nerve. Multiple injuries may occur, mainly posterior cord lesions combined with lesions of the musculocutaneous, median, or ulnar nerves. The overall prognosis of infra- or retroclavicular plexus injuries is nevertheless better than that of supraclavicular lesions.\r"

  ".W": "The treatment consisted of a free vascularized ulnar nerve graft in 63 patients with lesions of the supraclavicular brachial plexus. Since 1978, the outcome in 42 patients with a minimum follow-up period of 30 months was certainly better than with an avascular segment of ulnar nerve. Clear proof of hopeless prognosis for recovery along the course of the ulnar nerve is essential before using this graft. The early operations used the ulnar artery and accompanying veins as the pedicle for the graft; later a technique using collateral vessels in the arm has been favored. Although functional elbow flexion has been regained in the majority of patients, recovery of function into the hand has been disappointing. Although it cannot be proved that results are better than when conventional sural nerve grafts are performed, the authors believe that this is the case. The vascularized ulnar nerve graft (VNG) is indicated in more severe injuries of the brachial plexus, where preganglionic injury to the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves is proven, where the gap between nerve stumps is long, and when the presence of two or three proximal stumps allows the opportunity for extensive repair.\r"

Patients with fever or duration of symptoms greater than 24 hours, or ileo-ileocolic type of intussusception had a significantly greater rate of unsuccessful hydrostatic reduction (p less than 0.001). Of 48 cases of intussusception hydrostatically reduced by barium enema, 47 patients received repeat physical examination after reduction, 45 having normal findings. Oral feeding was tolerated in these 47 patients within 12 hours after reduction. All 41 hospitalized patients were discharged within 24 hours of reduction without developing complication; of seven non-hospitalized patients, six reported no complications during the initial 24 hour post-reduction period. The single complication that occurred was recurrence of intussusception (ileo-ileocolic type) in a patient 6 hours after initial reduction; this was the only case in which neither post-reduction physical examination nor trial of feeding had been performed. Children with intussusception hydrostatically reduced by barium enema are at low risk for complication during the subsequent 24 hour post-reduction period. When the pre-reduction course has been relatively uncomplicated, the post-reduction physical examination does not reveal abnormalities, and the patient is able to tolerate oral feeding, close outpatient monitoring appears to be safe.\r"

NSAIDs had significant inhibitory effects on erythema induced by all 4 substances tested and on edema induced by methyl nicotinate. The inhibition was probably due in part to percutaneous absorption and systemic effects of NSAIDs.

In the cosmetic series, only Kathon CG elicited positive patch test reactions (n = 3). Cosmetic allergy was considered to be \"proven\" in 3 patients (2.0%), and \"possible\" in 7 (4.7%). It is concluded that contact allergy is responsible for a minority (less than 10%) of all reactions to cosmetics and toiletries. The majority of reactions are due to irritation from personal cleanliness products such as soaps, shampoos, bath foams and from deodorants, or worsening of pre-existing dermatoses such as seborrhoeic dermatitis and acne.\r"

A relationship does exist between the daily oral intake of nickel and its clinical manifestations, but it is not uniform and depends on the changing quantities and, above all, on the manner of intake. It would seem that a 10 mg NiSO4 oral challenge represents a sudden and large intake of the element to which the majority of sensitized subjects are not able to adapt. On the other hand, a gradual intake permits a majority of subjects to adapt to the element.

The skin temperature of the fingers and palms of the hands ranged from 17 degrees C to 20 degrees C, while the temperature on the backs of the hands and forearms ranged from 25 degrees C to 30 degrees C. Skin temperatures less than 20 degrees C abolish itch and reduce vasodilation by half.

One hundred thirty-eight (10.4%) patients bled after ICU admission, and an additional 388 (29.2%) bled coincident with admission. The upper GI tract was the site of bleeding in 34.8% of patients whose bleeds commenced in the ICU, and accounted for 22% of total sites. Patients with clinical bleeding after ICU admission had a significantly (p less than .001) higher likelihood of death than those who did not bleed, and those with multiple bleeding sites had a higher mortality (54.9%) than those with single sites (31%) (p less than .006). Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that risk ratios (RR) for bleeding after ICU admission were mechanical ventilation (RR = 1.82), nutritional failure (RR = 3.45), acute renal failure (RR = 3.36), antiulcer medication (RR = 3.36), and anticoagulants (RR = 4.19). No antibiotics could be specifically incriminated. This study defines the scope, characteristics, and importance of bleeding in ICU patients and establishes risk factors.\r"

The branch-chain algorithm primarily focuses on priorities, order of procedures, and the immediate therapeutic options. The algorithm was used to track clinical management of 280 consecutive patients with penetrating truncal injuries; 31 were dead on arrival, 12 were alive on admission but died during their hospitalization. Of 209 patients whose management was in satisfactory compliance, four (2%) died; eight (20%) of 40 patients who had major deviations from the algorithm died (p less than .01).\r"

The basic hypothesis of this study is that criteria organized into a prioritized decision tree can provide objective standards to evaluate the quality of trauma care and to compare alternative approaches. The algorithm was designed to provide prompt therapy for the most life-threatening problems: respiratory and cardiac arrest, shock, head injury, tamponade, lacerations of the great vessels, cardiac contusion, ruptured parenchymal organs, lacerated viscera, and injury to other intraperitoneal organs. Resuscitation from shock, correction of circulatory problems, and monitoring of physiologic variables were prioritized to evaluate the presence of circulatory deficits and the adequacy of specific therapy to correct them. Concomitantly, diagnosis of the underlying problems was approached using peritoneal lavage, abdominal and chest x-rays, iv urograms, cystograms, endoscopy, upper and lower GI barium or hypaque studies, ultrasound, scintograms, and CT scans. In emergency conditions these are limited to a large extent by time factors. The diagnostic accuracy, priorities, and limitations of each of these were evaluated in emergency conditions. The algorithm was used to track management decisions in a prospective series; the mortality of 51 patients with satisfactory compliance was 4% and 44% in nine patients with major deviations from the algorithm.\r"

Although described in adults, this syndrome has not been well defined in pediatric patients. We report 22 children who developed ischemic hepatitis during an acute illness. Fifteen of 22 patients had a documented hypotensive episode or no cardiac output before the onset of the ischemic hepatitis episode. Four of the seven patients without documented hypotension required pressor therapy to maintain their BP. SGOT showed a marked rise (mean 2294 IU/L, range 438 to 6652) from admission to 96 h (mean 34) with a rapid decline to near normal levels within 9 days (mean 5.1). Serum bilirubin levels also rose transiently, but generally not to the extent of transaminase levels. A clinically significant coagulopathy occurred in six patients. Although nine patients expired, none died as a direct result of the hepatic damage. Ischemic hepatitis can occur during illnesses associated with diminished hepatic blood flow and follows a characteristic course that usually can be differentiated from viral or drug-induced hepatitis on clinical and biochemical criteria.\r"

Mean score for survivors was higher than for nonsurvivors (24.5 +/- 6.7 vs. 20.7 +/- 5.7, p less than .01), and increasing APACHE II scores were not associated with increasing mortality. Mortality was 54% for APACHE II scores less than or equal to 18, 43% for scores greater than 18 and less than or equal to 24, 22% for scores greater than 24 and less than or equal to 31, and 25% for scores between 32 and 40. The relationship of APACHE II scores to mortality did not improve when the 25 patients with ICU stays less than 48 h were analyzed; the mean score of survivors in this group was 24.3 +/- 5.2 vs. 18.8 +/- 4.6 for nonsurvivors, p less than .001. The presence of myocardial infarction (MI) was associated with a high mortality. Mortality in the 51 MI patients was 52.9% vs. 13.5% in the 37 patients without MI (p less than .001), but APACHE II scores were similar (22.6 +/- 6.6 and 23.7 +/- 6.4, respectively). The relationship between APACHE II scores and mortality did not improve if patients with and without MI are analyzed separately. For patients with MI, mortality was 78.6% for scores between 12 and 17, 56.2% for scores between 18 and 23, 33.3% for scores between 24 and 29, and 33.3% for scores greater than 29.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fifty-nine surgical patients were studied on ICU admission. The stomach wall pH was calculated from the PCO2 in gastric juice and arterial bicarbonate concentration using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. A fall in tissue pH less than 7.32 was taken as an indication of inadequate tissue oxygenation. Patients with sepsis scores greater than 10 were considered septic. Hospital and short-term (within 72 h of admission) mortality rates were determined. A significantly higher short-term mortality rate was observed in patients having a pHi less than 7.32 (37% vs. 0%, p less than .005). Most (90%) of the septic patients had a pHi less than 7.32. The short-term mortality rate was the highest (50%) in the septic group. In this group also, a linear correlation was found between pHi and the sepsis score (r = -.43, p less than .01). Gastric pHi, however, offered no prediction for the long-term outcome.\r"

A specific thromboxane A2-mimetic, U46619, was infused into six normoxic, sedated, mechanically ventilated lambs. U46619 produced pulmonary hypertension which was significantly attenuated during respiratory alkalosis. These results support the use of respiratory alkalosis to treat infants and children with pulmonary hypertension regardless of the presumed etiology.\r"

Intravascular pressure, hemodynamic and oxygen transport variables were measured simultaneously. PtcO2 and PcjO2 closely paralleled PaO2 during normoxia, hyperoxia, and hypoxia over a wide range of arterial oxygen tensions. PtcO2 was reliable over the widest range of PaO2, with a correlation coefficient of .94. The PcjO2/PaO2 index fell at very low PaO2. The PscO2/PaO2 index decreased at both very low and very high PaO2. Only minor changes were found in hemodynamic and oxygen transport variables during hyperoxia. During hypoxia, however, cardiac output and other central hemodynamic measurements increased, while PscO2, PtcO2, and PcjO2 fell. Oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption were maintained or only slightly changed during hypoxia. All three continuous measurements of oxygen tension are reliable indices of PaO2 over a wide range under normovolemic conditions. The instruments for measuring PscO2 and PcjO2 are unheated and therefore may have advantages for human application.\r"

This study examined the influence of varying FIO2 on pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances (PVR, SVR), cardiac output, ventricular work, and regional blood flows in ten anesthetized Yorkshire white pigs. Each animal served as its own control, and was exposed to varying FIO2 in random order. PCO2 was maintained at 40 +/- 5 torr and body temperature at 38.5 degrees C. Heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, thermodilution cardiac output, and blood flows in the femoral, carotid, renal and superior mesenteric arteries were measured at each FIO2. SVR, PVR, left and right ventricular stroke work (LVSW, RVSW) were calculated. One-way analysis of variance-randomized block design (F-test) showed significant decreases in PAP, PVR, and RVSW with increased FIO2. No change was noted in regional flows, cardiac output, SVR, or LVSW. We conclude that in this animal model administration of oxygen up to an FIO2 of 1.0 had no adverse effect on hemodynamic performance.\r"

  ".W": "Measurement of intrapulmonary shunting (Qsp/Qt), a widely used method for monitoring disturbances of pulmonary oxygen transfer in critically ill patients, involves calculation of arterial and mixed venous oxygen contents. In circumstances where mixed venous blood samples are not readily available, oxygen tension-based indices such as the alveolar to arterial oxygen tension differences (P[A-a]O2), arterial oxygen tension to alveolar oxygen tension ratio (PaO2/PAO2), PaO2 to FIO2 ratio (PaO2/FIO2) and respiratory index (RI) are widely utilized to reflect Qsp/Qt. Oxygen content-based indices such as the estimated shunt are not as widely utilized as the oxygen tension indices. In 75 critically ill patients in whom a pulmonary artery catheter was being utilized to augment clinical care, comparisons were made between Qsp/Qt and P(A-a)O2, PaO2/PAO2, PaO2/FIO2, RI, and estimated shunt to determine which index best reflected Qsp/Qt. Correlations between Qsp/Qt and estimated shunt were good (r = .94) and poor for the P(A-a)O2 (r = .62), PaO2/PAO2 (r = .72), PaO2/FIO2 (r = .71), and RI (r = .74). We conclude that there are no real substitutes for venous oxygen contents in critically ill patients. When pulmonary artery blood is not available for analysis, oxygen tension-based indices are unreliable reflectors of Qsp/Qt while the estimated shunt, an oxygen content-based index, provides a more reliable reflection of Qsp/Qt.\r"

Nonpulsatile submucosal vessel dilatation, consistently seen in all patients and called the vessel dilatation score, was assessed visually by three independent bronchoscopists. The vessel dilatation score was correlated more closely with pulmonary artery wedge pressure (r = 0.687) (p less than 0.001) than to mean pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.531) (p less than 0.01) and right atrial pressure (r = 0.178) (NS). The vessel dilatation score decreased after reduction of the left atrial load by surgery. These results suggest that the dilated vessels observed in patients with mitral stenosis are bronchial veins that are engorged secondary to increased blood flow via bronchopulmonary anastomoses.\r"

We examined the S-100 protein labeling pattern in three cases of PEG and in a variety of controls. Non-Langerhans' histiocytes were labeled for lysozyme antigen on the same histologic sections using a combined ABC and PAP technique. This verified that the S-100 protein-negative histiocytes were indeed a separate population from the S-100 protein-positive histiocytes and did not represent Langerhans' cells which failed to label with antiserum to S-100 protein. This technique confirms the usefulness of S-100 protein staining in the diagnosis of PEG and offers a means to verify the reliability of the S-100 protein labeling in questionable cases.\r"

Objective evidence of improved functional ability, as measured by treadmill exercise testing and improved understanding of their disease, was demonstrated in 86 percent of patients who completed the program. An increased work load was performed at a lower heart rate and respiratory rate. Eleven of 41 patients reached anaerobic threshold at a higher work load. Most importantly, however, was improved quality of life. In follow-up of 101 patients from one to five years later, 31.7 percent remained improved, while 31.7 percent had died, and 36.5 percent were worse from progression of pulmonary or occurrence of other diseases. Outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation can be objectively shown to be an important therapeutic tool in the treatment of patients with pulmonary disease.\r"

There was, however, a weak but significant correlation between right ventricular ejection fraction and the pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.40, p less than 0.005). In 52 of these patients, 37 with pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular end-systolic volume index was 53 +/- 21 ml.m-2 and end-diastolic volume index was 86 +/- 27 ml.m-2, compared with a calculated mean of 33 ml.m-2 and 79 ml.m-2, respectively, for normal subjects. In 24 of these patients where the measurements were made at rest and on exercise, the mean right ventricular end-systolic volume increased from 66 +/- 20 ml.m-2 to 87 +/- 32 ml.m-2, with an increase in right ventricular systolic pressure from 28 +/- 9 mm Hg to 55 +/- 15 mm Hg. Analysis of the slope of the right ventricular end-systolic pressure volume relationship at rest and on exercise suggested relatively normal right ventricular contractility in the majority of patients. Thus, in these patients with stable COPD, despite the presence of pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular contractility remained relatively normal.\r"

In series 2, patients who fulfilled previously defined high-risk criteria were preoperatively randomized to one of three monitoring/treatment groups: CVP-control group, PA-control group and PA-protocol group. Postoperative mortalities in the CVP-control and PA-control groups were not statistically significantly different, but PA-protocol group mortality was significantly reduced compared with its control group. The PA-protocol group had reduced complications, duration of hospitalization, duration in ICU, and mechanical ventilation, and reduced costs when the PA catheter was placed preoperatively and used to augment circulatory responses.\r"

We hypothesized its cause to be spasm occurring simultaneously in the pulmonary vasculature and the digital arteries. We measured in this study the Dsb, the diffusing capacity of the pulmonary membrane (Dm), and the volume of blood in the pulmonary capillaries (Vc) after cold-induced digital vasospasm in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. Control subjects showed no significant decrease in Dsb, Dm, or Vc after cold exposure. Eight of 12 subjects with Raynaud's phenomenon had a significant decrease in Dsb 60 min after testing (25.3 +/- 6.6 vs 19.8 +/- 6.1 ml/min/mm Hg, p less than 0.01). The acute decrease in Dsb was due to a significant decrease in Vc (54 +/- 20 vs 39 +/- 10 ml, p less than 0.05), while Dm was unchanged (52 +/- 17 vs 51 +/- 20 ml/min). Four subjects who had a decrease in Dsb after cold challenge had repeated studies later after pretreatment with sublingual nifedipine. The magnitude of change in Dsb was similar to that observed in the untreated state (23.6 +/- 10.6 vs 20.9 +/- 9.6 ml/min/mm Hg). We conclude that digital vasospasm is accompanied by an acute reduction in Vc in both primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon and indicates concurrent vasoconstriction within the pulmonary vaculature.\r"

At five-year follow-up, all of the deaths (14) had occurred among those conservatively treated with weight-loss (a mortality rate of 11 per 100 patients per five years). These patents also had a higher five-year crude vascular mortality rate: 6.3 per 100 patients per five years, with an age-standardized vascular mortality rate of 5.9 per 100 patients per five years (95 percent confidence interval [CI] 2.5-11.6) vs 0 per 100 for the surgically treated population; this despite a lower mean apnea index (43 versus 69) and a lower mean body mass index (31 versus 34 kg/m2) in the conservatively treated group. With the fictional adjunction of one possible death at five-year follow-up in the surgically treated group, the age-adjusted odds of vascular mortality at five years for the conservatively treated group was 4.7. Our data therefore encourage \"aggressive\" treatment for patients with OSAS.\r"

No significant improvement was noted in initial spirometry in the MDI with InspirEase group. In spite of the superiority of nebulizer therapy in the initial phase of hospitalization, the daily rates of spirometric improvement and duration of hospitalization were not significantly different among the three groups.

In ten of the 22 patients transients of peak flow were generated during cough flow-volume maneuvers, indicating dynamic compression of the airways, which is considered important in the physiology of an efficient cough. Patients who could not generate peak flow transients had significantly reduced PEFR, FVC, and MEP values. Measurement of MEP was the most sensitive predictor of flow transient production during coughing; all of the patients who exhibited transients had MEP values of above 60 cmH2O, whereas the highest value of MEP recorded in patients without transients was 45 cmH2O. Three of the 12 patients who were unable to generate flow transients were considered to have an adequate cough by subjective assessment. We concluded that the measurement of MEP is extremely useful for assessment of cough strength in patients with MD.\r"

  ".W": "Although many of the pulmonary manifestations of tuberculosis in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are well known, endobronchial involvement has not been previously described. We report the clinical, roentgenographic, and bronchoscopic features of three patients with endobronchial tuberculosis and AIDS. All of the patients had nonspecific symptoms of fever and cough; however, none exhibited the classic findings of dyspnea, wheezing, or hemoptysis. Smears of sputum were nondiagnostic. The chest x-ray film revealed mediastinal adenopathy in two patients and a lower lobe consolidation in the third; all had small ipsilateral pleural effusions. Endobronchial lesions were white or pink exophytic masses obstructing the airways, mimicking bronchogenic carcinoma. Areas of \"classic\" primary tuberculosis were seen in two of the patients. Despite ongoing clinical and roentgenographic deterioration, all patients responded well to antituberculosis medications. Given the frequency of tuberculosis in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex, one should maintain a high index of suspicion for involvement of the tracheobronchial tree, so as to avoid a delay in diagnosis and resultant increased morbidity and mortality.\r"

We treated four of these stenoses by balloon angioplasty in three sessions. Pulmonary artery pressure was reduced from 90/25 mm Hg (mean 46) to 78/13 mm Hg (mean 35) with concomitant increase of aortic pressure from 105/60 mm Hg (mean 75) to 134/68 mm Hg (mean 90). Pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy showed increase of perfusion in the treated segments. Two procedures were followed by transient segmental pulmonary edema, but no other complications were noted. We conclude that balloon angioplasty is a promising method of lowering pulmonary artery pressure and improving pulmonary perfusion in suitable cases of pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary embolism.\r"

Several prediction equations were compared to the measured value of REE in a group of COPD patients with moderate to severe disease. Then, using the same group of patients, a new equation was derived by regression analysis and was prospectively tested on patients with similar characteristics. Equations derived from normal populations (Harris-Benedict, Wilmore nomogram) were shown to underestimate REE by 300-400 Kcal. Equations that use body weight as the only variable were found to be easier to use and did not appear to sacrifice accuracy. Quebbeman Ausman body weight, Quebbeman Ausman body surface area and a regression equation derived from COPD patients (males, REE = 11.5 x wt [kg] + 952; females, REE = 14.1 x wt [kg] + 515) performed better than other currently used equations. In both stable COPD and COPD with exacerbation, the mean predicted values fell within a standard deviation (+/- 167 Kcal) of measured values.\r"

We gave intermittent pulse supplemental oxygen to ten patients during 26 laser procedures performed under local anesthesia using SaO2 measured by a pulse oximeter as a guide. In four procedures (15.4 percent), severe oxygen desaturation contraindicated performing or completing laser phototherapy. In the remaining 22 procedures (84.6 percent), laser photoresection was safely and successfully performed without incident. Thus, pulse oximetry is a valuable tool and intermittent oxygen supplementation with pulse oximeter guidance an effective technique for maintaining adequate oxygenation during laser photoresection.\r"

These changes were focal and confined to small areas characterized histologically by aggregates of interstitial fibroblasts embedded within a myxoid stroma (fibroblastic foci). Ultrastructurally, the denuded epithelial basal lamina in these areas showed deep infoldings into the interstitium, and the luminal surfaces of the resultant clefts often were re-epithelialized. These findings suggest that the fibroblastic foci commonly seen in UIP represent sites of acute lung injury, and that alveolar collapse following epithelial necrosis is an important mechanism of lung remodeling. In addition to new insights regarding the pathogenesis of fibrosis in UIP, these observations may have important implications for assessing prognosis and selecting treatment strategies.\r"
