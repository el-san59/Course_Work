  ".W": "The effects of aging on pituitary GH, PRL, and alpha-tubulin messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured in 3-, 12-, and 27-month-old male C57BL/6J mice by dot-blot hybridization. The amount of GH and PRL mRNA in the pituitary deceased dramatically with age. However, total poly(A+) RNA (mRNA), as measured by hybridization with radioactively labeled oligo-(dT), was not altered during aging. In addition, there were no age-related changes in the level of alpha-tubulin mRNA. Thus, the effects of aging on GH and PRL mRNA levels are specific; the levels of the majority of cellular mRNAs are not altered with age. GH and mRNA levels decreased 35% between 3 and 12 months (P less than 0.05) and a total of 75% after 27 months (P less than 0.01). PRL mRNA levels decreased 65% between 12 and 27 months (P less than 0.01), although there was no significant decrease before 12 months. Whereas T3 is the most potent regulator of GH gene expression, we did not detect any significant age-related change in serum T3 levels. These results suggest that factors other than T3 play a role in the age-related decline in GH and PRL gene expression.\r"

  ".U": "88004287\r", 
  ".W": "The present study was designed to characterize the dynamics of progestin metabolism peripherally and across the uterus during normal baboon pregnancy and to determine whether the decline in placental progesterone (P4) production which results from administration of the antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) to baboons reflects a decrease in conversion of pregnenolone (P5) to P4 and thus delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity. To examine this possibility, the conversion of [3H]P5 to [3H]P4 was determined by the constant infusion method on day 100 (midgestation) and day 175 (near term) of gestation in baboons that received MER-25 (25 mg/day X kg BW, po) on days 95-100 or 140-175 (term = 184 days). Baboons were sedated with ketamine HCl, then received a constant iv infusion of [3H]P5 (1.0 mu Ci/0.388 ml X min) and [14C]P4 (0.2 mu Ci/0.388 ml X min for 110 min. Radiolabeled progestins were purified from blood samples withdrawn from saphenous, uterine, and umbilical vessels, and the MCR of P4 and P5, uterine extraction of P5, and transfer constants (rho) for the peripheral, transuterofetoplacental, and transuteroplacental conversion of P5 to P4 were determined. The formation of P4 from P5 by incubates of placental cells obtained on day 175 from untreated and MER-25-treated baboons was also assessed. During normal baboon pregnancy the mean (+/- SE) % P5 extracted (i.e. metabolized) by the uterus was 31.0 +/- 3.3 at midgestation and 45.7 +/- 5.6 late in gestation. Peripheral and transuterofetoplacental rho values of P5 to P4 in untreated baboons were 6.9 +/- 1.8% and 37.3 +/- 7.9%, respectively, at midgestation and 6.1 +/- 0.6% and 46.8 +/- 10.1%, respectively, near term. The transuteroplacental rho of P5 to P4 was only slightly lower than the transuterofetoplacental values, indicating minimal conversion of P5 to P4 by the fetus. The peripheral contribution of P5 production to the total production rate of P4 at term in baboons was 1%. The contribution of uteroplacental conversion of P5 to P4 to the total conversion of P5 to P4 at midgestation was estimated to be 22%. MER-25 caused a 53% decline (P less than 0.01) in serum P4 concentrations from a mean (+/- SE) of 12.5 +/- 2.4 ng/ml during the pretreatment period to 5.4 +/- 0.3 ng/ml between days 140 and 175 of gestation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A sensitive in vitro assay based on the uptake of 125I by the FRTL-5 rat thyroid cell line has been applied to the measurement of TSH bioactivity from different sources. In this bioassay various human pituitary reference preparations showed similar potencies; the limit of detection and the half-maximal response were 1.60 +/- 0.1 (+/- SE) and 9.70 +/- 0.40 microU/0.5 ml, respectively; however, when compared to pituitary TSH from other species, human TSH was 29- and 10-fold less biopotent than bovine and rat TSH, respectively. The iodide uptake response to TSH was inhibited by the presence of human serum in a dose-dependent fashion, but pretreatment of serum with 10% polyethylene glycol restored TSH activity. The iodide uptake response was compared to the stimulation of cAMP production in the measurement of serum TSH bioactivity from human samples after immunoaffinity purification. In the cAMP production bioassay, immunoaffinity-purified serum TSH showed increased bioactivity in patients with primary hypothyroidism and TSH-secreting pituitary tumor compared to that in normal subjects, while in the iodide uptake bioassay minimal differences were detected among the different groups. To investigate further structure-function relationships of TSH in FRTL-5 cells we studied the effects of deglycosylated purified pituitary bovine and human TSH on both bioassays. Using two new enzymes, peptide-N-glycosidase and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F, we removed one carbohydrate chain from TSH alpha and all three chains from TSH, respectively. In the iodide uptake bioassay both enzymes induced a 2-fold decrease in TSH biopotency, while in the cAMP production bioassay this decrease was only present with peptide-N-glycosidase-treated TSH. In summary, 1) the iodide uptake bioassay system in FRTL-5 cells represents a valid and sensitive method for the measurement of TSH bioactivity from different sources and can be applied to serum samples with elevated TSH concentrations by simple pretreatment with polyethylene glycol without immunoaffinity purification; 2) the enzymatic removal of one carbohydrate chain from both bovine and human TSH significantly decrease their biological activity, assessed as cAMP production and iodide uptake response in FRTL-5 cells, while the removal of three carbohydrate chains induces a significant decrease only in the iodide uptake bioassay: and 3) the disparate results for cAMP and iodide uptake in both human samples and deglycosylated pituitary TSH suggest that in addition to cAMP, other second messengers may play a role in TSH action.\r"

  ".W": "A two-component estrogen (E2)-binding system has been characterized in the E2-independent MTW-9B rat mammary tumor by Scatchard analysis, sucrose gradient analysis, and isoelectric focusing. One cytosol receptor protein (type I) conforms to the classical estrogen receptor with a high affinity (Kd = 0.45 nM) for E2 and limited binding capacity [maximum binding (Bmax) = 53 fmol/mg protein]. The second component (type II) demonstrates a high number of sites (Bmax = 164 fmol/mg protein) and low E2-binding affinity (Kd = 22.3 nM). The type I and type II E2-binding components were shown to sediment on sucrose gradients at 9.6S and 4.5S, respectively, and to focus at isoelectric points of 6.6 and 8.0, respectively. The addition of 0.4 M KCl to the homogenization buffer converted the high affinity receptor species to a form that cosedimented and cofocused with the low affinity E2-binding protein. When tumors were grown in intact male rats, the ratio of the type II to the type I protein, as assessed by sucrose gradient analysis, increased 4.5-fold relative to that in tumors from intact females. Concomitantly, the Kd values of the type I and type II proteins were increased 9- and 2-fold, respectively, and the Bmax of the type I protein was decreased. No changes in the ratios of the E2-binding proteins were observed in tumors grown in ovariectomized female or castrated male rats; however, the Kd for both proteins was increased in tumors from the latter group. Relative to that in intact females, tumor growth was retarded in intact male rats, but was unaffected by ovariectomy or castration. These studies demonstrate that the presence of the low affinity E2-binding protein does not necessarily predict E2 responsiveness. While the role of the type II cytosolic protein has not yet been established, it is possible that it could act as a reservoir for E2, which is required to activate specific biochemical functions such as progesterone receptor synthesis. Alternatively, it could be a nonactivated, perhaps norphosphorylated, form of the E2 receptor which binds E2 with only a very low affinity.\r"

These butyrate-induced enkephalin-immunoreactive peptides, which are specific products of the proenkephalin gene, consist principally of two high mol wt forms of amino-terminally extended Met5-enk-RGL. These high mol wt peptides, with apparent mol wt of 20,000 and 10,000, are approximately the same size as the two major immunoreactive peptides found in adult New England Deaconess Hospital rat adrenal. The low mol wt Met5-enk-RGL-immunoreactive peptide found in butyrate-treated cells is similar in size to authentic Met5-enk-RGL, which is not found in the adrenal medulla of the adult rat. When PC12 cells are grown as a tumor in vivo, the amount of Met5-enk-RGL-immunoreactive peptide increased only slightly above the level found in control cells grown in vitro and consisted exclusively of the highest mol wt immunoreactive species. In PC12 cells, the butyrate-stimulated elevation in the content of Met5-enk-RGL-immunoreactive peptides may involve changes in transcription, since the peptide increase is preceded by a 2- to 3-fold increase in the level of proenkephalin mRNA. These results suggest that the PC12 cell line may be useful for investigating those factors that control the initial expression and processing of proenkephalin-derived peptides during embryogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin II is a potent octapeptide vasoconstrictor and regulator of cardiovascular and electrolyte homeostasis. Angiotensinogen, the protein precursor of angiotensin II, is synthesized by the liver and many other organs of the adult rat. To determine whether angiotensin may be present in early fetal development we analyzed rat embryonic tissues (chorionic membranes, head, and body) for the expression of the angiotensinogen gene during days 11-21 of embryogenesis. Angiotensinogen mRNA was detected at low levels in embryo bodies and yolk sac placenta from day 11 of gestation. An initial rise in the level was noted on day 13, reaching a plateau from day 17 of gestation to birth. Angiotensinogen mRNA levels of the embryonic head were about 10-fold less than those of the body on days 17-19 and increased to levels similar to those of the body on days 20-21. Angiotensinogen mRNA levels of the yolk sac placenta were about 20-fold higher than those in the embryonic body, but no angiotensinogen mRNA was detected in the chorioallantoic placenta. Angiotensinogen mRNA from both embryos and yolk sac placenta was larger by about 200 bases than the mRNA obtained from adult rat liver; this was shown to be a consequence of both the utilization of more distal polyadenylation sites and a longer poly(A) tract. These observations suggest the possibility of a biological function for angiotensinogen in the early development of the rat, and that polyadenylation site selection may alter the functional expression of the angiotensinogen gene in a developmentally specific manner.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose transport in rat uterus was investigated in order to determine whether the stimulation of transport by estradiol was the result of an increase in the amount of glucose transport protein in plasma membranes. In cycling rats, transport was highest during proestrus, the day on which serum estradiol concentrations are highest. In ovariectomized rats, the stimulation of transport was estrogen specific and was nearly complete within 2-3 h after injection of 0.1 microgram estradiol per animal. Estradiol stimulation resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in Vmax of 2-deoxy-D-glucose transport with no significant change in Michaelis-Menten constant (Km). Inhibition of the stimulation by cycloheximide or actinomycin D could not be demonstrated, although cycloheximide treatment did cause an increase in the basal rate of transport up to that observed with estradiol treatment. Upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting, a single protein in uterine plasma membranes reacted with a rabbit antiserum made against purified human erythrocyte glucose transport protein. This protein, believed to be the glucose transport protein, had a mol wt of 49,000 and appeared as a broad band as expected for a glycoprotein. It was found by a protein A-linked immunoassay that the amount of transport protein in uterine plasma membranes was 3.2 +/- 0.4% of the amount in human erythrocyte ghosts. Estradiol treatment had no effect on this value. These data suggest that the stimulation of glucose transport by estradiol occurred by an increase in the intrinsic activity of the transport protein rather than by an increase in the amount of transport protein in plasma membranes.\r"

In rats with 5-day ovarian cycles, the vaginal cyclicity disappeared. Uninterrupted vaginal cornification emerged within 4 days after the start of treatment and cornification persisted for the whole period of treatment. It took more than 2 weeks after cessation of 2-4 weeks of treatment before 5-day vaginal cycles reappeared. Ovarian weights increased rapidly resulting from the accumulation of large numbers of corpora lutea. In addition, the ovaries developed occasional follicular cysts which could reach an extremely large size (2 mm or more). Analysis of serial histological sections of ovaries, combined with plasma concentrations of estradiol-17 beta and progesterone, indicated cyclic ovulation and corpus luteum formation together with persistence of functional activity of already existing and newly formed corpora lutea. RU486 seems to have the unique property of dissociating cessation of luteal activity and ovulation in rats. After treatment with RU486, pituitary enlargement and mammary gland alveolar development were observed. It is hypothesized that these effects result from unopposed estrogen action on PRL secretion. The effects of RU486 are reversible: 4 to 5 weeks after the end of treatment ovarian activity seems normal (as evidenced by reduction of ovarian weights and 5-day vaginal cycles) except for the presence of occasional large follicular cysts which may require longer periods for their regression.\r"

A dose-dependent reduction of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) was observed which reached its maximal extent (41%) at a concentration of 300 microM CySH after 1-5 min. There was no release of somatostatin into the incubation medium. CySH at concentrations of up to 10 mM did not interfere in the RIA. Among a variety of compounds, structurally related to CySH 4-aminothiophenol, 2-aminothiophenol and N,N-dimethylaminothiol exhibited the highest efficacy in decreasing somatostatin (60%, 50%, 30%, respectively, at 10 mM and 10 min). The disulfide form of CySH cystamine and dimercaprol resulted in about 15% reduction after 10-min incubation, whereas taurine, alanine, cysteine, and mercaptoethanol were inactive. A saturable, sodium-dependent uptake process was found for the disulfide form of [35S]CySH cystamine [Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) = 18.6 microM, maximum velocity (Vmax) = 2.3 nmol/mg protein X 3 min) which was inhibited by cysteine (87% at 1 mM). [35S]CySH, at concentrations of 20 microM or less, was not stable in buffer solution. It underwent considerable nonenzymatic conversion into its dimeric form (60% at 37 C and 3 min), however it exhibited the same kinetic data for its uptake. Size exclusion HPLC of purified hypothalamic synaptosomes revealed a major SLI peak coeluting with synthetic somatostatin-14 and two minor peaks representing somatostatin-28 and a 13,000 mol wt protein. The three molecular forms of somatostatin were reduced to varied extent by CySH (somatostatin-14 by about 70%, somatostatin-28 by 15%, and the high mol wt form by 30%). Our experiments suggest that high affinity uptake of CySH may precede its action in decreasing somatostatin levels. Increased release or inhibition of synthesis of somatostatin have been excluded as possible mechanisms. It is suggested that SLI is equally affected in nerve endings and in perikarya.\r"

This decrease was completely prevented when the oxygen tension was reduced to 1% O2 or when steroid synthesis was inhibited by aminoglutethimide. When the endogenous concentration of pregnenolone was increased by inhibiting its further metabolism, P-450scc activity was reduced by 80% in unstimulated cultures and was completely eliminated in cAMP-treated cultures. These losses were prevented when cells were maintained at 1% O2. The amount of immunoreactive P-450scc was also decreased by treatments that reduced P-450scc activity. Stimulation with cAMP also lowered microsomal C17-20 lyase activity by an oxygen-mediated, steroid synthesis-dependent mechanism. Treatment of cultures with testosterone caused a similar oxygen tension-sensitive decrease in C17-20 lyase activity. These results suggest that the enhanced loss of mitochondrial and microsomal cytochrome P-450 activities in cAMP-treated cultures is caused by the increased production of pregnenolone and testosterone, respectively, which generate reactive damaging species derived from reduced dioxygen. The increased catalytic turnover of these P-450 enzymes may also contribute to their damage. Although P-450 activities were preserved at 1% O2, the ability of cAMP-treated cells to synthesize testosterone in response to subsequent cAMP stimulation was still reduced. If, however, 25-hydroxycholesterol was supplied to these cells the decrease in testosterone-producing capacity was prevented, which demonstrates that the reduced steroidogenic capacity of cAMP-treated Leydig cells is caused, primarily, by the reduced availability of endogenous cholesterol.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro cytosolic receptor binding assays and autoradiographical procedures have shown the localization and properties of two corticoid receptor types in the brain of the rat, a species in which corticosterone (B) is the predominant circulating glucocorticoid. The present study was designed to examine the localization, heterogeneity, and binding specificity of corticosteroid receptors in the brain of the hamster, a species which secretes B and cortisol (F), the latter being the predominantly circulating form. Our results show that two corticoid receptor systems can also be distinguished in the hamster brain. The type I receptor has an almost exclusive localization in the hippocampal region and the amounts measured in hypothalamic or whole brain (without the hippocampus) were negligible. The type II receptor, on the other hand, has a wider distribution in the brain. Scatchard and Woolf analyses of the binding data revealed that the hamster type I receptor has similar affinity to both F and B [dissociation constant (Kd) 0.9 nM]. In contrast the rat type I binds with higher affinity to B (Kd, 0.9 nM) than to F (Kd, 2.2 nM). The hamster type II binds to F with much higher affinity (Kd, 2.9 nM) than does the rat type II to F (Kd, 20.1 nM). This was similarly observed, although less pronounced in the binding of the hamster type II and the rat type II to B (Kd, 0.5 and 3.9 nM, respectively). Analysis of relative binding affinity of each receptor type gave the following results. Hamster type I: F greater than B much greater than aldosterone (ALDO) greater than dexamethasone (DEX); rat type I: B greater than F greater than ALDO greater than DEX; hamster type II: B greater than DEX greater than F much greater than ALDO; rat type II: DEX greater than B much greater than F much greater than ALDO. Graded doses of F or B given sc to adrenalectomized animals result in differential occupancy of the two receptor systems. In hamster, 1.0 microgram F vs. 1.0 mg B/100 g BW is required to occupy 80% of type I site. The rat shows the opposite (1.0 microgram B vs. 5.0 to 10.0 mg F/100 g BW to occupy type I to the same extent). The hamster type II is 80-90% occupied by an equal dose of F or B (1.0 mg/100 g BW) whereas in the rat, F at 5-10 mg/100 g BW (doses 5-10 times that of B) is required to achieve this same occupancy.

Neonatal ovariectomy or sham operation was performed at 1-2 days of age; thereafter, the animals were immediately given testosterone propionate (250 micrograms) or vehicle. Other rats, also treated neonatally with testosterone, were ovariectomized 15-22 days before blood sampling. Plasma GH was measured in blood samples obtained from indwelling intraatrial cannulae every 20 min for 8 h when the animals were 100-140 days old. Plasma GH secretory patterns were analyzed by a pulse analysis computer program (PULSAR). Neonatal testosterone treatment did not affect the GH secretory pattern of female rats with intact ovaries. In contrast, neonatal androgen treatment enhanced GH pulse height as well as mean GH concentration in neonatally ovariectomized female rats to levels comparable to those in intact male rats. Neonatal testosterone administration also significantly increased GH pulse height and mean plasma GH concentration in female rats that were ovariectomized during adulthood. However, the GH secretory pattern of ovariectomized female rats given testosterone neonatally still differed markedly from that of normal males, in that GH pulses occurred less regularly and baseline levels were higher. Pituitary GH content and concentration in neonatally ovariectomized female rats were increased to levels indistinguishable from those in male rats by neonatal testosterone treatment. No significant effect of neonatal testosterone was observed in sham-operated females. Neonatal ovariectomy decreased basal plasma GH levels, but did not affect plasma GH pulse height or pituitary GH levels. The serum estradiol concentration was markedly decreased in ovariectomized female rats, but was unchanged in sham-operated rats given neonatal testosterone, raising the possibility that serum estradiol secretion mediated the antagonistic effect of the ovaries on neonatal androgen imprinting. These results indicate that the presence of ovaries can prevent the stimulatory effect of neonatal androgen exposure on GH storage and secretion in adult female rats.\r"

In this study, we extend those observations and have measured in L cells the effects of hormone treatment on mRNA encoding NGF. L Cells were grown for 3 days in the presence or absence of hormones. NGF in conditioned medium was measured by NGF RIA; NGF mRNA was measured in cell extracts by Northern blot analysis. Cortisone reduced NGF levels in conditioned medium below the limit of detection of the RIA (less than 10% of control values) with an ED50 of 5 X 10(-9) M; NGF mRNA was reduced to 12% of control levels with an ED50 of 1 X 10(-8) M. Reductions in mRNA were maximal within 3 h and were completely reversed 12 h after removal of the hormone. Levels of NGF in conditioned medium were also undetectable in cultures treated with testosterone, and mRNA levels were reduced by 80%; the ED50 for both effects was 4 X 10(-9) M. Aldosterone (1 X 10(-6) M) reduced NGF to below detectable levels and NGF mRNA by 70%. Progesterone and thyroid hormone had no effect on NGF or NGF mRNA. 17 beta-Estradiol reduced levels of NGF in medium by 50%, but had no detectable effect on levels of NGF mRNA. These results suggest that cortisone, testosterone, and aldosterone decrease NGF levels in L cell-conditioned medium by reducing the cellular content of NGF mRNA.\r"

Although the glucagon dose-response curve of normal MDCK cells resembled that of liver and kidney (Kact = 10 nM), the transformed-induced cells were 10-fold less sensitive to the hormone [activation constant (Kact) = 100 nM]. Additionally, the stimulation of cAMP synthesis by a glucagon fragment (glucagon) in transformed-induced cells was greatly reduced compared to normal cells. The adenylate cyclase regulatory components of transformed-induced MDCK cell membranes seemed unaltered compared to the parental line. Both contained equivalent amounts of cholera and pertussis toxin substrates, and soluble extracts were equally capable of reconstituting isoproterenol responsiveness of S49 cyc- membranes. However, membrane fusion studies demonstrated that the glucagon sensitivity of transformed-induced membranes could not be reconstituted with heterologous membranes. When donor transformed-induced membranes (with inactivated adenylate cyclase) were fused with acceptor HeLa membranes (normally unresponsive to glucagon and prostaglandin E), such hybrids were unresponsive to glucagon, although responsiveness to prostaglandin E was evident. Parallel hybrids with normal MDCK membranes were responsive to both glucagon and prostaglandin E. This difference could not be explained by an inhibitory effect of transformed-induced membranes on receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling under the fusion conditions: the ability of these membranes to serve as an acceptor for the reconstitution of vasoactive intestinal peptide responsiveness was identical to that of normal MDCK cells. The data suggest that the glucagon sensitivity induced in transformed MDCK cells differs significantly from that of the parental line. However, these differences cannot be explained by alterations of transformed-induced membrane components relevant to the coupling of hormone receptors to adenylate cyclase.\r"

  ".W": "Since specific binding to receptors and biological effects of insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are demonstrable soon after the neural tube closes and organogenesis begins in the chick embryo, in the present study we have analyzed the structural characteristics and specificity of the receptors for insulin and IGFs at this early stage of development. We show that membranes from newly differentiated chick embryo tissues (day 6 brain, day 6 heart, day 8 liver, day 12 skeletal muscle) as well as whole embryos postneurulation (day 2, stage of 27-30 somites) have two populations of receptors with distinct specificity: insulin and type I IGF (IGF-I) receptors. Both insulin and IGF-I alpha-subunits, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, had tissue-dependent heterogeneity in Mr (liver greater than heart = skeletal muscle greater than brain) ranging from 138 kilodaltons (kDa) to 129 kDa. Desialylation of the receptors by treatment with neuraminidase produced a significant change in the Mr of the alpha-subunits in liver and heart but not in brain or the whole day 2 embryo. In each tissue the pattern for insulin receptors and IGF-I receptors was strikingly similar. Our studies raise the possibility that postranslational modifications of the insulin and IGF-I receptors, characteristic of terminally differentiated tissues, are already present in early organogenesis. Further, structural heterogeneity of the binding subunit of these receptors among tissues appears to be widespread and not exclusive to the brain receptor. An insulin receptor with features similar to the neural type is the only one detected in embryos at the beginning of organogenesis (day 2). The functional implication of this developmental tissue-specific regulation of insulin and IGF-I receptors, is still speculative. Its possible importance is suggested by the fact that it occurs embryologically early and affects both insulin and IGF-I receptors in parallel.\r"

  ".W": "Stimulation of mitogenesis in rat Nb2 node lymphoma cells by human (h) PRL was inhibited by inhibitors of Na+/H+ exchange (viz. amiloride and its analogs) and inhibitors of protein kinases (isoquinolinesulfonamide derivatives). The most potent were ethylisopropylamiloride (EP-Am) (IC50, 13 microM) and H-7, selective for protein kinase C (IC50, 23 microM), suggesting the possible involvement of Na+/H+ exchange and protein kinase C in mediating Nb2 cell mitogenesis. In the presence of hPRL, the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), known to activate the Na+/H+ antiporter as well as protein kinase C in other cell systems, enhanced the hPRL-stimulated Nb2 cell mitogenesis. TPA alone caused a dose- and time-dependent stimulation of H+ efflux in stationary cultures of Nb2 cells but had no effect on cell growth. From 25-100 nM TPA, the increase in the rate of H+ efflux was detectable by 3 min, reached a maximum by 15 min, and was sustained 30 min after the addition of TPA. The TPA-stimulated H+ efflux was dependent on extracellular Na+ and was almost completely inhibited after a 10 min preincubation with 25 microM EP-Am. TPA also increased the intracellular pH (pHi) of stationary cultures of Nb2 cells from 7.29 +/- 0.02 (n = 8) to a maximum of 7.45 +/- 0.03 (n = 10). The most rapid and greatest response was observed with 40 nM TPA which gave a detectable increase in pHi within 1 min and reached a maximum alkalinization by 6 min. Higher concentrations of TPA had no additional effect. The nontumor promoter phorbol 12,13,20-triacetate (PTA), either alone or in the presence of hPRL, had no effect on Nb2 cell proliferation or on H+ efflux or pHi in Hb2 cells. The TPA-induced increase in pHi was Na+-dependent and was inhibited by EP-Am and H-7. A preincubation with EP-Am (25 microM) for 5-10 min abolished the TPA-induced increase in pHi whereas prolonged incubation with H-7 (50 microM) for up to 3 h was required to decrease the stimulatory effect of TPA by approximately 50%. Although activation of the Na+/H+ exchange system is clearly an early consequence of the action of TPA on Nb2 cells, the failure of TPA to stimulate Nb2 cell proliferation suggests that stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange and protein kinase C activity are not sufficient to generate a mitogenic response in these cells.\r"

The hPRL-induced increase in H+ efflux rate was dependent on dose, time, and the concentration of extracellular Na+. From 5-100 ng/ml, the hPRL-induced increase in H+ efflux rate was measurable by 3 min and reached a dose-dependent maximum by 15 min. A higher final H+ efflux rate was achieved with a higher concentration of hPRL. Complete replacement of Na+ by choline chloride gave a marginal increase in the rate of H+ efflux upon addition of hPRL. At a maximum noncytotoxic concentration (25 microM), the potent amiloride analog, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EP-Am), decreased but did not abolish, the stimulatory effect of hPRL. The hPRL-stimulated increase in H+ efflux rate was accompanied by an EP-Am-sensitive uptake of 22Na+ in acid-loaded (pHi = 6.2) Nb2 cells as well as EP-Am sensitive and extracellular Na+-dependent increase in pHi. One minute after the addition of hPRL (5 ng/ml), there was a significant increase in (P less than 0.01) 22Na+ uptake over the hormonally untreated controls. Addition of hPRL (5 and 10 ng/ml) to Nb2 cells induced a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in pHi within 4 min, while with a higher concentration of 30 ng/ml the increase was significant by 1 min. In all cases, the pHi was raised from a resting value of 7.29 +/- 0.02 (n = 8) to a maximum of 7.45 +/- 0.02 (n = 8). The hPRL-stimulated increase in pHi was abolished in Nb2 cells preincubated for 5-10 min with EP-Am (25 microM) before the addition of the hormone. Activation of Na+/H+ exchange in Nb2 cells was also achieved with human recombinant interleukin 2 and guinea pig antiserum to PRL receptors. In each case, there was a dose- and time-dependent increase in H+ efflux rate which was detectable by 3 min. However, both antiserum to PRL receptor (n = 4) and interleukin 2 (n = 6) raised pHi to a maximum of only 7.35 +/- 0.01. The Na+/H+ exchange system in Nb2 cells was also activated by osmotic shocking, rapidly raising pHi to 7.45 +/- 0.01 (n = 3). Activation was abolished by EP-Am. Contrary to these observations, rat GH which is not mitogenic did not have an effect on pHi in Nb2 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88004321\r", 
  ".W": "Rat adipocytes in primary culture have been used to study the intracellular processing of GH. These classic target cells for GH have been shown to process GH through two pathways: a nondegradative pathway which resulted in the rapid release of intact GH, and a slower, degradative pathway which involved the degradation of GH and release of degraded ligand. Differentiation between the two pathways was on the basis of differences in their kinetics and temperature dependence. The present study has investigated the relative characteristics of the two pathways further. Incubation of [125I]human GH ([125I]hGH)-preloaded adipocytes with extracellular unlabeled hGH (400 ng/ml) resulted in an increase in the absolute amount of [125I]hGH released. The increased amount of [125I]hGH released was all intact. Extracellular, unlabeled hGH had no effect on the rate or amount of degraded [125I]hGH released. This suggests that the nondegradative pathway is sensitive to the number of internalized hormone-receptor complexes and that GH which is not immediately degraded or stored in the degradative pathway, is redirected and processed via the faster non-degradative pathway. Ammonium chloride (known to inhibit the lysosomal degradation of many polypeptide hormones) markedly inhibited the absolute amount of [125I]hGH released from preloaded adipocytes. This inhibition was due to an effect on the release of degraded [125I]hGH. NH4Cl had no effect on the rate or amount of intact [125I]hGH released. Finally, it was found that dinitrophenol and sodium fluoride (agents known to deplete cellular energy) inhibited the release of degraded GH but not intact GH suggesting that the degradative pathway involves an energy-dependent step, most likely the fusion of hormone-containing vesicles with the lysosomal membrane. The mechanism of release of intact hormone by energy-independent means is not yet known. These data indicate that the processing of GH by cultured rat adipocytes is complex and involves at least two independently regulated pathways, a predominant degradative route and a nondegradative route. Further studies are required to assess the possible roles of these pathways in the metabolic actions of GH in adipocytes.\r"

To examine this issue rats were administered ACTH or corticosterone or subjected to adrenalectomy, and the quantity of peripherally directed transported SP was measured in those animals as an indication of neuropeptide synthesis. ACTH treatment (12 U/day, sc, for 14 days) resulted in significant adrenal hypertrophy and increased corticosterone levels. The 24-h accumulation of SP proximal to ligature in the cervical vagus was significantly reduced [mean net proximal segment content: controls, 529 +/- 42 (+/- SEM) pg/3 mm segment; ACTH, 282 +/- 44]. The content in the unligated nerve, one sixth or less than that proximal to ligature, was not different in the two groups. In a separate experiment, ACTH (6 U/day for 14 days) had no effect compared to controls, whereas 16 U/day reduced transported SP. The content in the unligated nerve was again not different in the two groups. In the same experiment, corticosterone (2.5 mg/100 g BW, sc, for 14 days) reduced the quantity of transported SP. Total protein content in proximal segments was reduced only in the corticosterone group and was identical in all groups in unligated nerve. Adrenalectomy modestly increased transport by 20% and contralateral unligated nerve content by a similar percentage. The quantity of transported somatostatin, another vagal neuropeptide partly derived from sensory cell bodies, was either increased or unaltered by the experimental manipulations. In summary, these studies demonstrate that the chronic administration of ACTH or corticosterone significantly decreases the quantity of peripherally transported SP in the sensory vagus nerve and, presumably, synthesis within the vagal sensory ganglia. Down-regulation of synthesized/transported neuropeptide suggests a mechanism by which the ACTH-adrenal axis, acting through visceral sensory nerves, may modulate autonomic or central nervous system vagally mediated reflex arcs.\r"

  ".W": "In order to identify likely sites of action in insulin in rat brain we have used the technique of in vitro autoradiography and computerized densitometry to map, characterize, and quantify its receptors in coronal and sagittal sections. A discrete and characteristic distribution of insulin receptor binding was demonstrated, with specific binding representing 92% of total binding. Displacement and specificity competition curves in olfactory bulb are typical for authentic insulin receptors, and computer analysis indicates a single class of binding site with a dissociation constant (Kd) 0.48 nM for choroid plexus and 0.44 nM for olfactory bulb external plexiform layer. Insulin receptor density is maximum in the choroid plexus, and high in the external plexiform layer of olfactory bulb. Structures of the limbic system and hypothalamus reveal moderate to high insulin receptor density, particularly the lateral septum, amygdala, subiculum, hippocampal CA1 region, mammillary body, and arcuate nucleus. Moderate insulin receptor density occurs in regions of cerebral cortex and cerebellum, and moderate to low binding occurs in discrete brainstem and midbrain structures. Insulin binding in the pituitary gland is greatest in the anterior lobe, with clear distinction from intermediate and posterior lobes. The circumventricular organs and the thalamus show low insulin binding. We conclude that insulin receptors are widespread throughout rat brain, with concentration in regions concerned with olfaction, appetite, and autonomic functions. The distribution is distinct from other neuropeptides and not related to either vascularity or cell density. A common feature of regions rich in insulin receptors is that they contain dendritic fields receiving rich synaptic input. Whether insulin plays a specific neurotransmitter or metabolic role in these sites remains unclear, but these studies have provided detailed information on potential sites of action of insulin in the brain, and will allow further studies to examine insulin receptor function in specific brain regions.\r"

The remaining 10 patients had an exponential distribution of seizure intervals, but did not fit other criteria for a Poisson process; 3 of these showed evidence for seizure clustering; none showed evidence for a seizure cycle. It is concluded that the pattern of seizure occurrence in most epileptic people is random, but in approximately 50%, it is not occurring according to a Poisson process. These observations indicate that seizure cycling and/or clustering are not common in epileptic patients, but do not exclude the possibility that seizures have been precipitated by some randomly occurring event, such as sleep deprivation or increased stress.\r"

Of a total of 55 seizures, four had simultaneous onset in neocortex and hippocampus, and 51 had onset in unilateral hippocampus. None originated solely in temporal neocortex. Three reproducible patterns of seizure spread from hippocampus were defined in which seizures spread initially to ipsilateral neocortex (32 seizures), spread first to contralateral hippocampus (13 seizures), or spread simultaneously to ipsilateral neocortex and contralateral hippocampus. Although the region of hippocampus in which seizures arose was constant, patterns of spread sometimes varied in the same patient. When contralateral neocortical involvement occurred, it was after or with contralateral hippocampus but never before. These results suggest the existence of an operational hippocampal commissure in humans.\r"

In 87% of cases, methohexital caused selective activation of the epileptogenic focus during acute electrocorticography (ECoG). This activation appeared to be specific for the epileptogenic focus and did not cause epileptiform spiking from adjacent nonepileptogenic cortex. This ECoG activation occurred whether patients received local or general anesthesia. Sixty-five percent of patients demonstrated adequate activation with as little as 25 mg of drug. Methohexital is a safe and reliable method of activating epileptogenic foci during acute ECoG recordings and can decrease the time for ECoG recordings during surgery.\r"

  ".U": "88004365\r", 
  ".W": "The treatment of epilepsy with carbamazepine (CBZ) may be hampered by cognitive side effects. These side effects are thought to be related to pharmacokinetic properties of the drug. The serum concentration of CBZ is characterized by rapid absorption and a short half-life, which may lead to a considerable fluctuation of the level between doses. Cognitive defects may result from peak levels: short periods with high serum concentration. In a single-blind crossover design, cognitive performance was compared in three conditions. All patients were first tested in the steady state of conventional CBZ. The patients were then assigned randomly to either CBZ-controlled release (CR) or a condition in which conventional CBZ was administered in the same tablet form and dose frequency as CR. Psychological tests were administered four times daily, immediately after the serum samples were taken. A nonmedication control group was tested following the same test scheme to obtain standards for the evaluation of changes in performance during the day. A systematic tendency was found toward higher test performance in the CR condition. This is especially evident for tests of memory and accuracy of visual information processing. The results of the repeated test procedure show that the smoothing effect of the CR condition on serum concentration fluctuations results in a more stable pattern of cognitive functioning during the day.\r"

Polygraphic studies failed to show any electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during myoclonic jerks. Appearance of nonepileptic myoclonus in epileptic children treated with CBZ should be carefully evaluated to prevent worsening of the clinical picture. The coexistence of other involuntary movements (tics) could suggest the correct diagnosis.\r"

Maximal radiological changes occurred in the area of maximal epileptic discharge; however, multiple lesions were seen in three cases. The CT lesion reappeared with recurrence of the ictus in four cases during follow-up, and this, too, disappeared after complete arrest of the seizures. The clinical, CT scan, and other investigatory findings suggest that the seizures may occasionally cause a CT-demonstrable focal abnormality, probably cerebral edema, a consequence of abnormal vascular permeability. Awareness of this radiological entity should avoid misdiagnosis of cerebral tumor, infarction or tuberculoma in patients with seizure disorder.\r"

EEG seizures originated independently from each temporal-occipital area, predominantly from the right. Previous EEGs had shown almost exclusively right temporo-occipital epileptogenic activity. MRI showed increased signal intensity, and CT showed decreased right hemisphere attenuation without enhancement. One month later, there was resolution of the radiological and clinical abnormalities. The transient CT and MRI changes probably represented focal cerebral edema, developing during focal status epilepticus. Lack of change in the left hemisphere probably reflected the quantitative difference in epileptic activity. Clues to the diagnosis of focal edema due to status include: (1) changes on electrical and imaging studies that correlate anatomically with the clinical status, and (2) resolution of abnormalities with appropriate seizure control. In patients with suspected seizure disorders, electrical and clinical data should be correlated before interpretation is made of focal lesions seen by neuroimaging techniques.\r"

In this subgroup particularly, poor outcome, i.e., death or functional decline, was common (10 of 13 patients). Thirty-six patients had seizures just prior to or during the hospitalization when PLEDs were observed; focal motor seizures were the most common type (n = 22). Patients with a history of seizures prior to the occurrence of PLEDs continued to have seizures following discharge. In addition, 4 of 9 patients with new onset seizures associated with PLEDs had subsequent seizures.\r"

One commonly used paradigm, the free recall of a list(s) of related or unrelated words, has revealed a variety of performance anomalies in patients with complex partial seizures (CPS) of temporal lobe origin, but published studies have varied markedly in important methodological details, making it difficult to interpret discrepant findings as well as to assess the generalizability of results. The purpose of this investigation was to simultaneously inquire into several aspects of verbal learning and memory function that have been reported or hypothesized to be compromised in individuals with CPS of left temporal lobe origin. Thirty patients with CPS of lateralized temporal lobe onset [15 left temporal (LT) and 15 right temporal (RT)] were compared with 15 matched controls (NC) on several measures derived from the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), i.e., verbal learning ability, immediate free recall, presence of retroactive interference effects, semantic organization, retrieval efficiency, and recognition memory. Compared to RT and NC groups, the LT patients manifested poorer verbal learning ability, impaired immediate memory, and increased difficulty in the retrieval of verbal material from memory store. Compared to NC subjects, the LT group showed poorer semantic organization in their verbal learning and recall. The RT and NC groups were essentially similar in all respects. Finally, the clinical utility of these findings were investigated, and a series of decision rules designed to separate LT from RT patients was derived.\r"

However, performance errors (erroneous deviations from the intended product), were found to be made more frequently by epileptic children. Epileptic children made more corrections and also left more errors uncorrected than control children. No relationship could be established with illness variables.

A subgroup of alcoholic patients exhibited a smaller GH response to seizures. Stressed patients had significantly less elevated cortisol and PRL plasma values, but no rise of GH. The data suggest that neurogenic stimuli responsible for the postictal release of GH, cortisol, and PRL are, at least in part, independent of stress mechanisms and that GH response is blunted in alcoholic patients.\r"

The negative relationship between serum estrogen and Ca++ was confirmed. However, a study of 15 institutionalized epileptic women, all with a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy, demonstrated that fewer seizures occurred in midcycle (when estrogen levels were elevated and Ca++ levels were decreased) than at other stages of the menstrual cycle. This is suggestive of a protective (anticonvulsant) aspect of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal negative feedback system, previously unreported.\r"

An asynchronism of several hours between the stage of development of the largest and large cohort follicles is observed; overripeness of oocyte cumulus complex (OCC) is revealed. An asynchronous response to gonadotropins in granulosa and cumulus is also seen in the cohort of medium follicles of the same ovary, but not resumption of nuclear maturation of the oocyte. The efficiency of these oocytes after fertilization is discussed.\r"

Initially, 100,000 motile spermatozoa were transferred per fallopian tube and no pregnancies were achieved in 11 cases. The technique was then modified so that a maximal number of motile spermatozoa were transferred (range, 0.11 to 0.90 X 10(6) spermatozoa) and 6 of 21 (29%) pregnancies resulted, with 325,000 spermatozoa being the lowest number associated with pregnancy. It appears that the modified GIFT technique, whereby an increased number of motile spermatozoa are replaced with the oocytes, is an effective therapy in the treatment of oligospermic infertility.\r"

In group 1 cycles, insemination of mature/questionably mature oocytes (judged by cumulus and corona cell appearance) at 6.5 hours postcollection yielded a fertilization rate of 42.3%. This value was significantly lower than that obtained with reinsemination (70.8%). In group 2, questionably mature oocytes were treated as immature and inseminated 24 to 30 hours postcollection. The fertilization rate of mature eggs in group 2 was 68.2%, with a reinsemination success rate of 40%. Triploidy rates and cleavage rates of mature eggs, fertilized either at initial insemination or reinsemination and of fertilized immature eggs, were similar within group 1 and group 2 cycles. In group 1, two pregnancies resulted from transfer of embryos arising solely from successful reinsemination, with one infant delivered. These results indicate that reinsemination offers a useful adjunct for IVF in cases where fertilization failure occurs.\r"

In these cycles, the proportion of diploid oocytes (n = 275) that cleaved (cleavage rate) (92.7%) was significantly greater than the proportion of polyploid oocytes (n = 90) that cleaved (65.5%) (P less than 0.001). The cleavage rate for all diploid oocytes (n = 1834) was 90.4%. There was no significant difference in the stage of development (number of blastomeres; mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) on the day of embryo transfer between diploid (4.3 +/- 2.1) and polyploid (4.1 +/- 2.1) embryos that cleaved, but a plot of the frequency distribution of cleavage stages revealed that significantly more polyploid than diploid embryos had an uneven number of blastomeres at that time (33% versus 8%, respectively; P less than 0.001). Polyploidy confers an immediate developmental disadvantage; one third of polyploid embryos fail to cleave, and those that do divide demonstrate more asynchronous divisions.\r"

This study evaluated two semen profiles for each of 500 couples on IVF treatment. The first semen sample was collected in the couple's pre-IVF workup, and the second sample was given by husbands after ovum aspiration, and used to inseminate the eggs in vitro. Comparisons of samples revealed that sperm density, total sperm count, and both quantitative and qualitative sperm motility were significantly lower in the second sample presented for IVF. For 91% of cases, there was no change across samples in assigned fertility index categories. However, 14 cases revealed a deterioration, falling from normal to pathologic, while 21 cases changed in semen character from normal in IVF workup to severely pathologic in IVF treatment. For these cases, the incidence of total fertilization failure in the procedure also dramatically increased. Several steps are discussed in the better management of patients with such declines in semen quality.\r"

Single spermatozoa treated in this way were injected under the zona pellucida of morphologically mature oocytes and fertilization was confirmed by electron-microscopy. Five of seven oocytes manipulated within 9 hours of aspiration from the follicle and 3 of 12 oocytes manipulated 23 to 28 hours after recovery from the follicle fertilized.

There was a dysplastic development of the fibrous sheath, which appeared hyperplastic and disorganized. The axoneme was either missing or grossly distorted. In a few instances, a normal flagellum could be identified. Similar alterations also were detected in maturing spermatids, suggesting that the described defect develops during spermiogenesis. Two of the five patients had recurrent bronchial and sinusal infections and bronchiectasis, suggesting the possible existence of an associated abnormality in respiratory cilia. The existence of a common ultrastructural defect affecting most spermatozoa, its presence in two brothers, and the possibility of association with immotile respiratory cilia point to the existence of a syndrome (namely the \"dysplasia of the fibrous sheath\") of possible familial transmission.\r"

Laparoscopic records were reviewed to correlate laparoscopic sites of occlusion with those found at the time of microsurgery.

  ".W": "Ectopic implantation usually begins with relatively normal growth of trophoblast and serum beta-hCG progression. However, the trophoblast eventually erodes into vessels and a variable degree of bleeding and hematoma compromises its growth. The serum beta-hCG level then usually begins to demonstrate some degree of abnormal progression. For our patients, the length of the ectopic pregnancy varied widely, depending mainly on when the individual patient chose to seek medical treatment. Infertility patients followed from the moment of conception would thus be expected to show a better correlation between early beta-hCG levels and the size of the tubal pregnancy. Preconditions for the operative laparoscopic management of a tubal pregnancy usually include that the tube be unruptured, less than 3 cm in diameter, and readily accessible via the laparoscopic approach. Ackerman et al. suggested there was a general correlation between the serum beta-hCG level and tubal rupture, and the present data demonstrate an overall positive correlation between the size of the tubal pregnancy and the serum level. However, the range of levels is so broad for any given size of mass or tubal status that this correlation is not meaningful clinically. A reliable method to determine the size and status of a tubal pregnancy before laparoscopy would be valuable. Unfortunately, we did not find the preoperative serum beta-hCG level to be useful for making this prediction.\r"

To further delineate this finding, medium incubated with killed macrophages, heat-inactivated medium, and various concentrations of macrophage media were added to the SPA. Analysis of the data implied that there is a 1.536% decrease in penetration for every 1% increase in the concentration of PFM medium. Heat-inactivated medium and medium incubated with dead PFM both produced penetrations statistically different from the control. We conclude that medium incubated with PFM is capable of decreasing sperm penetration as measured in the SPA in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, the substance responsible for this decrease appears to be heat-stable and released from dead as well as live macrophages.\r"

The neuropathic diabetic patients had a reduced flare response to substance P, histamine, and capsaicin, compared with control and nonneuropathic diabetic subjects. The smaller flare response in the neuropathic diabetics after capsaicin administration suggested a dysfunction of the peripheral component of the C-fiber. Alternatively, dysfunction of the mast cell or vascular reactivity may contribute to the diminished flare. Because C-fibers participate in nociception in addition to the flare response, the findings of this study, by a method that permits a quantifiable measurement of the function of peripheral sensory neurons in diabetic subjects, has potential usefulness in evaluating sensory neuropathy in diabetic patients.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of glucose and diabetes on the high-affinity lofentanil-displaceable opiate-receptor binding in mouse brain membranes were studied to determine if the attenuation of opiate actions by hyperglycemia previously observed in our laboratory was due to a modification of receptor affinity or number. With membranes from normal ICR mice, glucose (100-400 mg/dl) caused small but significant concentration-dependent decreases in receptor affinities for [3H]naloxone and [3H]dihydromorphine, both in the absence and presence of 20 mM NaCl, without changing the maximum number of binding sites. Fructose and the nonmetabolizable sugar 3-O-methylglucose had intermediate effects on naloxone affinity in the presence of NaCl that were not significantly different from control or from the effect of glucose. Similar results were obtained with brain membranes from streptozocin-induced diabetic mice. The binding affinity for [3H]naloxone in the presence of NaCl was not affected by the induction of diabetes in ICR mice via streptozocin or in spontaneously diabetic (db/db) C57BL/KsJ mice compared with their nondiabetic (m+/m+) littermates. These results indicate that the previously observed attenuation of opiate effects by glucose may be partly due to a glucose-induced decrease in opiate-receptor affinity. However, the much greater attenuation of morphine by fructose in vivo cannot be explained by this mechanism.\r"

The antiepileptic agent trimethadione was given orally to 13 dogs at a dose of 1.0-1.5 g daily. Pancreatic calculi disappeared in 13 of 15 observations. The scanning electron microscopy, the elemental analysis, and the powder x-ray diffractometry of pancreatic calculi in this model revealed that the calculi closely resembled human pancreatic calculi, consisting mainly of a calcite of calcium carbonate. There was no histologic finding suggesting drug toxicity in the liver, the kidney, and the blood. Pancreatic calculi in 6 control dogs without the treatment neither disappeared nor diminished spontaneously. The oral treatment with trimethadione may have potential for dissolving human pancreatic calculi.\r"

A retrospective review of Mayo Clinic records from a 6-yr period just before the advent of colonoscopy identified 226 patients with colonic polyps greater than or equal to 10 mm in diameter in whom periodic radiographic examination of the colon was elected over excisional therapy. In all patients, follow-up of polyps spanned at least 12 mo (mean, 68 mo; range, 12-229 mo) and included at least two barium enema examinations (mean, 5.2; range, 2-17). During the follow-up period, 83 polyps (37%) enlarged. Twenty-one invasive carcinomas were identified at the site of the index polyp at a mean follow-up of 108 mo (range, 24-225 mo). Actuarial analysis revealed that the cumulative risk of diagnosis of cancer at the polyp site at 5, 10, and 20 yr was 2.5%, 8%, and 24%, respectively. In addition, 11 invasive cancers were found at a site remote from the index polyp during the same follow-up period. These data further support the recommendation for excision of all colonic polyps greater than or equal to 10 mm in diameter. Periodic examination of the entire colon is recommended in this group of patients to identify neoplasms arising at a site remote from the index polyp. Although this study has limitations inherent to any retrospective analysis, comparable prospective data are unlikely to be available in the future because of the current widespread availability of colonoscopy.\r"

  ".W": "Dietary purines and pyrimidines are not considered to have a nutritional role, much less a direct effect on the functioning of the gastrointestinal tract. We found that a dramatic decrease in adult rat small intestinal and colonic total ribonucleic acid (RNA) results from the removal of dietary purines and pyrimidines or the administration of 6-mercaptopurine. Ribonucleic acid hybridization analysis indicated specific decrease of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for the purine salvage enzymes hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase and adenine phosphoribosyl transferase in the small intestine and proximal colon but not in the liver of animals fed a diet lacking purines and pyrimidines. Levels of intestinal and hepatic beta-actin mRNA transcripts were generally not depressed by either diet or by the administration of 6-mercaptopurine. Liver hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase and adenine phosphoribosyl transferase mRNAs were unaffected by the change in diet but were lowered by the administration of 6-mercaptopurine. These data indicate that nutrition and 6-mercaptopurine affect both total RNA, and individual mRNA concentrations at specific sites in the gastrointestinal tract. These findings are of potentially great significance because the regulation of intestinal total RNA levels and purine salvage mRNAs by both 6-mercaptopurine and a purine- and pyrimidine-free diet suggests a potential mechanism by which dietary components differentially control specific proteins synthesized in the body. These findings may be related to the efficacy of 6-mercaptopurine as well as so-called elemental diets as therapeutic agents in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (i.e., Crohn's disease).\r"

The cancer family syndrome type of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma emerged as the most common verifiable risk factor for colon cancer involving 3.8%-5.5% of all colorectal carcinoma patients in this study. The frequencies of familial adenomatosis and ulcerative colitis were 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively. As the diagnostic method of this study was based on the family history of the patients, only those families with inherited cancer cases in two or more generations could be identified. The cancer family syndrome cannot be diagnosed on the basis of a single patient, and so the observed frequency of 4%-6% for the syndrome may still represent an underestimate. The patients with cancer family syndrome were young, accounting for 29%-39% of the patients under 50 yr of age, and their tumors were located predominantly (65%) in the right hemicolon. The high frequency of hereditary cases among colorectal carcinoma patients indicates the importance of studying the family history of every new patient.\r"

Thus, we measured simultaneously throughout the interdigestive motor cycle (a) antroduodenal pressure activity by manometry, (b) antroduodenal resistance by a pneumatic resistometer, and (c) bile acid concentrations in duodenal and gastric juices. Experiments were performed in 15 conscious dogs (9 with pylorus intact and 6 with extramucosal pyloric myotomy). We found that antroduodenal resistance was lowest during phase I, increased gradually during phase II, and peaked during phase III (linear trend, p less than 0.001). Duodenogastric bile reflux was low during phase I, peaked during late phase II, and decreased again during phase III (quadratic trend, p less than 0.05). Therefore, variations in net resistance and reflux were differently related to the phases of the interdigestive motor complex. Pyloric myotomy significantly decreased antroduodenal resistance (linear trend different from control, p less than 0.001), but had no significant effect on duodenogastric bile reflux. We conclude (a) that changes in net antroduodenal resistance do not regulate duodenogastric bile reflux and (b) that the pylorus is an important determinant of antroduodenal resistance, but has no major role in the control of fasting duodenogastric bile reflux.\r"

Arteriovenous oxygen difference, mucosal pH, and total, mucosal, and muscularis blood flow were monitored continuously. Pentagastrin increased acid secretion, oxygen consumption, and both total and mucosal blood flow. Before and after pentagastrin, the magnitude of reactive hyperemia was correlated with the occlusion duration. During stepwise reductions in perfusion pressure, oxygen consumption was relatively constant and blood flow-independent over most of the pressure range. Mucosal blood flow was well maintained except at the lowest perfusion pressure. Pentagastrin did not enhance autoregulation in the mucosa or muscularis, but did enhance the autoregulation of total blood flow. A myogenic vasoconstriction occurred during 20-mmHg venous pressure elevations. Our results indicate that both metabolic and myogenic mechanisms regulate the gastric mucosal circulation.\r"

Plasma GABA-like activity was significantly increased in rats with thioacetamide-induced hepatic encephalopathy compared with rats injected with vehicle alone (1506 +/- 993 nM, n = 7 vs. 367 +/- 97 nM, n = 9, mean +/- SD; p less than 0.001). In contrast, there were no alterations in either brain GABA receptor binding or in GABA-enhanced benzodiazepine binding in rats with hepatic encephalopathy when compared with relevant controls. However, rats that had received intraperitoneal injections of thioacetamide or vehicle (0.15 M NaCl) had significantly more low-affinity GABA receptors than rats that had neither been injected nor handled before killing (8769 +/- 1101 vs. 2710 +/- 757 fmol/mg protein, mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001). We concluded that stress factors appear to be important causes of altered brain GABA binding.

Hepatic protoporphyrin metabolism was found to increase linearly as a function of protoporphyrin dose in livers infused with and without taurocholate (0.7 mumol/min), but their rates differed significantly. Employing a standard 1500-nmol protoporphyrin bolus dose, infusions (0.7 mumol/min) of taurocholate, glycocholate, deoxycholate, and chenodeoxycholate, but not tauroursodeoxycholate or ursodeoxycholate, increased protoporphyrin metabolism 1.7- to 2.7-fold over control (0 bile acid) values. Bile acid infusion ranging from 0.175 to 1.4 mumol/min confirmed that both taurocholate and chenodeoxycholate increased protoporphyrin disposal significantly more than ursodeoxycholate. For all bile acids, the increase of protoporphyrin metabolism was most pronounced between biliary bile acid excretion rates of 10-50 nmol/min.g liver. These data indicate that (a) bile acids facilitated protoporphyrin metabolism, (b) bile acid structure influenced the effect, and (c) ursodeoxycholate may not be a prime candidate to study the role of bile acids in the treatment of protoporphyria.\r"

The hepatic receptor-dependent and receptor-independent uptake of LDL was related to both bile flow and biliary lipid secretion. The correlation with bile flow and biliary lipid secretion was positive for the receptor-dependent, but negative for the receptor-independent uptake of LDL. Although the receptor-mediated LDL uptake appeared to exert a strong influence on bile acid-independent bile flow, the receptor-independent uptake showed a significant relation with biliary bile acid excretion. Differences between the two mechanisms of LDL uptake were also evident in the biliary bile acid-cholesterol coupling, which was significantly stronger during receptor-independent than during receptor-dependent uptake of LDL. The effects of LDL uptake on bile secretion were modulated by the experimentally induced changes in both the content and composition of bile acids in the enterohepatic circulation.\r"

Although the absence of apo B from the intestine has been shown by immunofluorescence, the antiserum used was raised against low-density lipoprotein apo B. Therefore, the precise nature of the underlying defect remains unknown, given that the postulated gene mutation could prevent the synthesis of the molecular form of apo B specific for chylomicrons, apo B-48, or produce an unstable aberrant form of apo B particle. This report concerns 2 girls aged 5.5 and 4.75 with well-documented clinical and biological manifestations of the disease in whom there was no immunologically detectable plasma apo B-48 and apo B-100. Their cultured jejunal explants incubated with [14C]palmitate showed slight decrease in the esterification of triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesteryl esters. However, only traces of triglycerides and small amounts of cholesteryl esters were found in the culture medium in contrast to phospholipids, which were readily exported. Protein synthesis as assessed by [3H]leucine incorporation by explants was normal and only modestly diminished in the fat chylomicronlike fraction floated from the sonicated explants. However, there was no radioactivity at the electrophoretic position of apo B-100 and apo B-48. Immunologic confirmation of the absence of these two apoproteins was obtained by Western blots. These data confirm the hypothesis that in certain cases of abetalipoproteinemia the intestinal defect results from the lack of synthesis of apo B-48.\r"

  ".U": "88005672\r", 
  ".W": "Human ileal brush border membrane vesicles were prepared from intestines obtained from cadaveric renal allograft donors. The energetics and kinetics of taurocholate transport were studied. Fifty-five percent of equilibrium uptake (picomoles per mg protein) resulted from binding to the vesicle surface or incorporation into an osmotically insensitive compartment. The initial rate of transport was stimulated fourfold by an inwardly directed Na+ gradient when compared with a K+ gradient, and cation gradient-dependent differences persisted throughout the initial 5 min of incubation (p less than 0.05). Taurocholate uptake was half-maximally stimulated by a Na+ concentration of 23 +/- 4 mM. A Hill transformation of this plot gave a slope (n) of 0.97, indicating a 1:1 (mol/mol) Na+-taurocholate coupling ratio. Generation of a negative inside diffusion potential by anion substitution or valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential failed to alter bile salt uptake, suggesting an electroneutral transport mechanism. When Na+-dependent uptake velocity (10 s) was examined over a range of taurocholate concentration (0.036-0.9 mM), the plot described a rectangular hyperbola. The mean apparent Michaelis constant was 0.037 +/- 0.007 mM and maximum velocity was 1093 +/- 329 pmol taurocholate per milligram protein per 10 s. These data confirm and extend animal studies of ileal bile salt transport. Taurocholate uptake by the human ileal brush border occurs by a Na+-dependent, carrier-mediated electroneutral mechanism. According to this model, a single Na ion is coupled with a single taurocholate anion and transported across the brush border by a carrier mechanism that is driven by a transmembrane Na+ gradient.\r"

  ".W": "The transit of a radiolabeled meal through the gastrointestinal tract and stool output were measured in 62 patients with ulcerative colitis, subdivided according to the activity and extent of their disease. The results were compared with those from 20 sex-matched normal subjects. Mouth-to-cecum transit was significantly slower than normal in all patient groups although gastric emptying was normal. Whole gut transit was not accelerated in any group of patients. An abdominal x-ray taken 48 h after ingesting the meal showed that patients with active colitis had proximal colonic stasis, whereas transit through the rectosigmoid region was rapid. Stool weights and frequencies were higher in patients with active colitis than in patients with quiescent disease. Patients with active colitis also passed smaller amounts of stool during each bowel movement, suggesting that they experienced a desire to defecate at lower rectal volumes. These results indicate that (a) diarrhea in ulcerative colitis is associated with rectosigmoid irritability rather than rapid transit and (b) caution should be used when treating active colitis with antidiarrheal drugs that could further retard proximal colonic transit.\r"

Vaccine programs have evaluated animal rotavirus strains that are attenuated in humans but antigenically similar to some human strains. Whether a single vaccine strain can elicit protective immunity in humans to rotaviruses of the same or different serotypes is an important question in determining vaccine efficacy. We used characterized serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies directed at VP7 in a competitive solid-phase immunoassay to measure epitope-specific immune responses to serotypes 1, 2, and 3 in sera of children who received a candidate serotype-3 rotavirus vaccine. Antibodies to serotype 3 were detected in 72% of sera samples, and to serotype 1 and 2 in only 11% each. Also, a VP3-specific monoclonal antibody which neutralizes three serotypically distinct strains of rotavirus was used to detect the presence of similar antibodies in 56% of the test sera. This finding suggests a mechanism of heterotypic immunity.\r"

Single muscle cells were anchored to the ceiling of a minichamber and their contraction was measured in response to acetylcholine, alone and in combination with three muscarinic antagonists: atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP), and pirenzepine. Estimates of the inhibitory dissociation constants (Ki) were closely similar in human and guinea pig muscle cells (atropine 2.5-5 X 10(-11) M, 4-DAMP 1.9-2.9 X 10(10) M, and pirenzepine 8.2-9.5 X 10(-8) M). Thus, pirenzepine, a preferential M1 antagonist, was 1900-3280 times less potent than atropine and 279-500 times less potent than 4-DAMP. Comparative measurements on longitudinal muscle strips from guinea pig jejunum confirmed the greater potency of atropine and 4-DAMP relative to pirenzepine. Inactivation of muscarinic receptors on single muscle cells with dibenamine showed that only a small fraction of receptors was responsible for the response to acetylcholine. It was concluded that intestinal muscle cells contain a large reservoir of muscarinic M2 receptors that exhibit considerable spareness and heterogeneity.\r"

We have undertaken a multidisciplinary study of 8 patients with anorexia nervosa and 8 age- and sex-matched controls. We have characterized their gastrointestinal and neurohormonal function by measuring (a) gastric electrical activity, (b) antral phasic pressure activity, (c) gastric emptying of solids and liquids, and (d) hormonal and autonomic function. Patients with anorexia nervosa at the time of the initiation of therapy presented with (a) increased episodes of gastric dysrhythmia (mean percentage of dysrhythmic time: 9.75 patients vs. 0.48 controls during fasting, p less than 0.02; 7.21 patients vs. 0.18 controls postcibally, p less than 0.001), (b) impaired antral contractility (mean motility index, 12.8 patients vs. 14.2 controls, p less than 0.002), (c) delayed emptying of solids, (d) decreased postcibal blood levels of norepinephrine and neurotensin (levels of beta-endorphin, insulin, glucagon, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, gastrin, cholecystokinin, and human pancreatic polypeptide were normal), and (e) impaired autonomic function (resting diastolic blood pressure and skin conductance were decreased and the response to the cold pressor test was dampened). Differences between patient and control groups were statistically significant. We conclude that patients with anorexia nervosa present multiple gastrointestinal abnormalities involving control mechanisms as well as target organs.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of vitamin E deficiency during chronic childhood cholestasis is hampered by the poor intestinal absorption of available oral preparations of vitamin E when bile flow is severely impaired; thus parenteral vitamin E has been the only effective therapy for many children with this problem. We studied the intestinal absorption, efficacy, and safety of a water-soluble oral form of vitamin E, d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), in 22 children (7 mo to 19 yr old) with severe cholestasis and vitamin E deficiency who were unresponsive to massive oral doses (100-200 IU/kg.day) of dl-alpha-tocopherol. The results of oral vitamin E tolerance tests showed that TPGS was well absorbed in virtually all study subjects, that TPGS intestinal absorption was superior to that of dl-alpha-tocopherol, and that TPGS absorption in teenage children with chronic cholestasis was similar to that of normal adults. In addition, 1.7% +/- 1.6% (mean +/- SD) of the administered polyethylene glycol 1000 contained in the TPGS was absorbed and excreted in the urine of the 13 subjects analyzed, compared with 3.0% +/- 1.3% in 4 normal adults. A chronic oral dose of 15-25 IU/kg.day of TPGS corrected the biochemical vitamin E deficiency state over 1-19 mo (mean, 10.6 mo) of TPGS therapy. No clinical or biochemical evidence of gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, or hematologic toxicity was demonstrated. This study suggests that TPGS administered orally in a dose of 15-25 IU/kg.day may be a safe and effective form of vitamin E for prevention and correction of vitamin E deficiency during severe childhood cholestasis.\r"

Affected animals comprised 17 German shepherd dogs with chronic diarrhea or weight loss, or both. Analysis of duodenal juice demonstrated aerobic overgrowth in 10 cases, most frequently comprising enterococci and Escherichia coli, and obligate anaerobic overgrowth in 7 cases, most frequently including Clostridia spp. Histologic changes were minimal; however, examination of peroral jejunal biopsy specimens by sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed specific biochemical abnormalities. In the dogs with aerobic overgrowth, there was a selective loss of brush border alkaline phosphatase activity, and gamma-glutamyl transferase activity was increased, whereas activities of disaccharidases and aminopeptidase N were unaltered. In contrast, anaerobic overgrowth was associated with a reduction in brush border density, indicative of a considerable fall in the glycoprotein-to-lipid ratio of the brush border membrane, whereas brush border enzyme activities were unaltered. There was a loss of peroxisomal catalase activity in dogs with aerobic overgrowth, and an indication of mitochondrial disruption in dogs with anaerobic overgrowth, but little evidence for damage to other subcellular organelles. These findings demonstrate that aerobic and anaerobic overgrowth may be associated with distinct but different mucosal abnormalities particularly affecting the brush border membrane.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma gastrin and somatostatin responses to ingestion of a solid meal, to insulin hypoglycemia, and to intravenous infusion of gastrin-releasing peptide were measured in 4 conscious dogs with and without bilateral cryogenic blockade of the cervical vagus nerves. Vagal cooling to -2 degrees C abolished meal-stimulated rises in plasma gastrin and somatostatin. Atropine did not modify the gastrin response to cooling but bethanechol reduced the magnitude of inhibition to 37% +/- 9% without influencing plasma somatostatin. Gastrin-releasing peptide elevated postprandial plasma gastrin during vagal blockade to levels comparable to those with the vagus intact but did not alter the nadir plasma somatostatin response. The plasma gastrin and somatostatin rises associated with insulin hypoglycemia were similarly inhibited by cooling to -2 degrees C. Cooling to 12 degrees C, which selectively blocks vagal inhibitory pathways, had no effect on meal-stimulated gastrin release and partially decreased the plasma gastrin response to insulin hypoglycemia. Thus, gastrin release by food and by insulin hypoglycemia is mediated by a vagal nonmuscarinic excitatory pathway that is independent of changes in circulating plasma somatostatin but may include participation by the candidate neurotransmitter gastrin-releasing peptide.\r"

The reflectance spectrophotometric finding that experimentally induced prehepatic portal hypertension did not affect gastric mucosal blood flow was confirmed by hydrogen gas clearance measurements. Endoscopic studies in patients with active duodenal ulcer disease revealed a higher index of mucosal hemoglobin concentration and a normal index of oxygen saturation (i.e., an increase in blood flow) at the margin of the ulcer compared with the adjacent normal appearing mucosa.\r"

Those with focal lesions on CT were randomized to either a CT or laparoscopic directed biopsy. Patients with no lesions on CT had laparoscopy for further evaluation. The results indicate that blind percutaneous biopsy is sufficient if extensive right lobe disease is present. There is no significant difference in the sensitivity of laparoscopy and CT directed biopsy if focal lesions are detected by CT. However, a negative CT directed biopsy does not exclude malignancy. Laparoscopy has a significant yield in patients with a negative CT and is the procedure of choice in evaluating these patients.\r"

In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of the determination of gastric juice pH by means of litmus paper. Values obtained by this method correlate well with gastric acid secretory capacity as measured by gastric acid analysis (r = -0.64, p less than 0.001) and are not affected by the presence of bile. Gastric juice pH determination increases sensitivity and other diagnostic parameters such as performance index (Youden J test), positive predictive value, and post-test probability difference by 50%. Furthermore, the negative predictive value is very high, the probability of missing a patient with chronic atrophic gastritis with this simple method being 2% for fundic and 15% for antral atrophic change. We conclude that gastric juice pH determination, which substantially increases diagnostic accuracy and is very simple to perform, should be routinely adopted.\r"

Mitral valve prolapse, usually considered a benign disorder in the young and middle-aged, may present with heart failure in the elderly, and mitral valve surgery may be necessary. Instead of angina pectoris, dyspnea may be the first manifestation of coronary artery disease in the elderly. Acute myocardial infarction may be silent or present in an atypical manner with abdominal distress, acute signs of cerebral insufficiency, or dyspnea.\r"

Follow up endoscopy and laser treatment was at four week intervals, unless the clinical or endoscopic results indicated otherwise. The immediate result was to allow 32% of patients to swallow anything they liked, a further 54% were able to take most solids and 9% were improved, or maintained on liquids only. The mortality of laser recanalisation and associated treatment was 5%. The improvement in swallowing was maintained until death in all but 15% of these patients, some of the 15% needed intubation to allow adequate swallowing. Endoscopic, or surgical intubation was required immediately in five patients after an initial laser course failed to provide improvement. The mean survival of the whole group was 19 weeks (range one to 112 weeks).\r"

Thirty four patients considered unsuitable for surgery because of advanced malignancy, other major pathology or in whom previous surgery had been unsuccessful were treated endoscopically with the Nd YAG laser. Significant improvement was achieved in 29 (85%). On a scale of 0-4 (0 = normal swallowing; 4 = dysphagia for all fluids), mean improvement was 1.7, with 25 patients (74%) able to swallow most, or all solids after treatment. With increasing experience, the average number of treatment sessions required for each patient became less; initial time in hospital became comparable to that needed for intubation. Failures were caused by inappropriate patient selection (3), or laser related perforation (2). The mean survival in the whole group was 19 weeks (range 2-44). Eighteen patients needed further treatment for recurrent dysphagia, a mean of six weeks (range 2-15) after initial therapy. Ten of these responded, but eight eventually required insertion of a prosthetic tube. The duration of good palliation was very variable after initial laser therapy.\r"

Animals received the first of five weekly injections of azoxymethane (total dose 50 mg/kg) either immediately after transection of the descending colon or at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks later; controls received handling of the bowel alone. Crypt cell proliferation was assessed by autoradiography following 3HTdR injection. An overall increase in tumour yields in all transection groups was due solely to the frequent presence of anastomotic tumours. Changes in crypt morphometry and labelling index were most marked in crypt positions 1-10 away from the anastomosis. Crypts at this site increased in height at 2, 4, and 8 weeks (p less than 0.001) but returned to normal values by 12 weeks. Likewise, labelling index was increased at 2, 4, and 8 weeks (p less than 0.001) and remained higher at 12 weeks (p less than 0.05). Increased crypt cell proliferation in the immediate vicinity of an apparently 'healed' colonic anastomosis may explain its persisting susceptibility to carcinogenesis.\r"

The permeability was determined by feeding young rats a mixture of bovine serum albumin, bovine immunoglobulin G and fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran 70,000, and analysing the serum concentrations after six hours. The animals were then killed and the intestinal mucosa was homogenised and assessed for PLA2 and lysoPC-metabolising enzyme activities. The intestine was 'open' to the macromolecules in 14 day old animals, but 'closed' in 22 and 32 day old animals and in 14 day old rats treated with cortisone acetate on day 10, 11, and 12 postpartum. The activity of PLA2 (at pH 6 and 2 mM Ca2+) was higher in 32, 22, and cortisone treated 14 day old animals, than in untreated, 14 day old animals. Incubation of 14C-acyl-lysoPC with mucosa from 14 day old rats did not change the radioactivity pattern as shown by thin layer chromatography, whereas after incubation with mucosa from 22 or 32 day old animals all the radiolabel was found in free 14C-fatty acid and in 14C-phosphatidylcholine. These findings indicate that mucosal PLA2 activity increases during intestinal maturation and that the mucosa acquires the ability to acylate and deacylate lysoPC when it is 'closed' to macromolecules.\r"

This coat, in places 1.6 mm thick (median thickness 680 microns), was 10 times thicker than the translucent layer of adherent mucus (median thickness 70 microns) covering the undamaged mucosa. Immunohistochemistry and periodic acid Schiff staining showed this gelatinous coat to be predominantly a fibrin gel with an exterior layer rich in mucus and necrotic cells. The plasma clotting time was significantly decreased in vitro by pig gastric mucus gel and soluble mucus glycoprotein (90% and 13% respectively) suggesting that in vivo the mucus layer remaining after epithelial damage could act as a template for fibrinogen-fibrin conversion. These results show that a fibrin based gelatinous coat, quite distinct from the adherent mucus layer and with considerable protective potential could be formed over the repairing rat gastric mucosa after acute ethanol damage.\r"

  ".U": "88005884\r", 
  ".W": "Cisapride is a synthetic drug which binds, in vitro, to type 2 serotonin receptors. We examined the influence of serotonin and cisapride on ion transport across intestinal mucosa in vitro and studied the effect of cisapride on the response to serotonin. Segments of ileum of male Sprague-Dawley rats were stripped of muscle layers and mounted in flux chambers. The addition of serotonin (10(-8) to 10(-4) M) to the serosal aspect of the mucosa caused a rapid, dose-dependent rise in short circuit current and transmural potential difference. Cisapride alone (5 X 10(-5) M), when added to the mucosal and serosal surfaces, had no effect on the short circuit current, transmural potential difference, resistance, or sodium and chloride fluxes across the mucosa. It did, however, inhibit the response of the mucosa to serotonin (10(-5) M) in a dose dependent manner and blocked it completely at a concentration of 5 X 10(-5) M. Serotonin (5 X 10(-5) M) increased serosal to mucosal flux of chloride from 12.6 +/- 0.8 to 15.2 +/- 0.6 mumol/cm2/h (p less than 0.025), thus reducing net chloride absorption from 4.65 +/- 0.81 to 1.49 +/- 1.04 mumol/cm2/h (p less than 0.05). This effect was completely blocked by cisapride (5 X 10(-5) M). In summary, cisapride inhibits the effect of serotonin on rat ileal ion transport, probably by blocking type 2 serotonin receptors.\r"

Results were compared with the distribution of a labelled test meal in the gastrointestinal tract of rats killed at different time intervals after gavage. Values for stomach to caecum transit were compatible with the distribution of labelled meals in 91% of animals, although in the remainder the hydrogen concentration had not risen even though food residues were in the caecum when the animals were killed. The technique gave reproducible results; the coefficients of variation for four studies carried out in each of six animals varied between 4 and 14%. A meal consisting of homogenised baked beans had a significantly shorter stomach to caecum transit time (88.1 +/- 4.5 min; mean +/- SE; n = 21; p less than 0.001) than an equivalent volume of Complan/lactulose (180.9 +/- 8.7 min; n = 13). This technique was used to investigate the effect of ileal infusion of a fat emulsion (20% Intralipid) via a chronically implanted intestinal cannula on the stomach to caecum transit time of a bean meal, in a series of paired studies carried out in six rats. Stomach to caecum transit time was significantly delayed during ileal infusion of 20% Intralipid compared with the control infusion of an isotonic saline solution (218.3 +/- 21 min v 106.7 +/- 33 min Intralipid v saline; n = 6; p less than 0.001).\r"

A non-invasive double isotope technique was used to investigate these relationships in 27 patients with a duodenal ulcer, before and after operation-truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty (TV + P; n = 15) and highly selective vagotomy (HSV; n = 12). A further 25 patients were studied after operation (TV + P, n = 20: HSV, n = 5). 99Tcm-EHIDA was used as the biliary tracer and 113Inm bran as the gastric content tracer. In patients with a duodenal ulcer before surgery and in 16 of the 17 patients studied after HSV, the patterns of gall bladder emptying were similar to those previously found in normal subjects. In 60% of patients after TV + P, patterns of gall bladder emptying were altered and the onset of gall bladder emptying was significantly delayed (p less than 0.001) compared with unoperated patients and patients with a HSV. The rate of gall bladder emptying did not correlate with the rate of gastric emptying in any of the patients studied. These observations suggest that TV + P, but not HSV, causes considerable alteration in coordination of gall bladder and gastric emptying.\r"

On a control day, gastric and duodenal motor activity was recorded for nine hours of fasting and for four hours after a meal, duodeno-caecal transit being assessed in both interdigestive and digestive states. Motor activity and transit were also measured on a test day during which the rectum was distended for one hour during fasting and for one hour postprandially. Control and test days were randomised. During fasting, rectal distension increased the incidence of migrating motor complexes (0.8 +/- 0.3 v 0.5 +/- 0.2 h; p less than 0.01) and reduced the duodenal phase 2 motility index to 66 +/- 45% of that observed on the control day (p less than 0.01). Further, duodeno-caecal transit time was increased by rectal distension (99 +/- 30 v 71 +/- 35 min; p less than 0.05). Postprandially, the period of rectal distension was marked by a reduction in the duodenal motility index to 24 +/- 13% of that observed during the comparable period on the control day (p less than 0.001) and a concomitant increase in duodeno-caecal transit time (113 +/- 22 v 80 +/- 17 min; p less than 0.01). We conclude that upper gastrointestinal motor activity, the effector of luminal transit, may be profoundly influenced by stimulation of distal afferents.\r"

Mucosal samples of caecum, colon ascendens, and transversum were also investigated. The amount of calcium binding protein per milligram of cytosolic protein increased throughout duodenum to reach the maximum in the proximal segment of jejunum and then declined steadily to nearly undetectable levels in ileum. In the colon no 10,000 molecular weight CaBP was detectable. The distribution of CaBP along the small and large intestine of man is thus parallel to the efficiency of the active calcium absorption of human intestine.\r"

Before dilatation an abnormally high percentage acid exposure time was present but typical episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred in only one patient. In nine patients who had a oesophageal food residue these values were significantly greater than those found in the remaining patients without retained food. Analysis of oesophageal food residues revealed that the low pH was predominantly caused by lactic acid. These findings indicate that preoperative oesophageal pH studies do not offer a valid means of selection of patients in whom an antireflux procedure should be combined with cardiomyotomy. Repeat studies one week after pneumatic dilatation showed a fall in the acid exposure time in patients with initial food residue presumably resulting from improved oesophageal emptying after treatment. A significant rise in acid exposure time after dilatation was seen in those patients without initial food residue presumably resulting from gastro-oesophageal reflux after therapeutic disruption of the lower oesophageal sphincter. Troublesome symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux were, however, uncommon after bag dilatation.\r"

In this placebo controlled, double blind, randomised study mean peptone stimulated gastric acid secretion (mean +/- SEM) of 10 male healthy subjects (58 +/- 6 mmol H+/3 h for placebo) was significantly and dose dependently inhibited by oral telenzepine (2 mg: 31 +/- 5, 3 mg: 23 +/- 5, 5 mg: 21 +/- 4 mmol H+/3 h). Telenzepine 3 and 5 mg were significantly stronger than pirenzepine 50 mg orally (37 +/- 8 mmol H+/3 h). Mean percentage acid inhibition was 37% for pirenzepine, and 48, 61, and 64% for 2, 3, and 5 mg telenzepine, respectively. Basal and peptone stimulated gastrin release was unaffected. Mean salivary output per three hours declined moderately from 156 +/- 45 g (placebo) to 136 +/- 45 g with pirenzepine and significantly to 88 +/- 28 g, 95 +/- 39 g and 39 +/- 13 g with telenzepine 2, 3, and 5 mg, respectively. There was a parallel effect on Na+, K+, Ca++ and amylase output in saliva. Near point vision was not altered by either drug. Pulse rates were lowered by both substances. Complaints of dry mouth were more frequent with telenzepine 5 mg. On a molar basis telenzepine proved to be a 25 and 50 times more potent inhibitor of gastric and salivary secretion, respectively.\r"

For this purpose, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid gamma-aminobutyric acid levels were measured by means of mass fragmentography in 17 cirrhotic patients with hepatic encephalopathy and in 6 cirrhotics without neurological symptoms. Moreover, in all patients, a second sample was obtained during the clinical course of hepatic encephalopathy. The mean plasma and cerebrospinal fluid gamma-aminobutyric acid levels were not different in patients with or without hepatic encephalopathy and did not change during the evolution of the neurological symptoms. The lack of changes in the gamma-aminobutyric acid content in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid during hepatic encephalopathy is in contrast with the hypothesized importance of increased entry into the brain of gamma-aminobutyric acid in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

  ".W": "The pattern of copper distribution in human newborn liver was investigated by histochemical methods (rhodamine, orcein and rubeanic acid) and by atomic absorption spectroscopy. A significant correlation (p less than 0.005) was found between the degree of histochemical positivity and the copper concentration found by atomic absorption spectroscopy. In the majority of the 30 livers examined (first group), the copper concentration was much higher than that of normal adult liver, although exhibiting striking individual differences. No correlation between the copper content and sex, body weight or gestational age was found. From a second group of five livers, longitudinal tissue slices 0.5 cm thick were partitioned into regular blocks of about 0.5 gm, which were individually analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Copper appeared unevenly distributed within each liver, with marked differences even between adjacent blocks. However, a consistent tendency of copper to accumulate in the left lobe more than in the right one was evident. Five additional blocks, one for each liver, were further partitioned into 10 small specimens of a final size (0.05 gm), comparable to that of a needle biopsy. Even at this sampling level, consisting of tissue fragments taken from a small tissue area, the copper concentration appeared quite irregularly distributed. These findings may be considered for two different aspects: (a) the biological implications of the pattern of copper accumulation in different lobar and lobular liver compartments and (b) the statistical inference, for diagnostic purposes, of the mean liver copper content from measurements of single percutaneous biopsy specimens.\r"

  ".U": "88006062\r", 
  ".W": "Inhibition of a major hepatic form of human cationic glutathione S-transferase by bilirubin, biliverdin, indocyanine green and chenodeoxycholic acid was investigated as a function of pH (range = 6.5 to 9.1). Changes in pH had little effect on the extent of inhibition by indocyanine green. However, inhibition by bilirubin, biliverdin and chenodeoxycholic acid was found to be pH-dependent, with markedly less inhibition at the high values of pH. The reduced inhibition at the high values of pH could not be ascribed to a failure of the enzyme to bind the nonsubstrate ligand. Instead, the complete inhibition observed at pH 6.5 became partial (hyperbolic) inhibition at pH 9.1. This behavior can be ascribed to the binding of the nonsubstrate ligands at a site other than the active site, i.e., at high values of pH there is formation of an enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex which still retains considerable catalytic activity. At physiologic values of pH (7.0), the human transferase was completely inhibited by saturating concentrations of the tested nonsubstrate ligands. This is in contrast to our previous studies performed with the rat transferases where, although inhibition also was affected by buffer pH, some forms of the enzyme retained significant catalytic activity at pH 7.0 despite high concentrations of nonsubstrate ligands. We conclude that the ability of the human cationic glutathione S-transferases to serve as enzymes of detoxification in the presence of high intracellular concentrations of nonsubstrate ligands may be significantly reduced, and this may render the cholestatic liver unusually susceptible to injury by toxic electrophiles.\r"

  ".W": "We studied a possible acinar heterogeneity in the transport of organic cations, using rhodamine B as model compound. Employing perfusions of isolated rat livers in the ante- and retrograde mode and quantitative fluorescence microscopy, Zones 1 and 3 were shown to be equally efficient in taking up rhodamine B. Ten minutes after injection in an antegrade perfusion, 95% of the dose was localized in the portal half of the acinus. Fifty minutes later, however, the amount of rhodamine B in Zone 1 had been reduced to 23%; 30 and 31% were in Zones 2 and 3, respectively, and the medium concentration was doubled. Thus, unchanged rhodamine B appeared to be transported downstream within the liver, either via the medium or directly from cell to cell, finally resulting in a relatively higher rhodamine B concentration in Zone 3. To obtain additional data, we designed a perfusion setup in which the zones could be studied separately. In both zones, the amount excreted into the medium was about 30 times the amount excreted into bile. Intracellular sequestration of rhodamine B and the rate constant for sinusoidal secretion were higher in Zone 3, while the sinusoidal uptake rates were equal; biliary excretion was higher in Zone 1. Acinar distribution changed with time because rhodamine B, primarily accumulated in Zone 1, was secreted into the sinusoids and taken up again by downstream cells. The finally higher rhodamine B concentration in Zone 3 was caused by a zonal heterogeneity in intracellular sequestration and sinusoidal secretion of rhodamine B.\r"

One potent mediator of neutrophil chemotaxis is the complement-derived neutrophil chemoattractant, C5a, which can be inhibited by a serum protein, chemotactic factor inactivator. We hypothesized that chemotactic factor inactivator elevation might, in part, explain the defective neutrophil chemotaxis seen in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. To test this hypothesis, sera were collected from 22 patients with alcoholic hepatitis and 9 normal controls, and evaluated for the antigenic presence of chemotactic factor inactivator using an ELISA test. Chemotactic factor inactivator levels were found to be markedly elevated in patients with alcoholic hepatitis (162 +/- 24 micrograms per ml) compared to normals (60 +/- 3 micrograms per ml, p less than 0.01). Subdividing the hepatitis patients revealed that the elevation of chemotactic factor inactivator was found to be greatest in those patients with mild alcoholic hepatitis (prothrombin time within normal limits and bilirubin less than or equal to 5 mg per dl, 256 +/- 44 micrograms per ml, p less than 0.001), while the group with the severest hepatic dysfunction (prolonged prothrombin time and bilirubin greater than 5 mg per dl) did not differ significantly from controls (71 +/- 11 micrograms/ml, p less than 0.2). Importantly, the inhibition of C5a-induced chemotactic activity by partially purified chemotactic factor inactivator correlated with antigenic amounts of chemotactic factor inactivator in serum (r = 0.63, p less than 0.05). The C5a inhibitory activity in sera obtained from patients with alcoholic hepatitis coprecipitated with chemotactic factor inactivator when serum was precipitated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (45 to 64% saturation).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In control sera, bile salts distribute mainly between albumin and high-density lipoprotein. An amount of 19.7 +/- 3.6% (mean +/- S.D., n = 6) of the total serum bile salts was found in the high-density lipoprotein fraction of the density gradient. 2. In sera of nonicteric patients, the distribution pattern of [3H]taurocholate in the fractions of the density gradient showed no essential differences to normal serum. The relative amounts of taurocholate in the albumin-containing fractions and the high-density lipoprotein fractions were dependent on the concentrations of albumin and high-density lipoprotein. 3. In sera of deeply jaundiced patients, the distribution pattern of [3H]taurocholate showed two distinct peaks in the high-density lipoprotein density range, one of which codistributed with high-density lipoprotein2 and the other with a high-density fraction of high-density lipoprotein3 in the density range of 1.19 to 1.23 gm per ml. The distribution of [3H]taurocholate between albumin and high-density lipoprotein was markedly shifted toward high-density lipoprotein. No [3H]taurocholate association with lipoprotein X was observed. 4. Bilirubin was found to cause a shift of taurocholate from albumin to high-density lipoprotein in vitro. It is proposed that bilirubin is responsible, at least in part, for the observed shift in icteric sera.\r"

The prevalence of circulating polyalbumin antibodies was shown to be significantly increased over that of healthy controls (6.7%) in patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (67%), acute viral hepatitis (41%) and fulminant hepatic necrosis (38%), but such antibodies were absent in chronic hepatitis B patients and other liver diseases. Serial studies in acute hepatitis showed evidence of antibodies early in the course of illness with disappearance prior to full recovery. In acute hepatitis B, the presence of polyalbumin antibodies was significantly associated with female sex (p less than 0.01), 3-fold higher transaminase levels and shorter duration of clinical illness (less than 4 weeks in all cases). Polyalbumin antibodies appear to be associated with diseases characterized by active hepatocyte necrosis. Since they are evident early in acute hepatitis B when complexes of polyalbumin and virus are likely, these antibodies may play an adjunctive role to other hepatitis B-related antibodies in the clearance of hepatitis B virus infection.\r"

Only 1 (3.8%) biopsy and 9 (15%) postmortem livers were histologically normal. Macrosteatosis and nonspecific portal inflammation were the most common histologic abnormalities. Intrahepatic AIDS-specific opportunistic infections or malignancies were detected in 42% of both biopsy and autopsy groups, with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare the most frequent pathogen seen. Kaposi's sarcoma, although not detected on biopsy, was the most common postmortem AIDS-related hepatic finding. Intrahepatic lymphoma, cytomegalovirus hepatitis and hepatic mycoses were less frequently observed. In general, hepatic involvement represented part of a previously diagnosed, widely disseminated disease process, and liver biopsy led to new AIDS-specific diagnoses in only two patients. We conclude that while liver biopsy is a useful diagnostic tool in selected patients with AIDS, the information provided by biopsy rarely influences therapy or leads to improved survival.\r"

WLC-3 cells possess morphological and biochemical features of differentiated hepatocytes, including glucose-6-phosphatase activity and albumin production. Histopathological analysis of the tumor which developed transitorily in nude mouse subcutis after inoculation of the cell line revealed glandular structures comprising cells of hepatocellular-like morphology. This is the first established woodchuck hepatocyte cell line free from woodchuck hepatitis virus and is therefore expected to be useful for studying the mode of gene expression and viral proliferation of woodchuck hepatitis virus and the mechanisms underlying woodchuck hepatitis virus-related hepatocarcinogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of calcium supplementation on blood pressure and its mechanisms were investigated in two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertensive rats. Two series of experiments were performed: one was begun just after renal artery constriction, the other after the onset of hypertension. Calcium supplementation significantly attenuated the development of hypertension (systolic blood pressure: 183 +/- 8 vs 130 +/- 2 mm Hg) and was found to abate existing renovascular hypertension (systolic blood pressure: from 183 +/- 8 to 151 +/- 4 mm Hg). Calcium treatment did not cause significant alterations in fluid intake, urine volume, or urinary sodium excretion in either study. However, increased plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration were suppressed to the basal levels at the end of 3 weeks of calcium treatment (14 +/- 3 vs 8 +/- 2 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr; 530 +/- 50 vs 380 +/- 40 pg/ml). Blood pressure of calcium-treated renovascular hypertensive rats responded poorly to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with captopril injection and angiotensin II analogue (saralasin) infusion. Further, in rats with chronic established renovascular hypertension, calcium treatment attenuated the enhanced pressor response to norepinephrine, but not to angiotensin II. These results suggest that the blood pressure-lowering actions of calcium supplementation are related primarily to suppression of renin secretion and secondarily to alteration of pressor response to norepinephrine in two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertensive rats.\r"

In acute hypertension, the permeability surface area product for sucrose was increased at the blood-retinal barrier and at the blood-brain barrier over control values (p less than 0.02), and the vessels became leaky to microperoxidase. In chronic hypertension, the permeability of the blood-retinal barrier to sucrose was increased over that in control animals (p less than 0.02), whereas the permeability of the blood-brain barrier was unaffected. Neither barrier leaked microperoxidase. These results indicate that the blood-brain barrier and the blood-retinal barrier are similarly affected in acute hypertension and that in chronic hypertension, the blood-brain barrier is unaffected whereas the blood-retinal barrier is rendered more permeable to small, but not large, solutes.\r"

Two isolated heart preparations, an aortic-ejecting heart and an isovolumically contracting preparation with and without isoproterenol (10(-7)M) added, were employed. Under a constant perfusion pressure of 110 mm Hg, the heart rate, developed wall stress, and peak rate of change of pressure were not different between the two groups, but coronary flow and myocardial oxygen consumption were significantly lower in the SHR. Systolic values of myocardial high energy phosphate compounds (adenosine 5'-triphosphate, phosphocreatine) and myocardial lactate in the two preparations were not significantly different between SHR and WKY. Following adenosine infusion at maximum developed pressure (isovolumic preparation), both SHR and WKY demonstrated preservation of coronary reserve. These results indicate that cardiac hypertrophy represents a compensatory adaptation with improved mechanical efficiency in the 6-month-old SHR when maximally stressed and may be related to the shift from V1 to V2 and V3 isomyosin phenotypes that was observed in the hypertensive animals.\r"

  ".W": "Arginine vasopressin, a potent vasoconstrictor, does not raise arterial pressure in normal humans even at pathophysiological plasma levels. To examine whether the pressor effect of vasopressin in humans is buffered by baroreceptor reflex inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity, we recorded postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve activity directly from the peroneal nerve in 12 normal men before, during, and after a 20-minute intravenous infusion of vasopressin, 4 ng/kg/min, that increased mean plasma concentrations from 6.2 +/- 0.6 to 320 +/- 68 (SE) pg/ml. During the first 5 minutes (n = 8), mean arterial pressure increased from 91 +/- 3 to 97 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and integrated sympathetic nerve activity decreased from 271 +/- 45 to 156 +/- 33 units (p less than 0.05). At 15 minutes (n = 12), arterial pressure did not differ from control values whereas forearm vascular resistance fell (p less than 0.05) and central venous pressure and heart rate increased (p less than 0.05). Sympathetic nerve activity remained below control levels throughout the infusion (202 +/- 31 vs 254 +/- 40 units before infusion; p less than 0.05). An effect of vasopressin on ganglionic transmission was excluded, since the sympathoexcitatory response to apnea was not attenuated during vasopressin. Thus, pathophysiologic levels of vasopressin in humans cause inhibition of muscle sympathetic nerve activity that is not due to a ganglionic blocking action. The sympathoinhibition may be caused in part by the modest increases in mean arterial and central venous pressures and attendant stimulation of arterial and cardiac baroreceptors. The reflex decrease in sympathetic nerve activity would be expected to buffer the direct vasoconstrictor effects of vasopressin.\r"

  ".U": "88006367\r", 
  ".W": "Studies generally indicate that excretion of sodium, potassium, and water is greater during the day than during the night. To determine whether hypertensive patients exhibit this same pattern of excretion, diurnal variations in excretion of sodium, potassium, creatinine, and water were examined in 107 hypertensive men and women from a clinical trial on control of hypertension by nonpharmacological means--the Hypertension Control Program. Each participant provided two carefully timed 24-hour urine collections divided into daytime and overnight specimens. The median ratios of 24-hour to 8-hour overnight excretion were 2.84, 3.95, 2.99, and 2.77 for sodium, potassium, creatinine, and water, respectively. Thus, more than half of this hypertensive group exhibited a greater rate of sodium and water excretion during sleep than during daytime hours, a reversal of the usual pattern. When the group was subdivided based on age, sex, race, trial randomization group, use of diuretics, and hypertension severity, women had significantly lower ratios of 24-hour to overnight excretion for sodium and water than men and blacks had significantly lower 24-hour to overnight ratios for water and potassium than whites. When the 24-hour to overnight ratios for these hypertensive patients were compared with those for a group of 30 men and women with high-normal blood pressure, those with high-normal blood pressure had significantly larger ratios for sodium and water excretion than the hypertensive group. The results of this study suggest that hypertensive patients may have a different diurnal pattern of sodium and water excretion than normotensive subjects and that further research is needed to clarify this issue.\r"

  ".W": "To confirm reports of increased absenteeism after worksite hypertension screening, we performed a three-stage blood pressure screening among 5888 self-selected heterogeneous workers at 11 electronics plants using standardized screening and labeling procedures. A total of 296 subjects with mean systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or greater or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater on all three occasions were considered to have sustained hypertension. From the untreated normotensive subjects matched for eight sociodemographic and occupational variables, we prospectively selected one to three controls for each sustained hypertensive subject. Uncorrected absenteeism rates for sustained hypertensive subjects increased 22% from baseline in the postscreening year. Correction by logarithmic transformation for skewed distributions and by rates for matched controls for temporal trends reduced these changes to statistical insignificance with high statistical power. Several subgroups exhibited trends to increased absenteeism. At 12-month follow-up, the blood pressure of the sustained hypertensive subjects showed mean decreases of 12.6/6.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001) after the majority had received pharmacological antihypertensive treatment. These results suggest that worksite hypertension screening and labeling produce insignificant absenteeism change overall among self-selected heterogeneous work force populations.\r"

This was preceded by collection of five baseline measurements of blood pressure and urinary electrolyte excretion and followed by a 4-week recovery period. Although there was a significant increase in urinary potassium excretion during supplementation in both adults and children (p less than 0.001), there were no significant changes in systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial blood pressure. Height and weight increased significantly in children (p less than 0.001), and weight increased in adults (p less than 0.01) over the course of the study. Multivariate analysis of variance of blood pressure controlling for these confounding variables failed to reveal any effect of the potassium supplementation on blood pressure. These results suggest that increasing intake of dietary potassium alone in a healthy, free-living normotensive population is unlikely to have a discernible effect on blood pressure.\r"

Genetic markers were also examined. Both hypertensive and normotensive subjects with haptoglobin 1-1 phenotype were significantly more (p less than 0.05) likely to be sodium-sensitive than were those with 2-1 or 2-2 phenotypes, and subjects with 2-2 phenotypes were more apt to be sodium-resistant. A second population was examined in which both adults and children with haptoglobin 1-1 phenotype were found to have significantly (p less than 0.05) higher casual systolic and diastolic blood pressures. These two studies independently confirm a relationship between haptoglobin phenotypes and blood pressure and suggest an environmental factor (sodium) as well.\r"

The incidence of pregnancy hypertension increased with lead level. Multivariate models of pregnancy hypertension and systolic blood pressure as a function of maternal age, parity, hematocrit, ponderal index, race, and diabetes were improved by including lead as a predictor variable. At these observed levels of exposure (mean blood lead, 6.9 +/- 3.3 [SD] micrograms/dl), lead appears to have a small but demonstrable association with pregnancy hypertension and blood pressure at the time of delivery, but not with preeclampsia.\r"

Since the psychologic tests did not demonstrate marked changes in anxiety or affective mood states, and the former was only weakly related to the endocrine responses, psychologic stimuli cannot be ascribed a prominent role in causing the observed endocrine alterations. Thus, the data suggest that physiologic stressors, such as surgical trauma and the irritation of the tissue surrounding the pacemaker, were the primary stimuli that activated the HPA and SAM systems. Although the structured teaching program resulted in a marked improvement of the treatment groups's knowledge of the device and the follow-up care it requires, it did not affect the endocrine or psychologic responses of patients to cardiac pacemaker implantation.\r"

Exposure to 95% O2 for 5 days resulted in a 71% inhibition of [3H]phenylalanine incorporation into total proteins. When compared with control cells, we observed no changes in 1) the pool size of free cytoplasmic phenylalanine and of phenylalanine attached to transfer RNA (tRNA), 2) the rate of protein degradation, and 3) the rate of charging of tRNA with phenylalanine. We found that under hyperoxic conditions 1) the incorporation of [3H]-uridine into total and polyadenylated RNA was increased, 2) the efficiency of extracted messenger RNA to direct protein synthesis in a reticulocyte lysate was maintained, 3) the proportion of polymeric to monomeric ribosomes was slightly increased, and 4) the rate of elongation, as measured by the ribosomal transit time, was decreased. Thus the reduction in protein synthesis in hyperoxic cells appears to result primarily from defects at the translational level in polypeptide chain elongation.\r"

In this study we used sonomicrometry to examine the velocity of shortening and lengthening and the amount of shortening in the fresh and fatigued canine hemidiaphragm (8 dogs) including the force generated. Fatigue was produced by epiphrenic stimulation of the left phrenic nerve; the right hemidiaphragm acted as the control. We found that 1) hemidiaphragmatic fatigue caused an increase in frequency with reduced tidal volume; 2) fatigue resulted in a near complete cessation of tidal shortening during spontaneous breathing; 3) there was an initial decrease in central activation (electromyogram) to the fatigued hemidiaphragm, an indication of central fatigue; 4) force-frequency curves showed a considerable and prolonged loss of the amount of shortening, velocity, and force generated by the fatigued hemidiaphragm during supramaximal stimulation, an indication of peripheral fatigue; and 5) during spontaneous breathing in the fatigued hemidiaphragm, tidal shortening remained reduced for up to 3 h, whereas in the right right hemidiaphragm tidal shortening and electromyographic activity did not change. We conclude that fatigue of a hemidiaphragm alters the spontaneous breathing pattern and produces profound modifications in its contractile properties without altering contralateral hemidiaphragmatic performance.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation, important in perfusing potentially ischemic regions distal to pulmonary vascular obstructions, depends on driving pressure between an upstream site in intrathoracic systemic arterial network and pulmonary vascular bed. The reported increase of pulmonary infarctions in heart failure may be due to a reduction of this driving pressure. We measured upstream element for driving pressure for systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation by raising pulmonary venous pressure (Ppv) until the systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation ceased. We assumed that this was the same as upstream pressure when there was flow. Systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation was measured in left lower lobes (LLL) of 21 anesthetized open-chest dogs from volume of blood that overflowed from pump-perfused (90-110 ml/min) pulmonary vascular circuit of LLL and was corrected by any changes of LLL fluid volume (wt). Systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation upstream pressure was linearly related to systemic arterial pressure (slope = 0.24, R = 0.845). Increasing Ppv caused a progressive reduction of systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation, which stopped when Ppv was 44 +/- 6 cmH2O and pulmonary arterial pressure was 46 +/- 7 cmH2O. A further increase in Ppv reversed systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation with blood flowing back into the dog. When net systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation by the overflow and weight change technique was zero a small bidirectional flow (3.7 +/- 2.9 ml.min-1 X 100 g dry lobe wt-1) was detected by dispersion of tagged red blood cells that had been injected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Doses of beta-estradiol 3-benzoate (0.02, 0.04, 0.1, 0.2, 1, 2, 4, or 10 micrograms.0.1 ml of sunflower oil-1.100 g body wt-1) were injected 5 days/wk for 4 wk. Controls were sham injected (SI). After treatment, the animals were run to exhaustion on a motorized treadmill. ER animals receiving the 0.02-microgram dose ran significantly longer and completed more total work than the SI group. ER animals receiving doses of greater than or equal to 0.04 microgram ran longer and performed more work than the 0.02-microgram group. At exhaustion, myocardial glycogen content was significantly decreased in animals that were ER with less than or equal to 0.1 microgram, whereas those replaced with doses greater than 0.1 microgram utilized significantly less glycogen. With the 10-micrograms dose no significant decrease in heart glycogen content was observed at exhaustion. A submaximal 2-h run significantly reduced glycogen content in heart, red and white portions of the vastus lateralis, and the livers of SI animals. The latter effect was attenuated in skeletal muscle and liver, and there was no effect in the hearts of the ER animals receiving 2 micrograms. These data indicate that estradiol replacement in oophorectomized rats influenced myocardial glycogen utilization during exhaustive exercise and spared tissue glycogen during submaximal exercise. These glycogen sparing effects may have contributed to the significant improvements in exercise performance observed in this study.\r"

Responses obtained to each agonist after precontraction were greater than responses to the agonist alone after subtraction of the force due to the precontracting stimulus. Augmentation of responses after precontraction was the greatest for norepinephrine, less for 5-hydroxytryptamine, and least for acetylcholine. Verapamil had no significant effect on the augmentation of responses to either 5-hydroxytryptamine or acetylcholine caused by precontraction. When the efficacy of acetylcholine was decreased by receptor alkylation with phenoxybenzamine, the augmentation of responses to acetylcholine caused by precontraction with histamine was significantly enhanced. Differences in the magnitude of the effect of precontraction on responses to different agonists may reflect differences in their efficiency of stimulus-response coupling in canine tracheal smooth muscle, or they may result from an increased expression of distinct receptors or receptor-mediated effects uncovered by the facilitory stimuli.\r"

Eight male athletic volunteers were decompressed in a hypobaric chamber for 40 days to a barometric pressure (PB) of 240 Torr, equivalent to the summit of Mt. Everest. Serial hemodynamic measurements were made at PB 760 (sea level), 347 (6,100 m), and 282/240 Torr (7,620/8,840 m). Resting PAP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) increased from sea level to maximal values at PB 282 Torr from 15 +/- 0.9 to 34 +/- 3.0 mmHg and from 1.2 +/- 0.1 to 4.3 +/- 0.3 mmHg.l-1 X min, respectively. During near maximal exercise PAP increased from 33 +/- 1 mmHg at sea level to 54 +/- 2 mmHg at PB 282 Torr. Right atrial and wedge pressures were not increased with altitude. Acute 100% O2 breathing lowered cardiac output and PAP but not PVR. Systemic arterial pressure and resistance did not rise with altitude but did increase with O2 breathing, indicating systemic control differed from the lung circulation. We concluded that severe chronic hypoxia caused elevated pulmonary resistance not accompanied by right heart failure nor immediately reversed by O2 breathing.\r"

  ".W": "Hypoxia at high altitude could depress cardiac function and decrease exercise capacity. If so, impaired cardiac function should occur with the extreme, chronic hypoxemia of the 40-day simulated climb of Mt. Everest (8,840 m, barometric pressure of 240 Torr, inspiratory O2 pressure of 43 Torr). In the five of eight subjects having resting and exercise measurements at the barometric pressures of 760 Torr (sea level), 347 Torr (6,100 m), 282 Torr (7,620 m), and 240 Torr, heart rate for a given O2 uptake was higher with more severe hypoxia. Slight (6 beats/min) slowing of the heart rate occurred only during exercise at the lowest barometric pressure when arterial blood O2 saturations were less than 50%. O2 breathing reversed hypoxemia but never increased heart rate, suggesting that hypoxic depression of rate, if present, was slight. For a given O2 uptake, cardiac output was maintained. The decrease in stroke volume appeared to reflect decreased ventricular filling (i.e., decreased right atrial and wedge pressures). O2 breathing did not increase stroke volume for a given filling pressure. We concluded that extreme, chronic hypoxemia caused little or no impairment of cardiac rate and pump functions.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of halothane anesthesia have been investigated in intact and in decerebrated cats. Pulmonary ventilation and breathing pattern were studied during room-air breathing, hypercapnia, and O2 inhalation. The following results have been demonstrated. First, halothane anesthesia does not modify pulmonary ventilation, but a tachypnea much more intense in intact than in decerebrated cats is observed. This indicates that halothane-induced tachypnea originates mainly in structures rostral to the brain stem. Second, decerebrated animals exhibit a breathing pattern and a ventilatory response to CO2 similar to those of intact conscious cats, suggesting that forebrain facilitatory and inhibitory influences on brain stem are cancelled out by decerebration. However, the tidal volume vs. inspiratory duration relationship observed in decerebrated cats differs from that in conscious cats. Finally, during halothane anesthesia, ventilatory response to CO2 is markedly depressed. Third, during O2 inhalation, except in decerebrated, anesthetized animals, ventilation is only slightly depressed. This suggests that central stimulatory effect of O2 is enhanced and/or that peripheral chemoreceptor drive is reduced.\r"

At rest the median stroke volume was reduced by 21% during autonomic blockade (P less than 0.01), but cardiac output was maintained by a concomitant increase in heart rate. The systolic blood pressure was reduced from 120 to 105 mmHg (P less than 0.01), and left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced from 61 to 56% (P less than 0.05). After autonomic blockade the heart rate reached during exercise was the same. Stroke volume and cardiac output were maintained through cardiac dilation. The increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume was 31 vs. 10% during control conditions (P less than 0.01). The systolic blood pressure was reduced from 174 to 135 mmHg (P less than 0.01). Left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced from 75 to 67% (P less than 0.05), but the increase from rest to exercise was preserved. Total peripheral resistance was reduced by 17% (P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that the heart possesses intrinsic mechanisms to maintain cardiac output during submaximal upright exercise. End-diastolic dilation results in a preserved stroke volume despite a reduced contractility.\r"

Maximal O2 uptake was 19% lower after 5 wk suspension. Loss of muscle mass was greater in SOL (63%) than in EDL (22%) muscle. A reduction of type I distribution was accompanied by an increase of intermediate fiber subgroups (int I in SOL, int II in EDL). The cross-sectional area of all three fiber types was reduced by hypokinesia. The decrease in capillaries per fiber in SOL was greater than the decrease in citrate synthase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities after 5 wk. No alteration in lactate dehydrogenase activity was noted. In EDL, no changes in fiber area, capillarization, and enzymatic activities occurred. Energy charge remained unchanged (0.91) whatever the muscle. These results suggest that type I fibers showed an earlier and greater susceptibility than type II fibers to suspension which is also accompanied by a decreased aerobic capacity.\r"

In six subjects the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the working muscle was recorded. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis before, immediately after, and 1 min after exercise. Tissue specimens were subsequently assayed for various muscle metabolites. Peak torque, as an average of the 60 knee extensions, was higher (P less than 0.05) at 1.3 ATA than at 6 or 1 ATA. Peak torque of the exercising muscle declined more rapidly at 1 ATA than at 1.3 ATA, differing in the final 24 contractions by 14%. At 6 ATA peak torque of the initial 12 contractions was 6% lower (P less than 0.05) than at 1 ATA but equaled 1-ATA values in the latter third of the exercise bout. Although the EMG activity at 1 ATA increased relative to that at 6 ATA as exercise proceeded, the rate of force decline was greater at 1 ATA. Despite greater total work produced at 1.3 ATA than at 1 ATA, the metabolic response to exercise was not substantially altered at increased O2 pressure. However, the restitution rate of energy-rich phosphagens and the elimination of lactate during recovery were greater (P less than 0.05) at 1.3 ATA. These results suggest that hyperoxia may enhance the rate of energy release, whereas high N2 pressure and/or high hydrostatic pressure seem to interfere with neuromuscular activity.\r"

Experiments were carried out at 26 degrees C and after exposure to 40 degrees C and 40% relative humidity for 105 min. Continuous measurements of esophageal (Tes) and mean skin (Tsk) temperatures and heart rate (HR) were recorded. Other variables studied included blood pressure (BP), forearm blood flow (FBF), and cardiac output (CO), which were measured at 4- to 5-min intervals. Measurements were made in the supine position and after 70 degrees head-up tilt for 15 min. Cardioacceleration during the tilt test was greater in the young men than in the old. Other cardiovascular responses of the old men to orthostatism were qualitatively similar to that of the young except for FBF and forearm vascular conductance. The old men did not show significant changes in FBF during tilting, suggesting a deterioration in the sympathetic nervous reflex in the aged. However, other circulatory adaptations seemed to overcome this deficiency resulting in orthostatic tolerance similar to that of the young. During head-up tilt at 26 and 40 degrees C, Tes of both age groups increased. This may reflect a decrease in conductive heat transfer presumably due to diminished blood flow to the periphery.\r"

In vitro studies using isolated vascular strips demonstrated that pulmonary arterial smooth muscle contracted to leukotriene C4 (LTC4), whereas pulmonary vein smooth muscle did not. Pulmonary arterial contraction was due to both the direct action of LTC4 and secondarily generated thromboxane A2 (TxA2). In vivo, LTC4 injection caused a pronounced but transient increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (Ppw), with a smaller effect on left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Effects of LTD4 were smaller with comparable pressure changes at all three sites, suggesting a primary cardiac effect. Like LTC4, histamine caused a disproportionate increase in Ppw vs. left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. These observations suggest that LTC4 causes pulmonary venoconstriction in vivo despite its lack of effect on pulmonary vein smooth muscle in vitro. This discrepancy may be due to venoconstrictor effects of TxA2 generated from upstream pulmonary arterial vessels.\r"

Each subject (n = 7) served as his own control and was tested on a weekly schedule. Under control treatment, rectal temperature (Tre) decreased by 0.9 degrees C to approximately 36.2 degrees C after cold exposure, whereas under theophylline and Ensure, the decrease of Tre was only 0.4 degrees C, indicating a significant increase (P less than 0.05) in cold resistance (50% better than control). The plasma concentration of theophylline was 4.8-5.9 micrograms/ml and was positively correlated with plasma concentration of free fatty acids. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) increased significantly during cold exposure; the absolute concentration was significantly higher after theophylline pretreatment. The plasma concentrations of glucose, epinephrine, cortisol, and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate did not change and the changes of free thyroxine and triiodothyronine were minor. Together, the effectiveness of theophylline + Ensure in acutely increasing cold resistance may be due to increased substrate availability for thermogenesis, part of which, through theophylline's potentiation of both sympathetic release of NE and NE-stimulated lipolysis and part of which, through supplementary feeding of Ensure.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of several different animal models to O2-induced lung injury has revealed marked differences in sensitivity of various species to O2 damage. These differences may be due in part to variation of cellular antioxidant defenses. To characterize lung antioxidant enzyme activities in different species, we measured lung activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione S-transferase (GSH S-trans) in rat, hamster, baboon, and human lung. Soluble lung fractions were also fractionated on Sephadex G-150-S columns and GSH-Px activity was measured using both cumene hydroperoxide and H2O2. This was done to evaluate non-Se-dependent GSH-Px activity in these lung samples. Human lung was obtained at surgery from patients undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy for localized lung tumors. SOD activity was similar for all four groups. GSH-Px activity was higher in rat lung than baboon or hamster lung. Lung CAT activity was variable with the highest activity present in the baboon which revealed a lung CAT activity 10 times higher than activity present in the rat. Lung GSH S-trans activities were higher in hamster, baboon, and human lung than in rat lung. Non-Se-dependent GSH-Px was present in rat lung but absent in hamster, baboon, and human lung. We conclude that the hamster was the best model of the animals studied for mimicking human lung antioxidant enzyme activities. Rat lung antioxidant enzyme activities were markedly different from any of the other species examined.\r"

Ventilation variables, chest wall, and upper airway inspiratory muscle electromyograms (EMG), and upper airway resistance were measured for two breaths immediately preceding and immediately following six applications of an inspiratory resistive load of 15 cmH2O.l-1 X s during wakefulness and stage 2 sleep. During wakefulness, chest wall inspiratory peak EMG activity increased 40 +/- 15% (SE), and inspiratory time increased 20 +/- 5%. Therefore, the rate of rise of chest wall EMG increased 14 +/- 10.9% (NS). Upper airway inspiratory muscle activity changed in an inconsistent fashion with application of the load. Tidal volume decreased 16 +/- 6%, and upper airway resistance increased 141 +/- 23% above pre-load levels. During sleep, there was no significant chest wall or upper airway inspiratory muscle or timing responses to loading. Tidal volume decreased 40 +/- 7% and upper airway resistance increased 188 +/- 52%, changes greater than those observed during wakefulness. We conclude that 1) the immediate inspiratory muscle and timing responses observed during inspiratory resistive loading in wakefulness were absent during sleep, 2) there was inadequate activation of upper airway inspiratory muscle activity to compensate for the increased upper airway inspiratory subatmospheric pressure present during loading, and 3) the alteration in upper airway mechanics during resistive loading was greater during sleep than wakefulness.\r"

At the earliest gestational age, diaphragmatic EMG activity was mainly tonic and associated with tonic activity of somatic muscles. The stimulus for the diaphragmatic activity originated centrally. Brief periods of a rapid-eye-movement (REM) state characterized by phasic lateral rectus and diaphragmatic activity and absence of nuchal activity were recognized. Furthermore, from 0.5 to 0.7 gestation onward, activity of all muscles increased. Thereafter increased specificity of activity in relation to the apparent REM and non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) state occurred. With maturation, phasic diaphragmatic activity increased at the expense of tonic activity. The most striking effect of maturation on apnea was a greater proportion of apnea lasting greater than 1 min, but the total duration of apnea as a percent of a total recording remained unchanged. The quantitative response to hypercapnia during maturation was independent of the pattern of spontaneous diaphragmatic activity. Hypercapnia at 0.5 gestation changed the pattern of diaphragmatic EMG activity from mainly tonic to phasic. Thus the central chemoreceptors and appropriate neuronal pathways are present and functional as early as 0.5 gestation. Hypercapnia at 0.5 gestation caused a shift in diaphragmatic EMG power to lower frequencies similar to that found during control conditions in the older fetus. This might suggest that during maturation there is increased recruitment of phrenic motoneurons. Hypoxemia abolished tonic somatic activity at 0.5 gestation and decreased phasic diaphragmatic activity at more advanced gestational ages. Therefore the central inhibitory mechanisms of hypoxemia are developed by 0.5 gestation.\r"

We studied the effect of postoperative bacteremia on lung protein clearance in relation to plasma fibronectin levels using the unanesthetized sheep lung lymph fistula model and the effect of infusion of purified human plasma fibronectin on lung protein clearance. Sheep received live Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 X 10(8) iv) at a time of normal plasma fibronectin (590 +/- 37 micrograms/ml) or 5 days later at a time corresponding to elevation of plasma fibronectin (921 +/- 114 micrograms/ml). After the first bacterial challenge, there was a 22% decrease (P less than 0.05) in plasma fibronectin. Lung lymph flow (QL) initially increased 308% (P less than 0.05) by 2 h (0 h = 4.7 +/- 1.1 ml/h; 2 h = 14.4 +/- 3.5 ml/h), and the total protein lymph-to-plasma concentration ratio (L/P) declined. This was followed by a sustained second phase response over 3-12 h which was characterized by a 202-393% elevation in QL (P less than 0.05), an increase in the L/P ratio, and a 240-480% (P less than 0.05) increase in lung transvascular protein clearance (TVPC = QL X L/P). Sheep with elevated fibronectin levels also manifested the early (2 h) elevation in QL (P less than 0.05) coupled with a decline in L/P ratio after the second bacterial challenge, but the second-phase increase in TVPC was markedly attenuated. Intravenous infusion of 500 mg of human plasma fibronectin into normal sheep to elevate the fibronectin level comparable to that in the hyperfibronectinemic sheep also attenuated (P less than 0.05) the second-phase (3-12 h) increase in lung protein clearance with sepsis. Thus elevation of plasma fibronectin during postoperative Gram-negative bacteremia may protect the lung vascular barrier. This response may be mediated by either fibronectin's opsonic support of phagocytic function or its influence on lung endothelial cell adhesion.\r"

Edema was produced in continually weighed, excised rabbit lungs kept in zone 1 (alveolar pressure = 25 cmH2O) by increasing pulmonary arterial (Ppa) and/or venous (Ppv) pressure from 5 to 20 cmH2O (relative to the lung base) and continuing this hydrostatic stress for 3-5 h. Raising Ppa and Ppv simultaneously produced a lower filtration rate than the sum of the filtration rates obtained when Ppa and Ppv were raised separately, while the lung gained from 20 to 95% of its initial weight. When vascular pressure was elevated in either EAV segment, fluid filtration always decreased rapidly as the lung gained up to 30-45% of its initial weight. Filtration then decreased more slowly. The lungs became isogravimetric at 60 and 85% weight gain when the Ppa or Ppv was elevated, respectively; when Ppa and Ppv were raised simultaneously substantial fluid filtration continued even after 140% weight gain. We conclude that the arterial and venous EAV's share a common interstitium in the zone 1 condition, this interstitium cannot be represented as a single compartment with a fixed resistance and compliance, and arterial and venous EAV leakage influences leakage from the other segment.\r"

The amplitude of the H and M responses were determined from the computerized full-wave rectified and integrated surface electromyographic (EMG) signal derived from bipolar surface electrodes placed over the soleus muscle. Hypoxic exposure [end-tidal O2 fraction (FETO2) = 0.066 +/- 0.003 and end-tidal CO2 fraction (FETCO2) = 0.0504 +/- 0.001 (SE)] did not affect the maximal M (Mmax) response but decreased significantly (7%) the maximal H (Hmax) response. The Hmax/Mmax ratio decreased from 0.60 to 0.53. Furthermore, by fitting the rising phase of the recruitment curves of the H and M responses vs. stimulus intensity with linear regressions, hypoxia was found to produce a significant decrease of similar magnitude (6%) in the threshold of both the H and M responses with no change in slope. Using a constant stimulus strength eliciting an H response of half the maximum (H50%) of the control conditions, hypoxia resulted in a 50% increase in the amplitude of the H response within 12 min. These results suggest that the effects of hypoxia on the nervous system consist of a direct depolarizing action on the peripheral alpha-fibers and 1A sensory fibers and of a central effect on supraspinal structures affecting the spinal alpha-motoneurons.\r"

SP (10(-12) to 10(-4) M) produced dose-dependent increases in the contractile response, and the maximal tension induced by SP was approximately 70% of the response to methacholine. SP-induced contraction is blocked completely by atropine and augmented by neostigmine. Pretreatment with hemicholinium 3, an acetylcholine synthesis inhibitor, inhibited the contractile response to SP. Pretreatment with tetrodotoxin did not inhibit the contractile response to SP. Capsaicin induced tension of a magnitude similar to that of SP. SP (10(-7) M) produced a significant increase (74% above control) in radiolabeled glycoconjugate release from isolated glands, whereas SP had no significant effects on glycoconjugate release from tracheal explants, probably because of epithelial suppression. Atropine abolished SP-evoked glycoconjugate release in isolated glands. Our findings indicate that 1) SP induces glandular contraction, which is related to the squeezing of mucus in the ducts and secretory tubules, 2) SP stimulates radiolabeled glycoconjugate release in isolated submucosal gland, probably involving mucus synthesis and/or cellular secretion, and 3) these two actions are mediated by a peripheral cholinergic mechanism.\r"

This study examined the relationship between exercise intensity and circulating levels of sulfoconjugated norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. Seven exercise-trained men biked at approximately 30, 60, and 90% of their individual maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) for 8 min. The 90% VO2max period resulted in significantly increased plasma free norepinephrine (rest, 219 +/- 85; exercise, 2,738 +/- 1,149 pg/ml; P less than or equal to 0.01) and epinephrine (rest, 49 +/- 49; exercise, 555 +/- 516 pg/ml; P less than or equal to 0.05). These changes were accompanied by consistent increases in sulfoconjugated norepinephrine at both the 60% (rest, 852 +/- 292; exercise, 1,431 +/- 639; P less than or equal to 0.05) and 90% (rest, 859 +/- 311; exercise, 2,223 +/- 1,015; P less than or equal to 0.05) VO2max periods. Plasma sulfoconjugated epinephrine and dopamine displayed erratic changes at the three exercise intensities.

Ice packs were applied to the skin of the face, chest, thigh, and upper arm in random sequence while serially measuring specific conductance. In this fashion a limited mapping of skin-mediated bronchoconstriction was established. Warm packs were applied to the same areas of control for any potential nonspecific stimulatory effects. Cooling the skin induced bronchoconstriction to a similar degree in both groups; this effect was very small, did not induce symptoms, and was only seen with stimulation of the face. At another time, the subjects performed isocapnic hyperventilation of frigid air to ascertain their response to direct airway cooling. A moderate but significant correlation existed between skin and airway sensitivity; however, the magnitude of the two responses differed markedly. Breathing cold air at rest had no effect on lung function; however, elevating ventilation promptly produced bronchial narrowing. Hence, in a cold environment, the most potent stimulus for the development of airway obstruction in asthmatics derives from a direct airway effect.\r"

Mean BHD in children (16.1 s) was only 37.4% (P less than 0.001) of adult BHD (43.0 s). Within children, BHD was significantly (P less than 0.001) dependent on age (A in yr) according to the regression BHD = -1.46 + 2.27A. No age dependency of BHD occurred in adults. Due to the low BHD of children, only 14/87 (16.1%) were able to breath hold for the 25 s necessary to develop full diving bradycardia. For these 14 children, their bradycardia (36.1% reduction) was insignificantly different (P greater than 0.50) from that of adults (36.4%). These experimental findings demonstrate that the dive response of children is extremely weak, due mainly to their very low BHD. Since lower water temperature would probably accentuate the shortness of BHD (according to previous findings for adults), it is concluded that the dive response is unlikely to make a significant contribution to the prolonged resuscitatibility of children who are victims of cold-water near-drowning.\r"

Hypoxic exposure of two different durations were used: a short-term exposure (2-3 h) was used to measure the response of the same carotid chemoreceptors; and a long-term exposure (28 days at inspired PO2 of 70 Torr) to study carotid chemoreceptor properties in one group of cats relative to those of a control group. In the chronically hypoxic and control groups, determinations were made of the 1) steady-state responses to four levels of arterial PO2 (PaO2) at constant levels of arterial PCO2; 2) steady-state responses to acute hypercapnia during hyperoxia; and 3) maximal discharge rates during anoxia. We found that the acute responses of carotid chemoreceptor afferents to a given level of hypoxia (PaO2 = 30-40 Torr) did not significantly change within 2-3 h. After long-term exposure the carotid chemoreceptor responses to hypoxia significantly increased, with no significant changes in the hypercapnic response and in the maximal discharge rate during anoxia. We conclude that isocapnic hypoxia may not elicit a sufficient cellular response within 2-3 h in the cat carotid body to sensitize the O2 responsive mechanism, but hypoxia of longer duration will sensitize such a mechanism, thereby augmenting the chemosensory activity.\r"

SAP-35 inhibited [3H]PC secretion in a dose-dependent manner and significantly inhibited basal, phorbol ester, beta-adrenergic, and P2-purinergic agonist-induced [3H]PC secretion. SAP-35 significantly inhibited [3H]PC secretion from 1 to 3 h after treatment. The IC50 for inhibition of [3H]PC secretion by canine SAP-35 was 1-5 X 10(-6) g/ml and was similar for inhibition of both basal and secretagogue-stimulated release. Heat denaturation of SAP-35, addition of monoclonal anti-SAP-35 antibody, reduction and alkylation of SAP-35, or association of SAP-35 with phospholipid vesicles reversed the inhibitory effect on secretagogue-induced secretion. Inhibitory effects of SAP-35 were observed 3 h after cells were washed with buffer that did not contain SAP-35. Although SAP-35 enhanced reassociation of surfactant phospholipid with isolated type II cells, its inhibitory effect on secretion of [3H]PC did not result from stimulation of reuptake of secreted [3H]PC by type II cells. The inhibition of phospholipid secretion by SAP-35 was also not due to inhibition of PC or disaturated PC synthesis by SAP-35. SAP-35, the major phospholipid-associated protein in pulmonary surfactant, is a potent inhibitor of surfactant secretion from type II cells in vitro and may play an important role in homeostasis of surfactant in the alveolar space.\r"

Minute ventilation (VI) and ventral medullary surface pH (Vm pH) were measured in six anesthetized, peripherally chemodenervated cats. NLX consistently increased base-line hyperoxic VI from 618 +/- 99 to 729 +/- 126 ml/min (P less than 0.05). Although NLX did not alter the Vm pH response to CO [initial alkalosis, Vm pH +0.011 +/- 0.003 pH units, followed by acidosis, Vm pH -0.082 +/- 0.036 at carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) 55%], NLX attenuated the amount of ventilatory depression; increasing HbCO to 55% decreased VI to 66 +/- 6% of base line before NLX and to 81 +/- 9% of base line after NLX (P less than 0.05). The difference in response after NLX was primarily the result of a linear increase in tidal volume (VT) with decreasing Vm pH (delta VT = 60.3 ml/-pH unit) which was absent before NLX. To assess whether the site of action of the endogenous opioid effect was the central chemosensors, the ventilatory and Vm pH response to progressive HbCO was determined in three additional cats before and after topical application of NLX (3 X 10(-4) M) to the ventral medullary surface. The effect of topical NLX was similar to systemic NLX; significant attenuation of the reduction in VI with increasing HbCO. We conclude that 1) endogenous opioids mediate a portion of the depression of ventilation due to acute brain hypoxia, and 2) this effect is probably at the central chemosensitive regions.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of airway wall flexibility on the clearance of mucuslike gels. Transient airflows similar to cough were generated by both positive and negative pressure, the latter to mimic the dynamic compression that occurs during real cough. As in the previous study, the trachea was modeled as a trough of rectangular cross section with only the bottom lined with the mucus simulant. Clearance was followed by observing the displacement of marker particles. Since cough clearance is intimately related to wave formation in the mucus blanket, we hypothesized that clearance might be impeded if the wave formation occurred simultaneously in the wall and its lining layer. Thus, in one set of experiments the bottom rigid surface of the model trachea was replaced with a frame over which a flexible membrane could be drawn, whereas in the other set the rigid top was replaced by the frame. We also examined the effect of negative-pressure cough in excised canine tracheae, comparing the case where the tracheal membrane was free to deform vs. the case where it was secured. For the rigid-walled model, clearance by positive or negative pressure, with matched flow pattern, was the same. With the mucus simulant lining the flexible bottom surface, clearance increased with increasing membrane flexibility for negative-pressure cough and decreased for positive-pressure cough.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Five female Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with chronic bipolar electrodes in the plantaris muscle of the left hindlimb under pentobarbital anesthesia. Characteristics of EMG bursts recorded while the conscious rat was performing treadmill walking (0.24 m/s) were stable and reproducible 10-14 days postsurgery. Following this stabilization period, records of EMG activity were obtained during walking, loaded swimming (6.5 g attached to tail), and several other locomotor tasks. Compared to walking, EMG bursts during loaded swimming were significantly higher (67%) in maximum amplitude, one-third as long in duration, and occurred at a greater rate (4.4 vs. 1.7 bursts/s, P less than 0.05). Swimming bursts were of higher amplitudes than those of all other activities examined and reached 65% of the EMG amplitude recorded following stimulation of the sciatic nerve with supramaximal voltage. The addition of a mass to the animal's tail during swimming did not increase the EMG burst amplitudes but resulted in a higher frequency of bursts. Compared with treadmill walking, loaded swimming elicited burst of high variability in amplitude. Swimming in the rat involves rapid, extensive activation of plantaris, thus providing an exercise model to study the adaptability of the neuromuscular system to prolonged activity of this type.\r"

Data were recorded at the end of each stage. For many measured variables values during the descending phase of LBNP (-8 to -40 mmHg) were significantly different from values during the ascending phase of (-40 to -8 mmHg). These differences appear to be due to a component of fluid translocation that occurs during LBNP and cannot be reversed within the duration of the procedure. We hypothesize that this slowly reversed component is sequestration of fluid in the interstitial and lymphatic compartments. In contrast, venous pooling is a rapidly reversible component of fluid movement during LBNP. A scheme describing fluid and cardiovascular responses to LBNP based on these data and the data of other investigators is presented.\r"

Muscle O2 uptake, blood flow, O2 extraction, and developed tension were measured at rest and at 1 twitch/s isometric contractions in normoxia and in hypoxia. No differences were observed between the two groups at rest. During contractions and hypoxia, however, O2 uptake decreased from the normoxic level in the COH group but not in the HH group. Blood flow increased in both groups during hypoxia, but more so in the COH group. O2 extraction increased further with hypoxia (P less than 0.05) during concentrations in the HH group but actually fell (P less than 0.05) in the COH group. The O2 uptake limitation during COH and contractions was associated with a lesser O2 extraction. The leftward shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve during COH may have impeded tissue O2 extraction. Other factors, however, such as decreased myoglobin function or perfusion heterogeneity must have contributed to the inability to utilize the O2 reserve more fully.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether similar responses are produced by chemical activation of epicardial receptors in the right ventricle. Receptors were stimulated by applying either capsaicin (10 micrograms) or bradykinin (500 ng) to the epicardial surface of the right ventricle in anesthetized cats. Application of either chemical evoked an increase in respiratory output (phrenic nerve activity), a decrease in heart rate, and a nonsignificant increase in arterial pressure in intact cats. However, capsaicin and bradykinin produced significant increases in arterial pressure, heart rate, and respiratory output after bilateral cervical vagotomy. In contrast, a fall in both heart rate and arterial pressure with only small increases in respiratory output were evoked after bilateral removal of the stellate ganglia in cats with intact vagi. Only small responses to the chemical stimulation of right ventricular receptors persisted after combined vagotomy and stellate ganglionectomy. These findings suggest that 1) activation of epicardial receptors with sympathetic afferents originating in the right ventricle causes an increase in cardiorespiratory function, and 2) activation of right ventricular receptors with vagal afferents produces decreases in heart rate and arterial pressure.\r"

At all temperatures steady-state BP, Tco, and M were higher for SHR's than for WKY's. SHR's could maintain thermal balance up to Ta 32 degrees C, and WKY's up to 34 degrees C. Eres from SHR's was greater than from WKY's at Ta of 12.5, 17, and 28.5 degrees C. K of SHR's was not different from or was higher than K of WKY's, and K for both groups was 2.6 times greater at Ta 32 degrees C than at 17 degrees C. These results indicate that the high Tco of SHR's is due to increased M uncompensated by increased K or Eres.\r"

Extending the almitrine treatment for 15 days (one daily ip injection) produced a further progressive diminution in DA stores (-55%; P less than 0.01). The utilization rate of DA measured after inhibiting catecholamine biosynthesis by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine was strongly reduced by almitrine (-98% after 15 days; P less than 0.01). The effects of almitrine were dose dependent. The noradrenergic activity was much less altered by the drug.

Coagulation times, euglobulin lysis time, and fibrin(ogen) fragment E were normal in all groups without significant changes.

FPA was normal in one patient with HAPE, however. Severe AMS was accompanied by a significant decrease in arterial PO2 due to an increase in alveolar-arterial O2 difference, whereas arterial PCO2 did not change significantly.

Potassium depletion was induced by feeding the rats a K-deficient diet for 4 wk and injecting deoxycorticosterone acetate during the first week. After 4 wk, the rats were growth retarded and hypokalemic (1.9 mmol/l plasma) and had low whole-body and muscle K content, 188 +/- 27 and 276 +/- 19 mmol/kg fat-free dried tissue (FFDT), respectively, compared with 296 +/- 10 and 454 +/- 13 mmol/kg FFDT for the control group. Sodium and water retention also occurred in the K-deficient group. After K depletion, the rats were divided into four groups and received either 0, 1, 2, or 3 intragastric doses of 10 mmol KCl/kg at 8-h intervals. The rats were killed 8 h after the last dose. Control rats were treated similarly. K-depleted and control rats responded differently to K loading. In the normal rats, plasma K remained at 5.0 +/- 0.5 mmol/l, muscle K increased to 502 +/- 24 mmol/kg, and muscle K/N ratio increased from 3.0 to 3.4 mmol/g. In the K-depleted rats, plasma K increased to 7.2 +/- 0.7 mmol/l, muscle K increased to 453 +/- 50 mmol/kg, and muscle K/N ratio increased from 1.8 to 3.1 mmol/g. These data indicate that the capacity of the muscles to accumulate K was impaired after severe K depletion and caused elevated plasma K levels when repletion was complete.\r"

To accomplish this, quantitative three-dimensional reconstructions were made of small airways, the alveolar duct system, and alveoli. The branching pattern of the small airways immediately proximal to the alveolar ducts varied significantly. For example, the number of bronchiole-alveolar duct junctions per parent bronchus (terminal bronchiole) ranged from two to six. The number of bronchiole-alveolar duct junctions per lung was 7,280 +/- 250 (mean +/- SE). The general shape of the ventilatory unit arising from each bronchiole-alveolar junction was that of a space-filling sphere with an outer diameter of 1,490 +/- 130 microns. The average distance from the bronchiole-alveolar duct junction to alveoli at the end of the alveolar sac termination was 1,290 +/- 100 microns. Numerous trifurcations were found in the branching pattern of the alveolar ducts. The branching of the alveolar ducts did not fit a regular dichotomous pattern. The volume of the terminal branches (alveolar sacs) accounted for 64 +/- 5% of the volume of the ventilatory unit. Both of these factors, the pattern of branching and the substantial volume distributed in the most peripheral branches, contribute to the uniform distribution of gas within the ventilatory unit and thus minimize potential diffusion limitations to gas exchange.\r"

We implanted markers in the LV to establish three perpendicular axes and recorded the motion of these markers using biplane cinefluoroscopy at 60 Hz. The primary changes in LV size that accompanied inspiration occurred at end diastole (ED). The largest change in LVED dimension was a 2.46-mm narrowing of the septal-lateral wall dimension, but the apex-base dimension decreased also, by 0.74 mm. The anteroposterior dimension actually widened by 1.07 mm. The septal-lateral narrowing was caused by both a 1.0-mm narrowing of the distance between the septal marker and the apex-base axis, as well as by a 1.4-mm narrowing between the apex-base axis and the lateral wall marker. Narrowing of the septal portion seemed expected because of presumed enhanced right ventricular filling during inspiration. Narrowing of the lateral portion of the LV, while the anteroposterior dimension widened, was surprising because a change in LVEDV shape is implied. Assuming ventricular homogeneity, this change in LVED shape implies that the forces applied to the epicardial surface were not uniform. There must have been a retraction on the anterior and posterior surface that was not experienced by the lateral LV wall. The net effect of these dimensional changes of the LV at end diastole (estimated from the product of the three ED axes) was a 3.5-cm3 reduction in LVED volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During the experiment, the subject's ventilatory functions and respiratory gases were recorded continuously, and the resultant HbCO% was measured in venous blood samples by gas chromatography. Mean increase (+/- SD) in HbCO% per exposure was 2.08 +/- 0.27% for the 1,500 ppm CO exposures and 2.05 +/- 0.29% for the 7,500 ppm CO exposures with no significant difference between the two.

SAM flux began between 0.82 and 0.85 gestation in the females and between 0.85 and 0.89 gestation in the males and matured more rapidly thereafter in the females than in the males (P less than 0.01). beta-Adrenergic receptor binding, using [3H]dihydroalprenolol as the ligand, was saturable, linear, and stereospecific. The order of potency of competitive beta-agonists was isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than epinephrine. The maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of pulmonary beta-receptors approximately doubled between 0.84 and 0.89 gestation, coinciding with the onset of SAM flux. Bmax matured as a third degree polynomial function of gestational age in females (r = 0.9, P less than 0.001) but as a linear function in males (r = 0.8, P less than 0.005). Between 0.86 and 0.93 gestation, Bmax was 1.45-fold greater in females than males (P less than 0.001). The dissociation constant of beta-receptors was not influenced significantly by gender or gestation. We conclude that maturation of pulmonary beta-receptors coincides with the onset of SAM flux in fetal lambs and that both mature more rapidly in females. We speculate that pulmonary beta-receptor maturation and SAM flux are coregulated by hormonal factors. More rapid maturation of pulmonary beta-receptors and SAM flux in females may be a factor in the female advantage with regard to pulmonary surfactant maturation and the survival of premature neonates.\r"

  ".W": "In anesthetized cats reducing local arterial pressure from 125 to 75 Torr decreased blood flow (53 +/- 5%) and force production (57 +/- 7%) in soleus and medial gastrocnemius. Force was produced in these muscles by aerobic, slowly fatiguing fibers. Similar reductions in arterial pressure did not affect force production in caudofemoralis, which contains mainly fast-fatiguing fibers. In human subjects the electromyogram produced by the ankle extensors during rhythmic constant-force contractions increased as the contracting muscles were raised above the heart during legs-up tilt. This suggests that force production of active muscle fibers at a given level of activation fell with muscle perfusion pressure, thus requiring augmentation of muscle activity to sustain the standard contractions. Because aerobic fibers contributed to these contractions, it appears that force production of human muscle fibers is sensitive to small changes in perfusion pressure and, presumably, blood flow. The critical dependence of developed muscular force on blood pressure is of importance to motor control and may also play a significant role in cardiovascular control during exercise.\r"

We hypothesized that agents which could decrease intracellular concentrations of toxic metabolites of O2 would prevent endotoxin effects on cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells. We measured endotoxin-induced release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from and production of prostanoids by cultured bovine pulmonary endothelial cells in the presence and absence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol. Escherichia coli endotoxin (0.001-10 micrograms/ml) caused a dose-related release of LDH and stimulated production of both prostacyclin [measured as 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha)] and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Both DMSO and allopurinol decreased endotoxin-induced LDH release; this effect was related to concentration of the drugs (0-2% for DMSO and 0-0.3 mg/ml for allopurinol). Both drugs also prevented endotoxin-induced changes in endothelial morphology. Endotoxin increased intracellular reduction of the redox dye nitro blue tetrazolium, caused intracellular oxidation of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and caused release of conjugated dienes from endothelial cells; both DMSO and allopurinol inhibited those responses. DMSO, but not allopurinol, prevented endotoxin-induced production of prostacyclin and PGE2 by endothelium. Direct injury of pulmonary endothelium by endotoxin is inhibited by two chemically dissimilar drugs which have a common potential for decreasing intracellular concentrations of toxic metabolites of O2; indirect evidence suggests that potential as a mechanism for the protective effects of the drugs.\r"

We hypothesized that abnormalities on RC-Ab motion are primarily related to increased load rather than fatigue. We tested this hypothesis in subjects breathing against resistive loads while maintaining 30 and 60% of maximum mouth pressure (Pmmax). RC-Ab asynchrony and paradox and the degree of variation in compartmental contribution to tidal volume were measured by inductive plethysmography and quantitated by the Konno-Mead method of analysis. Comparing measurements of base line and 30 and 60% of Pmmax indicated that the degree of asynchrony, paradox, and variation in compartmental contribution were significantly related to the level of the load; significant abnormalities were observed at even 30% of Pmmax, a target pressure that can be sustained indefinitely. In another group of subjects, fatigue was induced by sustaining 60% of Pmmax to the limits of tolerance. Indexes of abnormal RC-Ab motion increased from base line during the 1st min of loaded breathing but displayed no progression from the beginning to the end of the fatigue run. Immediately on discontinuation of the load, the indexes returned to levels similar to base line despite persistence of the fatigue state. These results in healthy subjects breathing against severe resistances indicate that RC-Ab asynchrony and paradox and variation in compartmental contribution to tidal volume are predominantly due to increases in respiratory load rather than muscle fatigue.\r"

The resolution of the finer structure of this distribution is limited however. This study examines the theoretical basis of this limitation and presents an objective method for evaluating the independence of inert gas measurements. It demonstrates the linear dependence of the inert gas kernels and their filtering characteristics to be the factors most limiting information content. The limited number of gases available for measurement and experimental error are lesser limitations. At usual levels of experimental error, no more than seven different inert gases having partition coefficients between those of SF6 and acetone will provide independent information, and information content will be maximized by choosing gases with partition coefficients spaced equally on a logarithmic scale. A fivefold reduction in experimental error will not significantly alter the information content of the measurements. The analysis applies equally to other methods of multiple inert gas elimination data interpretation.\r"

Immersion has therefore gained increased acceptance in human physiology for the investigation of the effects of central volume expansion on renal function and hormonal responsiveness without altering the composition of the extracellular fluid. An immersion tank used for studies in humans is described. Requisite features to ensure study reproducibility include a constant temperature, capability to alter the depth of immersion by adjusting water height, and the ability to maintain hygienic quality by means of constant circulation of the water through a sand filter. A constant temperature of 34.5 +/- 0.2 degrees C is maintained by thermostatically controlling the heat exchange to a unidirectional closed-circuit water system in the bottom of the immersion tank coursing through a stream source. The level of the water may be adjusted to any desired level by means of a waste line or an inlet of tap water.\r"

Current procedure requires that a bolus of concentrated hypertonic saline be injected to measure absolute volume. It also demands that the subject be in a steady state and that measurements only be made at discrete intervals. The saline bolus may affect the cardiovascular state of the subject. This paper describes a new technique for estimating absolute volume utilizing the conductance catheter that relies on the different frequency responses of blood and muscle. Good correlation between the salt-injection method and the dual-frequency method was found in nine closed-chest pigs anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (r = 0.922). Further refinements may extend the utility of the dual-frequency approach.\r"

Maximal O2 uptake fell to 1.2 l/min, and arterial PO2 and PCO2 were 30 and 11 Torr, respectively, with arterial pH of 7.56. Many sophisticated studies were done: Swan-Ganz catheterization and inert gas diffusion studies at three altitudes showed that normal cardiac function persisted, pulmonary vascular resistance increased and at extreme altitude was not lowered by O2, and pulmonary ventilation-perfusion mismatch increased, though variably. This appears to be an important factor limiting performance at extreme altitude. This paper presents the background, general approach, and a summary of major observations reported in detail in other papers.\r"

Radioactivity from labeled MS and RBC's was measured by external detection using a gamma camera. We defined six regions of interest in the image of the left lateral surface of the lung: a dorsocaudal, a caudal, two ventral, an apical, and a central region. In each lung, regional trapping of MS was measured from the image of radioactivity obtained after slow injection of a suspension of MS into the arterial perfusion tubing. A radioactive bolus of labeled RBC's was injected during rapid imaging of the lung to obtain radioactivity vs. time curves from each region. The peaks of the regional radioactivity vs. time curves were used to estimate regional flows, though compensation had to be made for overlap of the washout and washin phases of the bolus of labeled RBC's. The results indicated that there were no differences in the regional distribution of MS compared with the regional distribution of RBC flow in isolated, perfused dog lungs.\r"

Blood density increased by 3.5 +/- 1.4 (SD) g/l when standing after sitting and decreased by 5.0 +/- 1.2 g/l while supine after standing. The corresponding half time of the blood density increase was 5.6 +/- 1.4 min (standing after sitting) and 6.9 +/- 3.1 min (supine after standing) of the blood density decrease. Erythrocyte density was calculated and did not change with body position. Whole-body blood density was calculated from plasma density, hematocrit, and erythrocyte density, assuming an F-cell ratio of 0.91.

Hypoxic rats exhibited pulmonary hypertension that was reversible on return to room air, but systemic arterial pressure was not altered by hypoxia. Systemic pressor responses to ANG I and ANG II were significantly less in the hypoxic rats than in the control rats at 14 and 28 days but returned to control levels in hypoxic animals that were then returned to room air, demonstrating reversibility of the hypoxia-induced changes in vascular reactivity. Pulmonary pressor responses to ANG I were significantly less at 14 days, whereas responses to ANG II were significantly greater at 28 days, in hypoxic rats than in controls. There were no significant differences in systemic and pulmonary pressor responses to phenylephrine between the hypoxic and air control animals. The altered systemic and pulmonary pressor responsiveness to ANG I and ANG II in hypoxic rats is probably related to mechanisms specific to the renin-angiotensin system, such as inhibition of intrapulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and down regulation of ANG II receptors in the systemic circulation. Further study is needed to elucidate these mechanisms.\r"

The hypoxic ventilatory response (expressed as the hyperbolic shape parameter A) was lower in the synchronized swimmers than controls with a mean value of 29.2 +/- 2.6 (SE) and 65.6 +/- 7.1, respectively (P less than 0.001). The hypercapnic ventilatory response [expressed as S, minute ventilation (1/min)/alveolar CO2 partial pressure (Torr)] was no different between synchronized swimmers and controls. Breath-hold duration during normoxia was greater in the synchronized swimmers, with a mean value of 108.6 +/- 4.8 (SE) vs. 68.03 +/- 8.1 s in the controls (P less than 0.001). No difference was seen in hyperoxic breath-hold times between groups. During breath holding synchronized swimmers demonstrated marked apneic bradycardia expressed as either absolute or heart rate change from basal heart rate as opposed to the controls, in whom heart rate increased during breath holds. Therefore the results show that elite synchronized swimmers have increased lung volumes, blunted hypoxic ventilatory responses, and a marked apneic bradycardia that may provide physiological characteristics that offer a competitive advantage for championship performance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

End-diastolic pressure (EDP) was varied by partial caval occlusion and dextran infusion. At each site the ln EDP-SL relation was fitted by linear regression and characterized by its slope and 1-Torr EDP intercept. The slope and 1-Torr intercept of the LV ln EDP-SL relation changed variably after pericardiectomy, but in each dog a change occurred that shifted this relation downward. In contrast, the RV inflow tract slope invariably decreased significantly after pericardiectomy, whereas its intercept was unchanged in all but one dog. The RV outflow tract results were similar to the inflow tract but less consistent. By the use of the raw EDP-SL data points, we calculated that the absolute contribution of the pericardium to EDP (i.e., the effective pericardial surface pressure) was similar at the three sites. However, as EDP values increased the proportional contribution of the pericardium to right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP) increased, whereas that to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) remained relatively constant. As a result, at the higher EDP values tested, the pericardium was responsible for a larger proportion of RVEDP than LVEDP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test this hypothesis, newborn rabbits were killed at different times in the first 24 h of life, their lungs lavaged with ice-cold saline, and the lavage fluid subfractionated by differential centrifugation. The phospholipid and protein content and composition and the kinetics of surface tension lowering of the subfractions were examined. We found that with the onset of breathing, shifts occur in the distribution of surfactant subfractions as a surfactant apoprotein-free phospholipid fraction is generated. The ratio of rapidly sedimentable apoprotein-rich to slowly sedimentable, apoprotein-free fractions decreases from 31 at birth to 4 at 24 h of life. Concurrently, rates of surface tension lowering by the subfractions increase with time. The results suggest that the adult pattern of pool sizes and surface activity of alveolar surfactant is not present at birth but evolves slowly over the 1st day of life.\r"

In this study the proximal end of the phrenic nerve was electrically stimulated, and the effects on ventilation were measured in supine dogs anesthetized with either alpha-chloralose or pentobarbital sodium. We found a maximum increase in ventilation of 45 +/- 4% in the alpha-chloralose group and an increase in mean arterial blood pressure of 18 +/- 4%. This response was obtained at high stimulus intensities (60 times twitch threshold). Stimulation of the proximal end of the gastrocnemius nerve produced a similar ventilatory response (61 +/- 10%) but at lower stimulus intensities. During pentobarbital sodium anesthesia both the hyperventilation and the pressor response were produced; however, ventilation was increased by an increase in respiratory frequency. The reflex was abolished by sectioning of the cervical dorsal roots (C4-C7). Proximal cold blockade of the nerve abolished the response at a perineural temperature of 1.35 +/- 0.64 degrees C. The main effect of activation of phrenic afferents was an increase in ventilation and blood pressure that was mediated by unmyelinated fibers and possibly thin myelinated fibers. This response is similar to skeletal muscle afferent activation and may play a role in ventilatory drive during such conditions as exercise and respiratory muscle fatigue.\r"

In both costal and crural regions, population distributions of SDH activities were unimodal for both type I and II fibers. The continuous distribution of SDH activities for type II fibers indicated that no clear threshold exists for the subclassification of fibers based on differences in oxidative capacity (e.g., the classification of fast-twitch glycolytic and fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic fiber types). No differences in either SDH activity or cross-sectional area were noted between fiber populations of the costal and crural regions. Differences in SDH activity and cross-sectional area were noted, however, between fiber populations located on the abdominal and thoracic sides of the costal region. Both type I and II fibers on the abdominal side of the costal diaphragm were larger and more oxidative than comparable fibers on the thoracic side.\r"

The age groups were matched on the basis of maximal O2 consumption (VO2max), body surface area, and body fatness. After heat acclimation the women walked at 40% VO2max for up to 2 h in the hot dry environment while heart rate (HR), rectal temperature (Tre), mean skin temperature (Tsk), whole-body sweating rate (Msw), and local sweating rates (msw; forearm, chest, and scapula) were measured. Additionally, the density of heat-activated sweat glands (HASG) was determined and average sweat gland flow (SGF) was calculated for the scapular area. Although no differences between age groups were found in HR response (when analyzed as percent of maximal HR) or Tsk, the older women had a significantly higher Tre throughout the heat-exercise session. The greater heat storage of the older women may be explained by their significantly lower Msw and msw. There were no differences between the younger and older women in the density of HASG after 30 min; therefore, the lower msw reflects a diminished output per HASG rather than a decrease in the number of sweat glands recruited. The diminished thermoregulatory ability of the older women, unrelated to differences in VO2max, appears to reflect either 1) a diminished response of the sweat glands to central and/or peripheral stimuli, or 2) an age-related structural alteration in the eccrine glands or surrounding skin cells.\r"

The magnitude of decrement in evaporative cooling is a function of the clothing's resistance to permeation of water vapor. A physiological approach has been used to derive effective evaporative coefficients (he) which define this ability to evaporate sweat. We refined this approach by correcting the critical effective evaporative coefficient (K for sweating efficiency (Ke,eta') since only a portion of the sweat produced under such conditions is evaporated through the clothing. Six acclimated men and women walked at 30% maximal O2 consumption (150-200 W.m-2) at a constant dry bulb temperature as ambient water vapor pressure was systematically increased 1 Torr every 10 min. Critical pressure was defined as the partial pressure of water vapor (Pw) at which thermal balance could no longer be maintained and rectal temperature rose sharply. Each test was performed in various clothing ensembles ranging from cotton shirt and pants to \"impermeable\" suits. This approach was used to derive he by solving the general heat balance equation, M - W +/- (R + C) = w.he.(Psk - Pw), where M is metabolic heat production, W is external work, R is radiant heat exchange, C is convective heat transfer, w is skin wettedness, and Psk is water vapor pressure of fully wet skin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Effects of age on the pulmonary vascular responses to histamine (HIST), norepinephrine (NE), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and KCl were studied in isolated, perfused lungs from juvenile (7-wk-old), adult (14-wk-old), and mature adult (28-wk-old) normoxic rats and compared with age-matched rats exposed to chronic hypoxia for either 14 or 28 days. Chronic hypoxia changed vasoconstriction to HIST and NE to vasodilation in lungs from juvenile and adult rats. Mature adult lungs only vasoconstricted to these amines in both control and hypoxic animals. Pressor responses to 5-HT were not affected by chronic hypoxia regardless of age group. Pressor responses to KCl were also not altered by hypoxia, but lungs from older rats showed greater control responsiveness to KCl compared with lungs from juveniles. Only lungs from juvenile animals developed significant elevations of base-line resistance as a result of hypoxic exposure. To investigate the contribution of H1-, H2-, and beta-receptors in these changes, we employed chlorpheniramine, metiamide, and propranolol, respectively, as blocking agents in another series of experiments. Chlorpheniramine either reduced vasoconstriction or increased vasodilation to HIST in lungs from both control and hypoxic animals, whereas metiamide was without effect. Propranolol either increased vasoconstriction or reversed vasodilation to HIST and NE in all lungs studied. The present data demonstrate the important interaction between chronic hypoxia and age that can alter pulmonary vascular tone and reactivity. The inverse relationship between age and elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance after chronic hypoxic exposure may be the key element that changes pulmonary vascular reactivity observed during hypoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These workers used the combined effects of PO2 and time of exposure to develop recommendations to limit expected % delta VC. Adopting this general approach, we fitted human pulmonary O2 toxicity data to the hyperbolic equation % delta VC = Bs.(PO2 - B1).(time)B3 using a nonlinear least squares analysis. In addition to the data considered in 1970, our analysis included new data available from the literature. The best fit was obtained when 1) an individual slope parameter, Bs, was estimated for each subject instead of an average slope; 2) PO2 asymptote B1 = 0.38 ATA; and 3) exponent B3 = 1.0. Wide individual variation imposed large uncertainty on any % delta VC prediction. A 12-h exposure to a PO2 of 1 ATA would be expected to yield a median VC decrement of 4%. The 80% confidence limits, however, included changes from +1.0 and -12% delta VC. Until an improved index of pulmonary O2 toxicity is developed, a simplified expression % delta VC = -0.011.(PO2 - 0.5).time (PO2 in ATA and time in min) can be used to predict a median response with little loss in predictability. The limitations of changes in VC as an index are discussed.\r"

The relationship between Pes and airway opening pressure (Pao) was recorded. In all instances, the changes in Pes and Pao were virtually identical in both amplitude and phase. We conclude that, as evaluated by the occlusion test, a catheter-tip pressure transducer placed in the esophagus of rabbits can give adequate estimation of local pleural changes up to at least 50 Hz.\r"

The greatest changes induced by allergen exposure involved small-molecular-weight proteins (less than 345,000) and an inverse correlation was observed between log molecular weight and percent increase in the concentrations of the specific proteins; r = -0.61. BAL-serum distribution coefficients of serum proteins in airway fluids reflected a greater diffusability of low-molecular-weight proteins immediately after allergen exposure. We also evaluated the movement of serum proteins into lung after local allergen exposure using intravenously administered 99mTc-albumin (n = 10) and found an immediate 3.8-fold increase in amounts of radioactive albumin in allergen exposed airways compared with airways exposed to diluent. Most of the radioactivity was recovered in the first 5 ml of aliquot withdrawn, suggesting a marked increase in the permeability of the bronchial (large airway) vascular-epithelial membrane. An increase in serum proteins was also observed in BAL fluid of asthmatics 2-4 h after aerosol challenge (n = 4), including all proteins in the molecular weight range 45,000-900,000. These studies suggest that allergen exposure in sensitive asthmatics causes an acute increase in bronchovascular permeability to serum proteins.\r"

Expressed as %Po, tetanic stress-stimulation frequency curves and tetanic stress-length curves were identical.

The provocative concentration of each agonist was measured on two randomly assigned days separated by at least 1 wk. On one day a control experiment was performed, and on the other day the dogs were pretreated with the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium bromide in doses that block ganglionic transmission. The acetylcholine provocative concentration decreased on the control day from 5.5 mg/ml (%SE 1.8) before ozone to 0.5 mg/ml (%SE 2.0) after ozone (P less than 0.0001). After pretreatment with hexamethonium the acetylcholine provocative concentration decreased from 9.0 mg/ml (%SE 1.8) before ozone to 1.0 mg/ml (%SE 2.0) after ozone (P = 0.002). The results were similar when histamine was used as the agonist. Therefore, ganglionic blockade does not prevent airway hyperresponsiveness after ozone inhalation, and a parasympathetic reflex mechanism is not responsible for airway hyperresponsiveness after ozone inhalation in dogs.\r"

Statistical data are presented in this report. It was found that the probability frequency functions of the widths of both the collagen and elastin fibers are skewed to the right, but the fourth roots of the widths are normally distributed. Hence, knowing the mean and standard deviation of (width)1/4, the probability of finding fiber bundles of width D is known. On the other hand, we already know the analytic expressions of the strain energy per unit length of fibers of given width. With the probability distribution of width and an estimation of the length of alveolar mouths, the strain energy of the alveolar mouths can be computed. Then the contribution of the alveolar mouths to the stress in the lung parenchyma due to any strain can be obtained by a differentiation of the strain energy function with respect to that strain.\r"

The model was then used to obtain predictions of regional and total deposition of heterodispersed hygroscopic aerosol particles (droplets of NaCl solutions). Parameters that were varied in the hygroscopic calculations include initial droplet NaCl concentration, time of inspiration and expiration, volume of aerosol inspired, period of breath holding, and initial inhaled lognormal aerosol mass median diameter and geometric standard deviation. Results of the computer calculations show that increasing heterodispersity tends to flatten and broaden regional deposition curves when fraction of inhaled mass deposited is plotted vs. inhaled mass median aerodynamic particle diameter. Hygroscopicity is shown to increase tracheobronchial and pulmonary airway deposition with hypertonic NaCl solution aerosols showing increases over isotonic and nonhygroscopic aerosols of up to 200%.\r"

With these values, the model predicts that pulmonary deposition can be increased by greater than 100% relative to the deposition achieved in conventional inhalation therapy with isotonic saline-based medications.\r"

Six male subjects performed a total of six exercise (O2 uptake = 1.2 l/min) tests in a hot environment (ambient temperature = 38 degrees C, relative humidity = 30%) while dressed in clothing having low moisture permeability and high insulation. Each subject completed two upper body exercise (U; arm crank) tests: 1) with only the torso surface (T) cooled; and 2) with the surfaces of both the torso and upper arms (TA) cooled [coolant temperature at the inlet (Ti) was 20 degrees C for all upper body tests]. Each subject also completed four lower body exercise (L; walking) tests: 1) with only the T cooled (Ti = 20 degrees C); 2) with only the T cooled (Ti = 26 degrees C); 3) with torso, upper arm, and thigh surface (TAT) cooled (Ti = 20 degrees C); and 4) with TAT cooled (Ti = 26 degrees C). During U exercise, TA cooling had no effects compared with cooling only T. During L exercise, sweat rates, heart rates, and rectal temperature (Tre) changes were less with TAT cooling compared with cooling only the T. Altering Ti had no effect on Tre changes, but higher heart rates were observed with 26 than with 20 degrees C. These data indicate that cooling arms during upper body exercise provides no thermoregulatory advantage, although cooling the thigh surfaces during lower body exercise does provide an advantage.\r"

Subjects were studied while standing at rest and at 25, 50, and 75% of maximal arm-cranking VO2. At each level, rest or work was continued for 6 min with MAST inflated and for 6 min with MAST deflated. Order of inflation and deflation was alternated at each experimental rest or exercise level. Measurements were obtained during the last 2 min at each level. Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed significant increases (P less than 0.001) in Q, SV, and MABP and a consistent decrease in HR with MAST inflation. There was no apparent change in Q/VO2 between inflated and control conditions. There was no effect of MAST inflation on VO2 or TPR. MAST inflation counteracts the gravitational effect of venous return in upright exercise, restoring central blood volume and thereby increasing Q and MABP from control. HR is decreased consequent to increased MABP through arterial baroreflexes. The associated decrease in TPR is not observed, being offset by the mechanical compression of leg vasculature with MAST inflation.\r"

Training did not change pulmonary function values, except for a small increase in maximal voluntary ventilation (P less than 0.02), which was attributed to respiratory muscle training. After aerobic training, both external work at a given heart rate and peak O2 consumption increased by 30 and 15%, respectively. At the same minute ventilation (VE), immediate postexercise forced expiratory airflow was higher after training (P less than 0.02), and reduction in forced expiratory airflow during the first 9 min postexercise was less after training (P less than 0.01). The posttraining airflow response to the pretraining work load was, as expected, less than the pretraining response (P less than 0.02). Although the difference in maximal-to-minimal airflow at the same VE was similar before and after training, the airflow increase accounted for 50% of the response after training compared with 16% of the pretraining response. Furthermore the strong negative correlation (P less than 0.01) between maximal and minimal airflow both pre- and posttraining indicates that exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) severity is, in part, determined by the degree of exercise-induced bronchodilation. We conclude that aerobic training significantly increases exercise-induced bronchodilation and diminishes EIB.\r"

Physiological measures obtained included maximal and submaximal O2 consumption, muscle fiber composition, and measures of the ability to store and return elastic energy during knee bends. A subset of 16 runners was also evaluated in relation to performance in a 10-km run. Biomechanical variables were identified which showed significant differences or consistent trends between groups separated on the basis of VO2 submax, establishing the importance of biomechanical influences on running economy. It appears that no single variable or small subset of variables can explain differences in economy between individuals but rather that economy is related to a weighted sum of the influences of many variables.\r"

When tissue metabolic activity and O2 demand are increased or reduced, the critical QO2 required to maintain VO2 should rise or fall accordingly, unless other changes in the distribution of a limited QO2 precipitate the onset of O2 supply dependence at a different critical extraction ratio. We compared the critical QO2 and critical extraction ratio in 23 normothermic (38 degrees C), hyperthermic (41 degrees C), or hypothermic (34 decrees C) dogs during stepwise reduction in delivery produced by bleeding, as arterial O2 content was maintained. Dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated. Hypothermia reduced whole-body VO2 by 31%, whereas hyperthermia increased VO2 by 20%. The critical QO2 was significantly reduced during hypothermia (5.6 +/- 0.95 ml.min-1.kg-1) (P less than 0.05) and increased during hyperthermia (8.9 +/- 1.1) (P approximately equal to 0.06) compared with normothermic controls (7.4 +/- 1.2). The extraction ratio at the onset of supply dependency was significantly increased in hyperthermia (0.76 +/- 0.05) compared with hypothermia (0.65 +/- 0.10) (P less than 0.05), and the normothermic critical extraction was 0.71 +/- 0.1. These results suggest that higher body temperatures are associated with an improved ability to maintain a VO2 independent of QO2, since a higher fraction of the delivered O2 can be extracted before the onset of O2 supply dependence, relative to lower body temperatures.\r"

Regional velocity was estimated by measuring regional RBC transit times and was correlated with the retention of PMN found in the same lung sample 10 min after the injection of a bolus of labeled cells. Data from the whole lung showed that the total number of cells marginated in the pulmonary vasculature was 2.4 times as great as the number present in the circulation and that this pool turned over at a rate of 1%/s. The regional data showed increased retention, indicating slower PMN turnover in the upper lung regions, which have longer transit times and therefore slower blood velocities than the RBC is attributed to a greater discrepancy between PMN and RBC is attributed to a greater discrepancy between PMN and capillary size and the fact that PMN are less deformable than RBC. The large number of capillary segments present in the lung allows neutrophils to move more slowly while RBC stream around them. We conclude that there are approximately 2.5 times as many PMNs marginated in the lung as there are in the total circulating blood volume of the dog and that the pulmonary marginated pool turns over at approximately 1%/s with slower turnover in the upper compared with the lower regions of the lung.\r"

From this model an estimator model is developed that produces simultaneous estimations of the diffusing capacity of the lung for CO and the fraction of the pulmonary capillary blood that is stationary. The estimator model was tested using simulated data from uniform and non-uniform simulators and found to be only mildly sensitive to noise and incorrect values for the pulmonary capillary blood volume. Both the estimator model and breath-to-breath changes in the diffusing capacity of the lung for CO (exhaled) were found to be greatly affected by inhomogeneity of diffusing capacity and ventilation. At times both returned false positive results that limit their use as a screening test for stationary pulmonary blood. Although changes in CO uptake may at times indicate the presence of stationary pulmonary blood, the confounding effects of inhomogeneity of ventilation and diffusing capacity make the use of such changes impractical under most circumstances.\r"

This situation was evaluated in a sheep model. Under halothane anesthesia one lung was insufflated with cotton smoke and the other with air. EVTV values were 8.4 +/- 0.48 ml/kg at base line and were not elevated at 24 h after smoke inhalation (8.3 +/- 0.45 ml/kg; means +/- SE). Gravimetric analysis 24 h after smoke inhalation showed the development of edema in smoke-exposed lungs. The blood-free wet weight-to-dry weight ratio of the smoke-exposed lungs (5.4 +/- 0.32) was significantly higher compared with the contralateral unsmoked lungs (4.3 +/- 0.15; P less than or equal to 0.05). The thermal-dye technique thus underestimates EVLW. Poor perfusion of the smoke-exposed lungs 24 h after injury was demonstrated indirectly by killing a group of sheep with T-61, an agent that causes a dark red coloration of well-perfused lung areas, as well as directly by measurement of blood flow utilizing a radiolabeled microsphere technique. Thus the inability of the thermal-dye technique to detect the lung edema may be the result of poor perfusion of the injured lung.\r"

We then 1) mechanically irritated the trachea, 2) intravenously administered capsaicin (5 micrograms/kg), or 3) induced hypoxia (arterial PO2 30-40 Torr) to stimulate irritant and bronchial C-fiber receptors, pulmonary C-fiber receptors, or the carotid body (chemoreceptors), respectively. After treatment with atropine (3 mg/kg iv) and propranolol (2 mg/kg iv), the serotonin-induced change in RL was reduced by 58.6 +/- 14.3% by mechanical irritation and 63.3 +/- 12.1% by intravenous capsaicin. However, hypoxia produced no dilatation of the airways. In further experiments, we employed capsaicin inhalation to stimulate bronchial C-fiber receptors. Inhaled capsaicin (0.1%, for 5 breaths) also reduced RL by 79.2 +/- 9.2% of the elevated value, after atropine and propranolol. Treatment with a ganglionic blocking agent, hexamethonium (2 mg/kg iv), abolished bronchodilator responses, implying that a reflex pathway through vagal nerves is involved in this phenomenon. These results suggest that pulmonary and bronchial C-fiber receptors may be involved as sensory receptors in NAIS reflex bronchodilatation.\r"

Fourteen subjects performed 90-min rides on a cycle ergometer at a work rate equivalent to 40% of their control maximal O2 uptake under each of three treatments provided in a randomized double-blind manner: atenolol (100 mg/day), propranolol (160 mg/day), and a placebo. Exercise during the propranolol trial resulted in significantly higher forearm vascular resistance values and significantly lower forearm blood flows (FBF) compared with the placebo trial. However, the significantly lower FBF during propranolol did not significantly alter the rectal temperature (Tre) response to prolonged exercise. In addition, both beta-blockers produced lower FBF for any given Tre, suggesting that beta-adrenergic blockade affects FBF through nonthermal factors. The slight differences in Tre, despite the large differences in FBF between the various treatments, are apparently the result of an enhanced sweat loss and a lower mean skin temperature during exercise with beta-blockade. The uncoupling of FBF and sweat loss provides evidence of independent regulation. The reduction in FBF at any given Tre was concomitant to lower blood pressure values during beta-blockade and suggests that baroreflexes provide significant input to the control of skin blood flow when both pressure and temperature maintenance are simultaneously challenged.\r"

To aid understanding we have developed a simple model that allows prediction of the effect on chest wall motion of changes in applied forces. The model is a lever system on which the forces generated actively by the respiratory muscles and passively by impedances of rib cage, lungs, abdomen, and diaphragm act at fixed sites. A change in forces results in translational and/or rotational motion of the lever; motion represents volume change. The distribution and magnitude of passive relative to active forces determine the locus and degree of rotation and therefore the effect of an applied force on motion of the chest wall, allowing the interaction of diaphragm, rib cage, and abdomen to be modeled. Analysis of moments allow equations to be derived that express the effect on chest wall motion of the active component in terms of the passive components. These equations may be used to test the model by comparing predicted with empirical behavior. The model is simple, appears valid for a variety of respiratory maneuvers, is useful in interpreting relative motion of rib cage and abdomen and may be useful in quantifying the effective forces acting on the rib cage.\r"

The slope of the slow component of the washout curves was inversely related to the tissue-blood partition coefficient in the subcutaneous tissue (r = 0.52, P less than 0.001), indicating an influence of the amount of subcutaneous fat on the washout rate. QXe calculated from the slow component of the washout curves was not significantly correlated with Qm in the subcutaneous compartment (r = 0.19, P greater than 0.10).

In this study we investigated the influence of mild exercise on transit of a liquid meal from the mouth to the large intestine. Orocecal transit time was determined by a consistent elevation of H2 concentration in a rebreathing apparatus after ingestion of 30 g lactulose; the lactulose was part of a 360-kcal, 350-ml liquid meal. Comparison of transit time was made, in 12 young healthy subjects, between seated rest and a treadmill walk at 5.6 km/h up a 2% grade. The walk elevated heart rate from 64 +/- 4 to 109 +/- 5 beats/min, O2 uptake (VO2) from 0.29 +/- 0.02 to 1.20 +/- 0.07 l/min STPD, and final rectal temperature from 37.0 +/- 0.1 to 38.3 +/- 0.1 degrees C (all P less than 0.01). Exercise speeded transit of the liquid meal, with mean rises in H2 concentration taking place 66 +/- 10 min after ingestion at rest, compared with 44 +/- 6 min after food intake during exercise (P less than 0.02). H2 concentrations in the rebreathing apparatus showed similar base lines in the two experiments, and quantitative increases in H2 concentration, although shifted in time by exercise, were otherwise identical. Subjects with the slowest resting transit rates showed the largest exercise effects (r = 0.79, P less than 0.05). These results indicate that mouth-to-cecum transit of at least the first portion of a liquid meal-based nonabsorbable carbohydrate marker is significantly accelerated during mild exercise.\r"

We addressed this question, in the same preparation, by comparing responses to NE under four conditions in each experimental animal (n = 12): 1) NE infused during normoxia; 2) NE infused after vascular resistance (Rpv) was increased with serotonin; 3) NE infused after Rpv was increased by H; 4) NE infused after lobar pressure was raised by an increase in flow (P/F). PO2 values during H were varied (27-56 Torr). S and H produced a 137 +/- 35 and 43 +/- 8% delta Rpv increase in lobar vascular resistance, respectively. P/F increased lobar pressure 91 +/- 10%. Only NE infusion during H demonstrated significant differences in lobar pressure and Rpv compared with control normoxic periods. There was no correlation between responses to NE during S, H, and P/F and degree to which each stimulus increased Rpv or lobar pressure (r = 0.003, 0.28, 0.24). A significant relationship between response to NE during H vs. PO2 during H was observed (r = 0.78; P less than 0.001). In a subset of animals, we repeated the infusion of NE during H and P/F post-beta-blockade. The decrease in vascular response to NE during H and the correlation of PO2 with NE response were abolished (n = 7).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ratio of pressure to flow gave vascular resistance (Rtv). Lung airflow, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and pressure in a cervical tracheal balloon (Ptr) were also measured. In paralyzed dogs, systemic hypoxia due to artificial ventilation with 10% O2-90% N2 increased Rtv by +8.1 +/- 1.0% (SE), Ptr by +76 +/- 22.8%, and BP by +18.9 +/- 24%. After bilateral cervical vagosympathectomy the increases in Rtv and BP were present (+8.8 +/- 0.9 and +22.3 +/- 0.3%, respectively). After carotid body denervation Rtv, Ptr, and BP increased (+6.4 +/- 1.3, +58.6 +/- 31.6, and +14.6 +/- 3.3%, respectively). After vagotomy Rtv and BP increased (+14.1 +/- 1.7 and +22.4 +/- 10.1%, respectively). Tracheal perfusion with hypoxic blood caused a small vasodilation (-2.2 +/- 1.1%). Systemic hypercapnia due to artificial ventilation with 8% CO2-92% air increased Rtv by +16.7 +/- 3.8%, Ptr by +67 +/- 2.0%, and BP by +12.9 +/- 9.9%. Tracheal perfusion with hypercapnic blood caused a small vasodilation (-2.5 +/- 1.2%). Stimulation of the carotid body chemoreceptors with KCN caused a small increase in Rtv (+1.2 +/- 0.5%) and increases in Ptr (+49.8 +/- 13.6%) and BP (+11.1 +/- 2.1%). Systemic hypoxia and hypercapnia caused tracheal vasoconstriction mainly by an action on the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "Mucociliary function is a primary defense mechanism of the tracheobronchial airways, and yet the response of this system to an inhalational hazard, such as ozone, is undefined in humans. Utilizing noninvasive techniques to measure deposition and retention of insoluble radiolabeled particles on airway mucous membranes, we studied the effect on mucus transport of 0.2 and 0.4 ppm ozone compared with filtered air (FA) in seven healthy males. During 2-h chamber exposures, subjects alternated between periods of rest and light exercise with hourly spirometric measurement of lung function. Mechanical and mucociliary function responses to ozone by lung airways appeared concentration dependent. Reduction in particle retention was significant (P less than 0.005) (i.e., transport of lung mucus was increased during exposure to 0.4 ppm ozone and was coincident with impaired lung function; e.g., forced vital capacity and midmaximal flow rate fell by 12 and 16%, respectively, and forced expiratory volume at 1 s by 5%, of preexposure values). Regional analysis indicated that mucus flow from distal airways into central bronchi was significantly increased (P less than 0.025) by 0.2 ppm ozone. This peripheral effect, however, was buffered by only a marginal influence of 0.2 ppm ozone on larger bronchi, such that the resultant mucus transport for all airways of the lung in aggregate differed only slightly from FA exposures. These data may reflect differences in regional diffusion of ozone along the respiratory tract, rather than tissue sensitivity. In conclusion, mucociliary function of humans is acutely stimulated by ozone and may result from fluid additions to the mucus layer from mucosal and submucosal secretory cells and/or alteration of epithelial permeability.\r"

All had had a positive clinical diagnosis just after the injury, which was confirmed in the majority under anesthesia, at arthrotomy, on arthroscopy, or with a combination of these methods. The re-examination was performed an average of eight years after the injury. Besides a functional and objective evaluation, radiographic examination and evaluations of isokinetic and isometric strength were made. The multidimensional analysis revealed that in an unselected population the long-term results of the complete tears were poor, because of chronic instability. In many, reconstructive operations were needed, and post-traumatic arthritis was common. In the patients who had a partial tear, the results were quite good even if the stability of the knees had not improved when compared with the initial post-traumatic status. Conservative treatment of complete tears of the anterior cruciate ligament cannot be recommended as a treatment of choice, whereas partial tears can be treated by non-operative methods.\r"

Eleven patients had multiarticular rheumatoid arthritis; fourteen, osteoarthritis; and one, multiarticular neuropathic arthropathy. Systemic signs of infection were eliminated in all patients and local signs, in 89 per cent of the patients. After resection arthroplasty alone, fifteen patients were able to walk independently. Six patients with monoarticular osteoarthritis who found the resection arthroplasty to be unacceptable had a successful secondary arthrodesis. In three patients a spontaneous bone fusion developed after the resection, with the knee in a good position. Two patients who were unable to walk before the resection arthroplasty were still unable to do so postoperatively. Neither the patient's disease nor the type of prosthesis that had been used was a reliable predictor of success of the resection arthroplasty. The patients who had had the most severe disability before the total knee arthroplasty were most likely to be satisfied. Patients who had had less disability were more likely to find the results of resection arthroplasty to be unsatisfactory.\r"

The patterns in eighteen normal hips in twelve adults were mapped in detail. The cross-sectional areas of the abductor muscles were measured and vectors representing the total pull of the abductor muscle in the frontal and sagittal planes were constructed for each hip. The variations in individual and composite muscular anatomy were recorded. The inclination of the axis of the abductor muscle ranged from 17 to 26 degrees (standard deviation, 2.9 degrees) in the frontal plane and from -2 to 14 degrees (standard deviation, 4.2 degrees) in the sagittal plane.\r"

On the average, strength reached 80 per cent of normal in abduction and 90 per cent of normal in external rotation at one year postoperatively. Strength of forward flexion reached 75 per cent of normal. In seventeen patients with paired data (recorded at both six and twelve months), an increase in strength (p less than 0.05) was found for each motion and speed that was tested. Patients who had a small tear scored higher than those who had a large tear, but not to a significant degree.

Using a rating system that included subjective, objective, and roentgenographic criteria, it did not appear that reduction of the acromioclavicular joint was necessary to obtain consistently good results. Operative management, using either coracoclavicular or acromioclavicular fixation, was associated with a higher rate of complications than non-operative treatment. The use of a sling for four weeks without reduction of the joint, followed by a graduated exercise program, led to acceptable clinical results. In patients who had persistent pain and stiffness of the acromioclavicular joint, or in whom symptomatic post-traumatic arthritis developed, resection of the distal part of the clavicle reliably produced significant improvement.\r"

  ".U": "88007739\r", 
  ".W": "Findings from biomechanical analyses of gait were used to estimate the optimum position of arthrodesis of the ankle. Nineteen patients who were followed for an average of 10.4 years (range, four to seventeen years) were studied. By including the knee in the analysis as well as studying the effects on gait of different ground conditions, objective data for the weight-bearing extremities in the transverse, sagittal, and coronal planes were generated. Genu recurvatum was shown to be associated with a plantar-flexion position of fusion of the ankle. Laxity of the medial collateral ligament of the knee was noted in twelve patients (63 per cent). Among these patients, in three (16 per cent) the laxity was graded as moderate to severe, possibly due to external rotation of the extremity during gait to avoid rolling over the rigid plantar-flexed ankle. The patterns of gait showed that a valgus position of the arthrodesis is more advantageous and provides more normal gait, particularly on uneven ground. To attain more normal function of the knee and improve performance on rough ground, the optimum position of arthrodesis of the ankle appears to be neutral flexion, slight (zero to 5 degrees) valgus angulation, and approximately 5 to 10 degrees of external rotation. Posterior displacement of the talus under the tibia tends to produce a more normal pattern of gait and decreases the stress at the knee. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study has shown the ideal position of fusion of the ankle to be neutral flexion, slight (zero to 5 degrees) valgus angulation of the hind part of the foot, and 5 to 10 degrees of external rotation. This position allows the greatest compensatory motion at the foot and places the least strain on the knee.\r"

  ".W": "In joints with bacterial arthritis, continuing prolonged destruction of cartilage may occur in spite of prompt, effective antibiotic therapy. We measured the extent to which early antibiotic therapy with ceforanide altered the degradation of the cartilage after arthritis due to Staphylococcus aureus had been produced in the knee joint in rabbits. Degradation of the cartilage was quantified by analyses for glycosaminoglycan and collagen. Three weeks after the infection was produced, the cartilage had lost more than half of its glycosaminoglycan whether the antibiotic therapy had been started at one, two, or seven days after infection. Beginning the antibiotic treatment one day after infection reduced over-all loss of collagen by 37 per cent and decreased the area of erosion of the infected articular surfaces. When antibiotic treatment was begun at four, eight, or twelve hours after infection, the loss of glycosaminoglycan averaged 18 per cent. Prophylaxis with antibiotics completely prevented any degradation of the cartilage. Clinical relevance: The findings reported here show how rapidly cartilage loses glycosaminoglycan when it is involved by arthritis caused by staphylococci and how early treatment of the infection reduces the loss of collagen. There is less protection against loss of glycosaminoglycan. The results emphasize the need for early diagnosis and treatment of infectious synovitis and support the rationale for early administration of antibiotics without waiting for identification of the responsible bacteria.\r"

The minimum length of follow-up was six years or until death. The surgical margin was wide in all patients according to the definition of the surgical staging system of Enneking et al., but we defined three types of wide margin. None of them included a whole anatomical compartment, so that the radical resection, as defined by the surgical staging system, was excluded from the study. The crude rates of local recurrence in the three subgroups that were studied differed significantly. There was no correlation between the rate of local recurrence and the histological grade of malignancy. Our findings suggest that the subclassification of the wide margin that we have applied to the surgical staging system of Enneking et al. is of value. The low rates of recurrence (less than 10 per cent) for subcutaneous lesions, and intramuscular lesions that were treated by primary myectomy, were comparable with those of radical resections and usually were followed by minor loss of function. The higher rate of recurrence (30 per cent) for the third subgroup, which included deep tumors that were not treated by myectomy, was comparable with the rates found in other studies.\r"
