The cause of this disorder is probably an abnormal fibroproliferative response to an inflammatory stimulus, most commonly a granulomatous infection secondary to Histoplasma capsulatum. The pathophysiology of this disease is predicated on the encasement of mediastinal vital organ structures within a dense fibrotic mass. This mass appears to emanate from an invasive chronic inflammatory process causing erosion as well as external compression of these structures. The following case reports illustrate the diversity of this disease entity, representing a patient population from the Ohio River Valley, endemic for histoplasmosis. The purpose of this report is to elucidate the various clinical manifestations of sclerosing mediastinitis and to correlate the pathologic process with a rational approach to treatment.\r"

We compared the effects of high frequency jet ventilation and intermittent positive pressure ventilation on CBF in 24 patients investigated three hours after completion of open-heart surgery. The patients were investigated during three consecutive periods with standard sedation (morphine, pancuronium): a. IPPV; b. HFJV; c. IPPV. Partial pressure of arterial CO2 (PaCO2: 4.5-5.5 kPa) and rectal temperature (35.5 to 37.5 degrees C) were maintained constant during the study. The CBF was measured by intravenous 133Xe washout technique. The following variables were derived from the cerebral clearance of 133Xe: the rapid compartment flow, the initial slope index, ie, a combination of the rapid and the slow compartment flows, and the ratio of fast compartment flow over total CBF (FF). Compared to IPPV, HFJV applied to result in the same mean airway pressure did not produce any change in pulmonary gas exchange, mean systemic arterial pressure, and cardiac index. Similarly, CBF was not significantly altered by HFJV. However, important variations of CBF values were observed in three patients, although the classic main determinants of CBF (PaCO2, cerebral perfusion pressure, Paw, temperature) remained unchanged. Our results suggest that in patients with normal systemic hemodynamics, the effects of HFJV and IPPV on CBF are comparable at identical levels of mean airway pressure.\r"

They received either 5 mg nebulized salbutamol followed by 0.5 mg ipratropium, ipratropium followed by salbutamol, or both drugs administered together followed by nebulized saline. Ipratropium was an effective bronchodilator when given as the first agent. Simultaneous administration with salbutamol was as effective as sequential administration. At one hour after treatment, there was no difference in peak flow between the combination of drugs and either drug given alone. Ipratropium given after salbutamol was not superior to saline solution given after the combination of drugs.

Group 1 patients were successfully extubated in less than or equal to 14 days after onset of ARDS and group 2 patients remained intubated greater than 14 days. On day 7 of ARDS, group 1 had a higher PaO2/PAO2 ratio, a lower PEEP requirement, less severe chest radiographic abnormalities and a greater likelihood of an improved radiograph from the baseline study. None of group 1 and 11 group 2 patients eventually underwent tracheotomy. Clinical features apparent after seven days of mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS suggest the likelihood of prolonged intubation beyond 14 days and eventual tracheotomy. Recognition of these features may allow more timely conversion of endotracheal intubation to tracheotomy.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic bronchitis is characterized by mucociliary dysfunction resulting from structural and functional defects of cilia and the secretory apparatus. The combination of hypersecretion and ciliary impairment leads to disruption of mucociliary interaction and hence the accumulation of secretions in the lower airways. Cigarette smoke appears to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of chronic bronchitis-associated mucociliary dysfunction. While the excessive lower airway secretions may have only minor effects on the natural course of airflow obstruction, they could transiently compromise airway function during acute exacerbations. In addition, altered aerosol deposition in the airways resulting from excessive airway secretions could influence the airway responses to inhaled irritants and pharmacologic agents. There are currently no direct, non-invasive methods available to assess the quantity and distribution of airway secretions in vivo. Indirect indices such as cough frequency, sputum volume, respiratory function, and mucociliary clearance are nonspecific and subject to misinterpretation. The clinical utility of mucotropic pharmacologic agents and of physical maneuvers directed at removing excessive lower airway secretions is therefore difficult to evaluate objectively.\r"

  ".W": "If one includes all types of chronic generalized airways obstruction under the heading of \"COPD,\" diagnosis of this condition requires only the demonstration of an obstructive ventilatory impairment on spirometric testing that persists despite maximum medical therapy. However, as generally used, the term COPD implies that upper airways obstruction and \"specific\" lung diseases that can produce an obstructive type of physiologic abnormality have been excluded. Examples of these exclusions include silicosis, sarcoidosis, and even advanced tuberculous disease. It is more difficult to determine the type of disease that is causing the chronic airways obstruction in patients with COPD as defined above. A severe and persistent form of asthma, sometimes called \"chronic asthmatic bronchitis,\" can mimic the typical emphysematous form of COPD that is characteristic of heavy cigarette smokers. Since these types of chronic airflow obstruction differ in regard to their clinical courses, prognoses, and treatments, their distinction is clinically important. One should not be discouraged by the fact that some patients appear to have a mixed type of disorder. Features that help differentiate the various forms of chronic airways obstruction are described in this report, and recommendations are offered to help guide the practitioner in the workup indicated for patients thought to have any type of chronic airways obstruction. It is also emphasized that patients vary markedly in regard to the relative importance of readily reversible bronchospasm, airways inflammation, and mucus hypersecretion in producing their disability. Assessment of these factors is critical in determining clinical management.\r"

  ".W": "The fifth leading cause of death in the United States, chronic obstructive respiratory conditions, cannot be cured but can be considerably ameliorated by appropriate management. Many patients with COPD have a combination of chronic bronchitis, asthma, and emphysema. While the damage due to emphysema is permanent, many of the pathophysiologic changes of asthma and bronchitis can be reversed to some extent, and such reversal should be a goal of therapy. Smoking cessation will help the patient more than any other medical treatment. Bronchodilator therapy is best given by inhalation from a metered dose inhaler and on a maintenance basis. Be sure to check inhaler technique. An anticholinergic agent, eg, ipratropium bromide, is probably most effective, but many patients prefer a beta 2-selective adrenergic agent. Xanthines are currently third choice but are very useful to cover nocturnal dyspnea. Corticosteroids are usually only used in acute exacerbations and then only for short courses. If prolonged use is required, however, the inhalation route minimizes side effects to which these patients are particularly prone. Antibiotics are also usually only used in exacerbations, but one can be liberal with them. Use the less expensive broad-spectrum options for ten days. Some clinicians believe that hydration is an effective expectorant. Mucolytic therapy is extensively used outside the United States. The appropriate role of mucolytic therapy in the treatment of bronchitis remains to be more fully explored. Low-flow oxygen is only used in the prevention or treatment of cor pulmonale when the PaO2 is persistently at or below 55, or with a rising hematocrit and right-sided cardiac changes. If used, oxygen is helpful only when given long term for at least 18 h per day, not on a prn basis. Cardiac glycosides are probably of little benefit, but diuretics have an important role in treatment of fluid retention. Pulmonary vasodilator therapy is still experimental, as is almitrine. Prophylaxis with pneumococcal vaccine and annual influenza vaccine is rational but has not been proven to be of value. Exercise and activity should be encouraged for all except those with frank congestive heart failure. The role of \"breathing exercises\" is currently being reevaluated. Surgery has almost no place in the management of COPD. Anesthesia often results in postoperative complications in this disease. Avoid all sedatives and tranquilizers.\r"

Probably 30 million Americans are afflicted with some stage of the disease. Assessment of COPD is based on symptoms and simple spirometric measurements that primary care physicians can perform in their offices. Early identification and intervention are vital to controlling COPD. Smoking cessation is most important. Aggressive pharmacologic therapy is also required. Bronchoactive drugs are more successful in improving airflow in patients in early stages of the disease than those with more advanced stages. The National Mucolytic Study Investigators' Meeting, focusing on the usage of iodinated glycerol (Organidin) in patients with moderate-to-advanced airflow obstruction from chronic bronchitis, has concluded that symptoms of the disease were improved in treated patients compared with patients receiving placebo. These results, based on a major double-blind, controlled clinical trial, will usher in a new approach to the treatment of patients with mucus clearance problems. It is now time to develop a nationwide strategy for involving all primary care physicians in the identification and treatment of patients with COPD.\r"

  ".W": "Medical views in the United States on the effects of smoking have shifted dramatically since the published evidence in 1958 established the link between smoking and fatal disease. Today's physician should be a nonsmoking role model, whose workplace both directly and indirectly teaches smoking cessation skills. Publications on smoking cessation techniques from the National Institutes of Health along with intervention tools such as patient smoking history questionnaires are available free of charge to physicians. Patient histories are critical to the intervention process, for they provide essential clues and information about which stage in cessation of smoking the patient has already reached: precontemplation, contemplation, action, and maintenance. Different approaches and techniques are required at each stage. The most important objective for the physician with a patient at the stage of contemplating quitting is to initiate a conversation leading to a directive to quit, with benefits of quitting stressed as reinforcement. Actively motivated patients committed to quit dates may need both educational and pharmacologic support; issues such as nicotine dependence and withdrawal symptoms must be addressed. Pharmacologic therapy at this time may consist of substitution of nicotine-containing gum (nicotine polacrilex) for cigarettes. Used in sufficient, regular dosages, the nicotine gum has been found to help diminish withdrawal symptoms following smoking cessation. Other drug therapies are currently under study. For now, nicotine replacement therapy (where indicated) is to be used for at least three months, the period of greatest chance of relapse. The physician should continue to encourage patients who have quit smoking to forestall relapses, while tacitly understanding that the incidence of relapse is high in first-time quitters. Hospital inpatients provide an opportunity to initiate bedside smoking cessation programs. The hope is that, in the future, hospitals will involve the entire health team in comprehensive smoking cessation programs.\r"

  ".W": "Classification of chronic airflow obstruction may be based on the site of the obstructing lesions. It is seldom that only one type of lesion is present, but one may often dominate. In chronic bronchitis, the major disease of large airways, chronic mucus hypersecretion, is reflected by an increase in size of bronchial mucous glands. This may be a factor in airway narrowing, especially with coexisting edema of the airway wall. Excess intralumenal mucus compounds the obstruction. Increased airways reactivity is present in 15 to 70 percent of patients with chronic airflow obstruction. Increased airway muscle and cartilage atrophy are features of chronic bronchitis, but the association of increased muscle with increased airway reactivity is poor. Inflammation of the small airways (bronchiolitis) is a significant complication for cigarette smokers and is an important cause of mild chronic airflow obstruction. Goblet cell metaplasia is a reflection of chronic small airways inflammation and, together with intralumenal mucus, is an important feature. Permanent narrowing of the small airways presumably results from inflammation with consequent fibrosis, while functional narrowing results from release of mediators of inflammation. Increased muscle mass is present in some cases. Distortion and irregularity of small airways related to emphysema are major factors in severe obstruction. Lesser degrees of emphysema may be associated with a diminished number of alveolar attachments and mild chronic airflow obstruction. Emphysema, the dominant lesion in patients with severe chronic airflow obstruction, results from parenchymal lesions. Centrilobular emphysema, in which the respiratory bronchioles are selectively or dominantly involved, is the most common form.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All measures of glycemic control improved significantly (P less than .001). Mean +/- SE glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) fell from 9.1 +/- 0.2 to 8.0 +/- 0.1%, glycosylated serum albumin (GSA) from 9.8 +/- 0.4 to 7.3 +/- 0.3%, and fructosamine from 3.92 +/- 0.08 to 3.42 +/- 0.07 mM. Fasting blood glucose levels fell from 11.1 +/- 0.6 to 8.1 +/- 0.7 mM mean blood glucose levels from 12.5 +/- 0.3 to 8.8 +/- 0.03 mM, and the M value from 118 +/- 7 to 40 +/- 3 U. Mean percentage changes in direct measures of glycemia (32-66%) and GSA (29%) were greater than for fructosamine (11%) or HbA, (12%) levels (P less than .001). Furthermore, the correlation between the change in GSA and changes in direct measures of glycemia over the initial 2-wk period was significantly different from the corresponding correlations between direct measures of glycemia and fructosamine over this period (P less than .05-.01). Changes in GSA also correlated more closely than HbA1 or fructosamine did with direct measures of glycemia after 4 and 6 wk. The Spearman rank-correlation coefficient (rs) of absolute changes in GSA, fructosamine, and HbA1 after 2-6 wk ranged from 0.27 to 0.57, confirming that the three measures responded differently to changing glycemic control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Compared with control subjects, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) subjects had both quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in blood insulin and glucose concentrations. The purpose of this study was to determine whether and to what extent normally observed multiphasic patterns of insulin and glucose responses to mixed meals are deranged in NIDDM. A total of 24 volunteers were studied while eating three meals of identical composition at 0745, 1145, and 1645. Twelve had NIDDM, and the remainder were healthy nondiabetic age- and weight-matched control subjects. Blood was withdrawn every 10 min from 0630 to 1930 for measurement of C-peptide, insulin, and glucose concentrations. Peaks were analyzed by computer-based algorithms. Diabetic volunteers displayed several differences from control subjects. First, although the number of insulin peaks was similar, there was a consistent delay of 20-30 min in the appearance of the first postprandial peak. Second, insulin concentrations after lunch were higher than after breakfast, whereas the reverse pattern occurred in control subjects. Third, integrated glycemia was greater after breakfast than after lunch. Fourth, glucose concentrations decreased during the first 30 min after lunch, suggesting accelerated glucose disposal and/or enhanced suppression of endogenous glucose production at this time of day. These data demonstrate that insulin secretion and action and glucose homeostasis in NIDDM are more complex than commonly appreciated. This dynamic state is undetected unless there is frequent blood sampling for measurement of insulin and glucose. The quantitative and qualitative abnormalities that we observed in these parameters are independent of obesity and suggest the need to expand the pathophysiological definition of NIDDM.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetes mellitus caused by pancreatic exocrine disease is a unique clinical and metabolic form of diabetes. The diagnosis of pancreatic diabetes caused by chronic pancreatitis may be elusive because it is occasionally painless and often not accompanied by clinical malabsorption until after hyperglycemia occurs. Diabetic patients with pancreatic calcification or clinically demonstrable pancreatic exocrine dysfunction will manifest the unique aspects of pancreatic diabetes described herein. Like other forms of diabetes, the primary hormonal abnormality in pancreatic diabetes is decreased insulin secretion. Patients with this disorder are unique in that they have low glucagon levels that respond abnormally to several physiological stimuli, blunted epinephrine responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and malabsorption. In addition, they often have concomitant alcohol abuse with hepatic disease and poor nutrition. These characteristics result in increased levels of circulating gluconeogenic amino acids, decreased insulin requirements, a resistance to ketosis, low cholesterol levels, an increased risk of hypoglycemia while on insulin therapy, and the clinical impression of brittle diabetes. Retinopathy occurs at a rate equal to that of insulin-dependent diabetes but may be less severe in degree. Other complications of pancreatic diabetes have been less well studied but may be expected to be seen more frequently as these patients survive longer. The characteristics of pancreatic diabetes suggest that a conservative approach be taken in regard to intensive insulin therapy and tight blood glucose control.\r"

  ".W": "We developed a computer program for the simulation of plasma insulin and glucose dynamics after subcutaneous injection of insulin. The program incorporates a pharmacokinetic model to calculate the time courses of plasma insulin for various combinations of popular preparations (regular, NPH, lente, and ultralente). With the use of a pharmacodynamic model describing the dependence of glucose dynamics on plasma insulin and glucose levels, the program can predict the expected time course of plasma glucose in response to a change in carbohydrate intake, insulin dose, timing, or regimen. A set of typical parameters has been obtained by analysis of data from the literature. The results of several computer simulations are presented showing the effect on a 24-h insulin and glucose profile of systematically changing insulin regimen, dose, timing of meals, or timing of preprandial insulin administration. The program can be used to explore on a theoretical basis the impact of various factors associated with glycemic control in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. As an educational tool, the program provides a realistic environment for demonstration of the combined or isolated effects of insulin and diet on glycemia.\r"

  ".W": "To examine whether a physical activity program could improve physical fitness and glycemic control, 32 children and adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) were examined before the program and 3 mo later. Fifty percent of the subjects (n = 16) participated in the training for 1 h/wk (exercise group), whereas the remaining subjects were engaged in nonphysical activities for an equal amount of time (nonexercise group). Age of the subjects ranged from 8.2 to 16.9 yr, (mean 11.9 yr), with mean duration of diabetes 0.6-13.1 yr (5.2 yr). During the 3-mo program peak oxygen consumption (VO2) rose from 40.0 to 43.8 ml.min-1.m-2 (P less than .01) in the exercise group but only by 1.3 ml.min-1.m-2 in the nonexercise group (NS). Metabolic control did not improve in either group, with glycosylated hemoglobin level rising from 9.8 to 10.5% (P less than .01) in the exercise group and from 9.4 to 9.7% (NS) in the control group. When subjects were stratified according to their participation, metabolic control was significantly better among diabetic subjects participating frequently (greater than or equal to 11 of 13 sessions) than among those participating infrequently (less than 11 of 13 sessions), regardless of the type of activity. It was concluded that a training program of 1 h/wk for 3 mo does improve physical fitness but not the metabolic control of diabetes. On the other hand, glycemic control appears to be best among diabetic subjects who are motivated to participate in any kind of program related to the treatment of their disease.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of metformin treatment on various aspects of carbohydrate and lipoprotein metabolism has been defined in 12 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Patients were studied before and after approximately 4 mo of metformin therapy. Treatment was initiated with a single dose of 500 mg/day, increased at weekly intervals, and maintained at a final dose of 2.5 g/day (given at divided intervals) for the last 3 mo of the treatment program. Results demonstrated that both fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations were significantly lower after metformin administration, with the greatest change seen after meals. As a result, the total incremental plasma glucose response above basal measured from 0800 to 1600 after metformin was less than 25% of that seen initially. The improvement in ambient plasma glucose concentration in association with metformin occurred despite a modest but statistically significant decrease in circulating plasma insulin concentration. In addition, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake measured during hyperinsulinemic clamp studies was similar before and after metformin treatment. Furthermore, changes in insulin binding and insulin internalization by isolated monocytes did not correlate with the improvement in glycemic control. Thus, the ability of metformin to lower plasma glucose concentration in NIDDM does not appear to be secondary to an improvement in insulin action. Finally, metformin treatment was associated with a significant (P less than 0.01) decrease in plasma triglyceride concentration and an increase in plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. These results indicate that metformin treatment of patients with NIDDM led to an improvement in both glycemic control and lipoprotein metabolism.\r"

The glycosylated hemoglobin, duration of diabetes, current age, diastolic blood pressure, number of past pregnancies, and current pregnancy status were evaluated as risk factors for progression of diabetic retinopathy. After adjusting for glycosylated hemoglobin, current pregnancy was significantly associated with progression (P less than 0.005, adjusted odds ratio 2.3). Diastolic blood pressure had a lesser effect on the probability of progression. The findings from this study indicate that pregnancy and level of glycemia are associated with progression of diabetic retinopathy.\r"

At the 5-yr examination, 56 of the diabetic patients (36 men, 20 women) were on diet therapy only, 60 (27 men, 33 women) received oral antidiabetic drugs, and 5 were treated with insulin. The metabolic control of diabetic patients was poor at the time of diagnosis and 5-yr examination. Fasting plasma insulin levels were higher in diabetic patients than in control subjects both at baseline (23 +/- 2 vs. 14 +/- 1 mU/L, P less than 0.01, for men; 26 +/- 2 vs. 15 +/- 1 mU/L, NS, for women) and 5-yr examination (19 +/- 1 vs. 16 +/- 2 mU/L, NS, for men; 29 +/- 5 vs. 15 +/- 1 mU/L, P less than 0.05, for women). The frequency of insulin deficiency in diabetic patients based on a postglucagon (1 mg i.v.) C-peptide level less than 0.60 nM was 3.3% at the 5-yr examination, indicating that true insulin deficiency was uncommon during the first years after diagnosis of diabetes in middle-aged subjects.\r"

  ".W": "This review summarizes aspects of the phenotypic expression, natural history, recognition, pathogenesis, and heterogeneous nature of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), which is inherited in an autosomal-dominant pattern. There are differences in metabolic, hormonal, and vascular abnormalities in different ethnic groups and even among White pedigrees. In MODY patients with low insulin responses, there are delayed and decreased insulin and C-peptide secretory responses to glucose from childhood or adolescence even before glucose intolerance appears, which may represent the basic genetic defect. When followed for decades, nondiabetic siblings have normal insulin responses. The fasting hyperglycemia of some MODY patients has been treated successfully with sulfonylureas for up to 30 yr. In a few patients, after years or decades of diabetes, the insulin and C-peptide responses to glucose are so low that they resemble those of early insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The progression of the insulin secretory defect over time distinguishes between these two types of diabetes. In contrast are patients from families who have very high insulin responses to glucose, despite glucose intolerance and fasting hyperglycemia similar to that seen in patients with low insulin responses. In many of these patients, there is in vivo and in vitro evidence of insulin resistance. Whatever its mechanism, the compensatory insulin responses to nutrients must be insufficient to maintain normal carbohydrate tolerance. This suggests that diabetes occurs only in those patients who have an additional islet cell defect, i.e., insufficient beta-cell reserve and secretory capacity. In a few MODY pedigrees with high insulin responses to glucose and lack of evidence of insulin resistance, a structurally abnormal mutant insulin molecule that is biologically ineffective is secreted. No associations have been found between specific HLA antigens and MODY in White, Black, and Asian pedigrees. Linkage studies of the insulin gene, insulin-receptor gene, erythrocyte/HepG2 glucose-transporter locus, and apolipoprotein B locus have shown no association with MODY. Vascular disease may be as prevalent as in conventional non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Because of autosomal-dominant transmission and penetrance at a young age, MODY is a good model for further investigations of etiologic and pathogenetic factors in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, including the use of genetic linkage strategies to identify diabetogenic genes.\r"

As previously reported, in diabetic patients on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, users of insulin-containing m-cresol had significantly more inflamed infusion sites than users of insulin with methyl p-hydroxybenzoate. This study assessed the influence of insulin with and without these preservatives on leukocyte function. Leukocyte function was investigated in a killing experiment, expressed as the percentage of bacteria killed after 60 min incubation of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus), polymorphonuclear leukocytes, serum, and insulin preparations. Because preservative is retained by the infusion device, insulin with preservative was tested before and after 1 and 4 days perfusion with a PVC pump catheter. After perfusion, the amount of preservative was reduced (percentage of original concentration after 1 and 4 days 8 and 30% m-cresol and 42 and 72% methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, respectively). The killing percentage in insulin with m-cresol reduced compared with insulin without preservative (mean +/- SE 95.4 +/- 0.8%) and the control without insulin (95.8 +/- 0.8%), both before and after 1 and 4 days perfusion (74.8 +/- 0.7, 80.2 +/- 2.8, and 80.6 +/- 1.6%, respectively; P less than 0.01).

All insulin preparations with m-cresol caused lower killing percentages than corresponding insulin preparations with methyl p-hydroxybenzoate (P less than 0.05). These results demonstrate that both preservatives impaired leukocyte function, but m-cresol was the most noxious in this respect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both subcutaneous and intramuscular absorption rates were measured four times in each patient. NPH insulin was absorbed much faster when given intramuscularly than when given subcutaneously (T50% = 5.3 vs. 10.3 h, P less than 0.0001). The intrapatient (day-to-day) coefficient of variation (C.V.) of T50% values (C.V. T50%) for subcutaneously injected NPH insulin in this study, where all injections were guided by ultrasound determination of the subcutaneous fat layer, was 18.4%. Intrapatient variation of absorption was significantly lower for subcutaneously than intramuscularly injected NPH insulin (C.V. T50% = 18.4 vs. 29.8%, P less than 0.01) and was also lower than interpatient variation for subcutaneously injected insulin (C.V. T50% = 18.4 vs. 50%, P less than 0.0001). The faster absorption rate and shorter duration of action, together with the higher day-to-day variation in absorption, led us to conclude that intramuscular injection of NPH insulin should be avoided.\r"

In vivo total-body insulin-mediated glucose metabolism was evaluated by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Physical fitness was assessed by maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) during cycle ergometry. Patients and control subjects had similar levels of VO2 max (34.9 +/- 8.6 vs. 38.6 +/- 9.9 ml.kg-1.min-1, P = 0.3). Patients had lower total-body insulin-mediated glucose metabolism compared with control subjects (33.9 +/- 14.3 vs. 63.8 +/- 17.2 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P = 0.0002). Among the patients, females had lower total-body insulin-mediated glucose metabolism compared with males (24.2 +/- 2.8 vs. 40.7 +/- 3.4 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.001); however, this difference disappeared after correcting for sex differences in fitness levels. Insulin-mediated glucose metabolism correlated with VO2 max in patients and control subjects (r = 0.83, r = 0.81, P less than 0.05). The regression of total-body insulin-mediated glucose metabolism on VO2 max for patients was -2.84 +/- 0.255 VO2 max and for control subjects was 7.12 +/- 0.143 VO2 max, indicating that for similar degrees of physical fitness patients have lower total body insulin-mediated glucose metabolism levels than control subjects. In patients, total-body insulin-mediated glucose metabolism correlated with the degree of glycemic control as assessed by the level of glycosylated hemoglobin (r = -0.63, P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The recent isolation of vasopressin (VP) from the rat and human pancreas led us to investigate the effects of VP on insulin secretion. In the SV 40-transformed hamster beta cell line (HIT), 0.1-1.0 nM VP caused rapid stimulation of insulin secretion. Slight but significant inhibition of insulin secretion was observed in the presence of 10 pM VP. These effects of VP on insulin secretion were paralleled by dose-dependent changes in inositol phosphate (IP) production, indicating mediation by V1-type VP receptors. VP stimulated IP3 production at 30 sec and production of IP1 by 60 sec. VP (0.1 nM to 1 microM) failed to stimulate the release or cellular content of cAMP, whereas forskolin was an effective stimulus. Forskolin and VP together caused at least additive stimulation of insulin secretion. Taken together, these observations indicate that VP is not acting via V2-mediated pathways. However, VP-induced stimulation of insulin and IP production were only slightly inhibited by a V1a pressor antagonist in 100- or 1,000-fold excess, indicating that VP effects are not mediated by V1a receptors. The V1 receptor involved may represent a V1b or a novel type of VP receptor. These observations suggest a potential physiological role of VP in regulating insulin secretion.\r"

In the present study, we examined the effect of gonadectomy and hormone replacement on the processing of pro-GnRH to GnRH in adult male rats. Immunoreactive levels of pro-GnRH and GnRH in acid extracts of preoptic area (POA) and basal hypothalamus (BH) from intact, castrate, and testosterone (T)-treated castrate males were quantified by RIA. In addition, we used immunocytochemistry to detect pro-GnRH-and GnRH-positive neurons and determine the effects of hormone treatment. Three weeks after castration, the pro-GnRH content of the POA was 2-fold greater than the amount found in intact males. Treatment with T for 1 week lowered the prohormone content to intact levels. Although the pro-GnRH content in the BH was about 50% lower than that in the POA, the BH responded to castration and steroid replacement in a manner identical to the POA. The GnRH content of the BH, but not that of the POA, was significantly reduced after castration and increased by T treatment. On the other hand, the total number of pro-GnRH and GnRH cell bodies visualized by immunocytochemistry was not significantly altered by either treatment. These results show that changes in pro-GnRH content vary in inverse relation to changes in GnRH content and suggest that gonadectomy inhibits the enzymatic processing of precursor, while T treatment promotes it.\r"

We have performed pulse-chase experiments to investigate the individual patterns of release of these two molecular variants. The cells were pulse labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine and then chased for increasing periods of time up to 24 h. The secretion of newly synthesized G- and NG-hPRL was followed by immunoprecipitation of the chase medium and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Both forms were rapidly released (10 min of chase), but presented with different rates of secretion. Half-maximal release of G-hPRL occurred with 60-min chase, while 110 min were necessary for NG-hPRL. More than 50% of initially labeled G-hPRL was released in the medium vs. only 20% for NG-hPRL. Incubation of the cells with 8-chloroadenosine-cAMP during a 2-h chase period resulted in a 3.6-fold increase in the release of newly synthesized NG-hPRL and had only a slight effect on newly synthesized G-hPRL release (1.7-fold increase). The intracellular transit of labeled G- and NG-hPRL was investigated in cells treated by the ionophore monensin. The secretions of both newly synthesized forms were inhibited to the same extent, probably via an arrest of the transit at the level of the median Golgi, as judged by the delay of acquisition to endoglycosidase-H resistance for G-hPRL in monensin-treated cells. In contrast, Western blot analysis of the same medium-showed that monensin abolished the secretion of G-hPRL and had little effect on NG-hPRL. Our results on the different rates of secretion of G- and NG-hPRL indicate a sorting of the two forms into different compartments in the secretory pathway, with G-hPRL being secreted at a higher rate than NG-hPRL, possibly via a different intracellular route. The differential effects of 8Cl-cAMP and monensin further suggest that G-hPRL may be constitutively secreted after synthesis, while NG-hPRL secretion may involve a storage step.\r"

  ".U": "90126557\r", 
  ".W": "In alloxan-diabetic (A-D) dogs, plasma glucagon does not increase when glycemia is decreased by insulin. Therefore, as in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), increased glucose utilization is not matched by an increase in hepatic production. To explore further the abnormal effects of insulin on regulation of pancreatic glucagon, we studied content and morphology of pancreatic hormones in six normal (N) dogs, five hyperglycemic A-D (HD) dogs, and in four A-D dogs where normoglycemia was maintained by insulin (ND). Morphometric measurement of islets and of immunocytochemically localized A cells (glucagon) were performed by an image analysis system. In normal pancreas, islets of tail and body were bigger in size (tail = 4850 +/- 376 microns 2, body = 3256 +/- 198 microns 2), than the head (2009 +/- 207 microns 2). Glucagon content was 331 +/- 50 micrograms with a mean concentration of 8.5 +/- 0.9 micrograms/g in N dogs, and did not change in HD dogs (422 +/- 34 micrograms, 9.3 +/- 0.4 micrograms/g). With normoglycemia, glucagon content decreased by 5-fold (p less than 0.001). Morphometry indicated that, although A cell area per islet increased (2.7-fold), islet number decreased (70%), explaining the unchanged glucagon content in HD dogs. This decrease in islet number can also justify the dramatic glucagon decrease in ND dogs. Despite the 70% decrease in islet numbers in HD dogs, pancreatic somatostatin increased 3-fold (9.93 +/- 3.3 to 30.6 +/- 7.2 micrograms), indicating that its islet content was augmented 10-fold. Somatostatin content returned to normal with normoglycemia. Pancreatic insulin content in HD dogs was negligible (55 +/- 23 micrograms) when compared with that in N dogs (5500 micrograms) and it did not increase with normoglycemia. The distinct but markedly diminished insulin and proinsulin peaks in HD dogs nearly disappeared in ND dogs. Thus, in alloxan-diabetic HD dogs, 70% of islets are destroyed. A marked increase in glucagon in residual islets can explain the unchanged islet size despite the absence of B cells; however, the percent increase of somatostatin is larger than that of glucagon. Normoglycemia 1) normalizes somatostatin content, 2) further diminishes insulin and proinsulin synthesis presumably due to lack of hyperglycemic stimulus, and 3) paradoxically decreases pancreatic glucagon content 5-fold below its normal level. We hypothesize that with normalization of plasma insulin, glucagon content in each islet normalizes, but because of destruction of most islets, pancreatic glucagon content becomes extremely low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In our previous study, we raised a polyclonal antiserum against a synthetic 15 amino acid peptide encoding the putative hormone binding domain of c-erb A, which not only inhibited T3-binding to rat liver nuclear T3 receptor (NT3R) but also immunoprecipitated [125I]T3-NT3R complex. In the present study, interactions between this antiserum (4 BII-immunoglobulin G (IgG] and NT3R were further characterized. 4BII-IgG interefered T3 from binding to rat liver NT3R both in the nuclear extract and in isolated nuclei in a similar manner. Preincubation with 4BII-IgG decreased the association constant value with no effect on maximal binding capacity of NT3R. Lineweaver-Burk plot revealed competitive inhibition of T3-NT3R binding. Both the inhibition of T3 binding and immunoprecipitation of NT3R by the antiserum were similarly observed with rat liver, kidney, brain, and testis, and human kidney nuclear extract. Since the polypeptide sequence which was used for immunization is highly homologous between c-erb A alpha 1 and beta, it is likely that 4BII-IgG recognizes both c-erb A alpha 1 and beta in various tissues. On the contrary, 4BII-IgG did not interfere with T3 binding to rat liver cytosol T3-binding protein and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) prepared from human serum, nor immunoprecipitated these binding proteins labeled with [125I]T3. The binding protein for reverse T3 (NrT3BP) in the rat liver nuclear extract was neither immunoprecipitated nor influenced in its rT3-binding activity by 4BII-IgG. When the immune complex between the nuclear extract and 4BII-IgG was removed by antirabbit IgG goat serum, the remaining T3-binding activity was reduced by 87%, while no rT3-binding activity was immunodepleted, suggesting that NrT3BP is a protein different from NT3R. The data show that the antiserum against c-erb A peptide recognizes NT3R specifically with no distinction between difference in tissues and species. Carboxyl-terminal region of c-erb A/NT3R is critical for T3-binding.\r"

  ".W": "Immunohistochemical analysis of avidin and ovalbumin expression in the normally developing chick oviduct was compared to those changes induced by exogenous estrogen. Oviduct maturation was found to occur in two consecutive phases: slow proliferation and rapid differentiation. Mitosis was induced in the epithelium by estrogen, whereas it was inhibited by progesterone. Endogenous progesterone may retard the proliferation and prevent the differentiation, an effect that is overridden by increased estrogen concentration at the beginning of differentiation. Short secondary stimulation was shown to closely mimic normal maturation. When chicks treated with diethylstilbestrol (DES) for 1 month were allowed to mature, there were marked alterations in oviduct histology and laying behavior. The tubular glands were found to form from the surface epithelium as budlike invaginations, and these cells also contained avidin and ovalbumin. Ovalbumin production was stable in tubular glands. In contrast, the intensity of avidin staining was variable between gland cells even in the same sections. It was conspicuous that the number of avidin-expressing gland cells diminished markedly when estrogen treatment was prolonged over 1 week. After 2-week stimulation with DES, avidin was expressed predominantly by cells of the basal layer of pseudostratified surface epithelium, and ovalbumin mainly by tubular glands and cells of the luminal layer of surface epithelium. Neither of these proteins was expressed by goblet cells. Expression of progesterone receptor, characterized by two antibodies (polyclonal IgG-RB and monoclonal PR6), did not explain the heterogeneity of expression of avidin and ovalbumin, but probably reflects various differentiation stages of epithelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "Adipose precursor cells from male rats were exposed in primary culture to testosterone (T) or dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and their effects on the regulation of lipolysis were studied. T, but not DHT, stimulated catecholamine-induced lipolysis in a dose-dependent manner, including physiological concentrations. The effect was equally pronounced with isoproterenol (a pure beta-adrenergic agonist) and norepinephrine (a mixed alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic agonist). The higher lipolytic capacity of catecholamines on T-treated cells was paralleled by a similar increase in the number of beta-adrenoceptors in the cells, without a change in the receptor affinity, suggesting that T induced new synthesis or externalization of beta-adrenoceptors. Both T and DHT stimulated forskolin-induced lipolysis, suggesting an androgen effect at the level of the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase. The pertussis toxin-stimulated lipolysis was not influenced by the presence of androgens in the culture medium, and no effect was seen on the antilipolytic effect of insulin. These effects did not disappear in the presence of an aromatase inhibitor, suggesting that the T effects were not mediated by conversion to estrogens. These cells showed specific saturable binding for androgens, with a Kd in the range of androgen concentrations shown to be active. In conclusion, androgens enhance the lipolytic capacity of these cells by increasing the apparent number of beta-adrenoceptors (T only) and the activity of adenylate cyclase (both T and DHT). These changes are not mediated by conversion to estrogens. These effects probably occur via binding to specific androgen receptors.\r"

Immunoreactivity for the type II enzyme was seen in A cells, and no apparent immunoreactivity for type I was observed in the islet cells. The expression of the type III protein kinase C in B cells was confirmed using rat insulinoma cells. The predominant expression of the type III enzyme in these cells was shown by immunoblotting. Moreover, on the basis of an enzyme-linked sandwich immunoassay, the levels of protein kinase C isozymes were determined in these cells. The significant amounts of the type III enzyme was detected, but the contents of the type I and II enzyme were under detectable level. These results suggest that the type III protein kinase C is involved in the regulation of insulin release in pancreatic B cells.\r"

Diabetes-resistant (DR) BB rats have phenotypically normal immune systems and rarely become spontaneously hyperglycemic, but can be rendered diabetic by in vivo immune elimination of T cells that express the RT6 surface alloantigen. To determine if humoral factors in these animals influence beta-cell function, we studied the effect of BB rat plasma on glucose-induced insulin secretion from the isolated perfused rat pancreas. We found that plasma dialyzed to remove molecules less than 14 kD from nondiabetic DR and DP BB rats significantly enhanced total insulin secretion [4806 +/- 711 ng (+/- SEM; n = 6) and 4968 +/- 1235 ng (n = 7), respectively] from perfused pancreata when compared with the effects of either plasma from Wistar-Furth rats (2585 +/- 336 ng; n = 9) or medium containing no plasma (1862 +/- 92 ng; n = 38). The presence of chemically induced diabetes was also associated with enhanced insulin secretion [3276 +/- 414 ng (n = 8) using alloxan and 3956 +/- 470 ng (n = 7) using streptozocin], but the greatest degree of enhancement was observed with plasma from spontaneously diabetic BB rats (6521 +/- 751 ng; n = 17). The enhancement of insulin secretion by BB rat plasma, both diabetic and nondiabetic (DR and DP), was characterized by preservation of first and second phase hormone release. Heat inactivation of acutely diabetic BB rat plasma did not affect its ability to stimulate insulin secretion. We conclude that the plasma of BB rats, both before and after the onset of autoimmune diabetes mellitus, contains a factor other than complement of greater than or equal to 14 kD that enhances insulin secretion in vitro from the isolated perfused pancreas.\r"

The osteotropic hormones 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, PTH, and calcitonin had no effect on TNF production. The TNF released by the osteoblasts was identified as TNF alpha, using a specific anti-TNF alpha monoclonal antibody to neutralize its activity. Immunohistochemical staining of the cells using the same antibody revealed that all of the cells in the cultures were capable of producing TNF alpha, including those that also expressed alkaline phosphatase activity. Immunoreactive protein could be detected in the perinuclear region when cells were cultured in the presence of monensin, suggesting accumulation of newly synthesised protein in the Golgi apparatus. These results suggest that human osteoblasts, which have been shown previously to respond to TNF alpha, can synthesize and release TNF in response to IL1 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. TNF may, therefore, not only have a pathological role in conditions of chronic inflammation, but also may act as a local paracrine or autocrine regulator of osteoblast function.\r"

  ".U": "90126581\r", 
  ".W": "Recently it has been postulated that interleukin-1 (IL-1) locally released by infiltrating mononuclear cells may destroy the pancreatic B cells during the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Since IL-1 is a potent inducer of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in various cells, it is conceivable that IL-6 is a second mediator of the IL-1 action. In the present study the effects of IL-6 alone or in combination with IL-1 were studied on pancreatic islet function in vitro after tissue culture and compared with the effects observed after exposure to IL-1 only. Rat pancreatic islets were cultured in medium RPMI 1640 + 10% calf serum with or without the addition of human recombinant IL-6 (500-5000 pg/ml) for 48 h. The medium insulin accumulation was increased by 40-50% after culture with 500-2000 pg/ml IL-6, but was similar to the controls at 5000 pg/ml. When islets were cultured for 18 h only, also 5000 pg/ml IL-6 stimulated the medium insulin accumulation. IL-6 did not affect the islet insulin content and the rates of islet (pro)insulin and total protein biosynthesis. It inconsistently decreased the islet DNA content. In short-term experiments after 48-h culture with IL-6, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of the glucose-stimulated insulin release. On the other hand, islets cultured with IL-6 (5000 pg/ml) exhibited an elevated glucose oxidation and oxygen uptake, but a lower ATP content at 16.7 mM glucose and an unaffected glucose utilization and glutamine oxidation compared to the controls. This raises the possibility that IL-6 had induced a condition with an increased energy expenditure, resulting in an enhanced mitochondrial metabolism of glucose. Islets cultured with human recombinant IL-1 beta (25 units/ml) showed a strong inhibition of the insulin accumulation in the culture medium and of glucose-stimulated insulin release and a marked decrease in the islet DNA and insulin content. A combination of IL-1 (25 U/ml) + IL-6 (1000 pg/ml) did not alter the inhibitory action of IL-1 alone. The present findings thus show that IL-6 induces a dissociation between insulin secretion and glucose oxidation in islets in vitro. This has not been observed in islets exposed to IL-1, which suggests that IL-6 does not solely mediate the inhibitory effects of IL-1 on islet function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "GnRH neurons form the final common pathway regulating the secretion of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary. Since the patterns of gonadotropin release display profound sexual dimorphism among mammals including the rodent, we undertook an ultrastructural analysis to determine whether these neurosecretory cells were differentially innervated between the sexes. As a further exploration of the organization of the neurocircuitry integrating GnRH neurons with the central nervous system, we also determined the degree to which GnRH cells and their processes were innervated by terminals containing either the endogenous opiate, beta-endorphin (BE) or GnRH itself. Sections from the diagonal band of Broca and the preoptic area of adult male and diestrus II female rats were immunocytochemically processed for dual localization of GnRH and BE. GnRH neurons cut through the plane of the nucleus were identified in 1 micron sections. Serial ultrathin sections were made and analyzed for 1) total synaptic input to both cell bodies and dendrites; 2) BE input; and 3) input arising from GnRH itself. We report that GnRH neuronal cell bodies in females received approximately twice the number of synapses as did those of males. The input to the GnRH dendrites, when measured as percent of plasma membrane in synaptic contact, also showed a profound sexual dimorphism with the female having a larger proportion of the dendrite in synaptic apposition. BE innervation contributed to this dimorphism at the level of both the cell body and dendrite. In contrast, the distribution and number of GnRH terminals did not differ between the sexes. In both they were confined to the dendritic arbor. We hypothesize that the capacity of the female rodent GnRH system to show neurogenic derived alterations in GnRH output not seen in the male may be due in part to these anatomical differences.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were undertaken to determine the mechanism(s) by which TSH and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) act synergistically to stimulate DNA synthesis in FRTL-5 cells. As observed in previous studies, the response of these cells to a combination of TSH plus IGFs (or micromolar concentrations of insulin) greatly surpass the sum of the effects of the individual hormones when acting alone. Part of this synergism was eliminated when media containing TSH and IGF-I were replaced every 4 h with fresh media. This suggested that part of the synergism between TSH and IGF-I on cell proliferation is mediated by an amplification factor(s) (AF) released from FRTL-5 cells during incubation. The AF was not specific for thyroid cells, however, since conditioned medium from TSH treated FRTL-5 cells was also found to potentiate the mitogenic effect of IGF-I in the human fibroblast cell line GM3652. It is unlikely that the AF activity secreted by these cells in response to TSH is either IGF or an IGF-binding protein, since the anti-IGF monoclonal antibody sm 1.2 did not attenuate the synergism between TSH and high concentrations of insulin on thymidine incorporation. Analysis of thymidine incorporation into DNA at different times after different patterns of exposure to TSH, IGF-I, or TSH plus IGF-I suggested that at least part of the synergism between the two hormones resulted from increasing the number of quiescent cells recruited into the cell cycle. These results suggested that the TSH-dependent AF might be acting as a competence factor. In a preliminary screen of candidate growth factors, only fibroblast growth factor (FGF) simulated the effect of AF, and its effect was smaller than that obtained with TSH-treated FRTL-5 cells. After preincubation with TSH, FRTL-5 cells exhibited greatly increased responsivity to the mitogenic effects of IGF-I that was manifested by both increased sensitivity to IGF-I, as judged by a decreased EC50, and an increase in their maximum response. TSH pretreatment, likewise, amplified subsequent DNA synthesis in response to serum and tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate. Thus, the mitogenic effect of TSH in FRTL-5 cells is due not only its stimulation of IGF production, but also to its stimulation of one or more AF that greatly enhance the responsivity of these cells to mitogenic stimuli.\r"

It has been shown that interleukin-1 (IL-1) mediates the CRF-induced secretion of beta-endorphin by lymphocytes in vitro. In the present report it is demonstrated that sc administration of CRF to rats can also induced beta-endorphin secretion by lymphocytes from spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. Moreover, this CRF-induced secretion of beta-endorphin coincides with enhanced secretion of IL-1 by macrophages. Previously, we reported that IL-1 can activate CRF neurons in the hypothalamus of the brain. Our data indicate the existence of an intricate relationship between CRF and IL-1, peptides that can be viewed as playing a pivotal role in the interaction between the central nervous system and the immune system.\r"

Moreover, the hypothalamic content of NPY can be modulated by peripheral hetabolic status. To further evaluate the regulation of NPY synthesis in states of altered metabolic homeostasis, we measured the hypothalamic content of prepro-NPY mRNA in streptozocin (STZ)-diabetic, STZ-diabetic insulin-replaced, and control rats by both nuclease protection and in situ hybridization analyses. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received a single injection of STZ (100 mg/kg, ip) or citric acid (control). Beginning 72 h later one group of STZ-treated animals received daily injections of insulin (4 U Ultralente/day). All animals were killed 17-19 days after STZ or control treatment. STZ-treated animals were hyperglycernic and showed growth failure compared to control rats. Glycemic control was restored by insulin replacement, as was partial growth. Nuclease protection analysis revealed an approximately 3- to 4-fold increase in prepro-NPY mRNA levels in the samples from STZ-treated rats vs. control. This increase was returned to control values by insulin replacement. In situ hybridization analysis revealed the STZ-induced increase in hypothalamic prepro-NPY mRNA was detectable in the arcuate nucleus at levels that were in agreement with the nuclease protection results, but that NPY expression in other brain regions appeared to be either unaffected or decreased after STZ treatment. These data suggest that hypothalamic NPY expression is modulated by peripheral metabolic status and provide further explanation for the hyperphagia accompanying STZ-induced diabetes.\r"

  ".U": "90126610\r", 
  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that a decrease in hypothalamic inhibitory opioid tone produced by naloxone (NAL) will activate neuropeptide-Y (NPY) neurosecretion in 17 beta-estradiol (E2)-primed ovariectomized (ovx) rats. NPY neurosecretion was assessed in two ways. First, we studied the effects of iv saline (controls) or NAL infusion (2 mg/h) between 1100-1400 h on NPY concentrations in seven microdissected sites in the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) and preoptic area in association with the increase in the rate of LH secretion, and then we examined the effects of NAL on the in vitro release of NPY and LHRH from the MBH of E2-primed ovx rats. We observed that in control rats, NPY concentrations in selected hypothalmic sites (median eminence, medial preoptic area, and arcuate nucleus) increased either just before LH rise at 1400 h or in association with the moderate LH surge in the afternoon. NAL infusion advanced the onset and amplified the magnitude of LH surge in the afternoon. In association with this augmentation of LH response, NAL infusion significantly increased NPY concentrations selectively in the median eminence, medial preoptic area, and arcuate nucleus. During NAL infusion at 1300 h and at the end of infusion at 1400 h, NPY concentrations in these sites increased compared to preinfusion levels at 1100 h and corresponding control levels at 1300 h. During the post-NAL infusion period until 1800 h, NPY levels remained elevated in these sites, but were not significantly different from those in control rats, which also displayed increments at this time. Further, NAL increased the in vitro efflux of both NPY and LHRH from the MBH; the increased release of two neuropeptides was dose related between 0.01-0.5 mg/ml, with the maximal increase occurring at 1.0 mg/ml NAL. Cumulatively, these studies show that 1) in association with the spontaneous LH surge in E2-primed rats, NPY concentration increased only in sites confined to the preoptic-tuberal pathway, which previously has been shown to mediate the induction of the LH surge; and 2) a decrease in the inhibitory opioid tone imposed by NAL readily augmented the hypothalamic NPY neurosecretion concomitant with an increase in duration and magnitude of the LH surge. These findings are in accord with the thesis that a decrease in the inhibitory opioid tone by the neural clock, postulated to occur before the LH surge, initiates a chain of neurosecretory events that may include a site-specific activation of NPYergic neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Aging of the female reproductive system in rats is marked by discrete stages in the disappearance of regular estrous cyclicity. We determined at which point in the transition to acyclicity changes in the LH pulse generator could be detected by comparing pulsatile LH release in ovariectomized young rats to three groups of middle-aged rats that were chronologically matched, yet exhibited different stages of reproductive senescence. Since changes in LH pulse amplitudes can result from hypothalamic and/or pituitary factors, we also assessed pituitary responsiveness to exogenous GnRH. Young rats (2-3.5 months) that had shown regular 4- or 5-day estrous cycles and middle-aged rats (9.5-12 months) that exhibited either regular cycles, irregular cycles, or persistent estrus were bilaterally ovariectomized and used 4 weeks later. Rats were implanted with right atrial cannulae and were bled 2 days later at 5-min intervals for 3 h. To test pituitary responsiveness to GnRH, rats were bled at 10-min intervals for 3 h and received GnRH (25 ng/100 g BW, iv) after the first and second hours. The mean inter-peak interval increased in middle-aged irregularly cycling and persistent estrous rats. The frequency distribution of inter-peak intervals was already significantly different in middle-aged regularly cycling compared to that in young regularly cycling rats. Middle-aged rats displayed fewer short inter-peak intervals and a greater frequency of longer intervals between LH pulses. LH pulse duration increased gradually in parallel with increasing reproductive senescence. Pulse amplitude decreased in all groups of middle-aged rats regardless of their prior reproductive status. Mean LH concentrations were significantly lower in middle-aged than in young regularly cycling rats, and a further significant decline was detected in the middle-aged irregularly cycling and persistent estrous groups. Middle-aged regularly and irregularly cycling rats showed decreased pituitary responsiveness to GnRH compared to young regularly cycling rats, whereas middle-aged persistent estrous rats displayed an intermediate level of pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. These data are the first evidence of changing pulse generator function in middle-aged rats tha had previously exhibited no change in the regularity of their estrous cycles. We suggest that such changes may play a role in the age-related transition to acyclicity.\r"

  ".U": "90126612\r", 
  ".W": "Estrogen (E) is well known to be an important stimulator of progesterone receptor (PR) synthesis in target cells. We have observed that E stimulation of PR in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (as monitored by progestin binding or Western blotting with anti-PR antibodies) increases as a function of serum concentration in the cell culture medium; PR stimulation by E is greatest in high serum medium (5% or 10% charcoal dextran-treated calf serum) and is not observed when cells are in medium containing serum concentrations below 1%, although estrogen receptor levels are well maintained. This suggests that some serum factor(s) may be essential for E to be able to stimulate PR. To better understand such factors, we have grown cells in serum-free medium and in serum-free medium supplemented with insulin (6.25 micrograms/ml) [corrected], transferrin (6.25 micrograms/ml), selenium (6.25 ng/ml), albumin (1.25 mg/ml) [corrected], and linoleic acid (5.35 micrograms/ml; ITS+). Unexpectedly, we found that addition of ITS+ (without E) increases PR levels in these cells, especially in the absence of serum and under low serum conditions where E stimulation of PR is poor. Analyses of the individual components in ITS+ reveal that insulin is the major active component. Dose-response studies indicate that high superphysiological (greater than 1 microgram/ml) concentrations of insulin are required. In contrast, low physiological levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I; 10 or 40 ng/ml) are active, suggesting mediation by the IGF type I receptor system. At all serum concentrations (0-10%), the effects of ITS+ and E in increasing PR are synergistic. The fact that anti-E are able to suppress the insulin/IGF-I stimulation as well as the E stimulation of PR suggests that the anti-E can actively interfere with the action of the growth factor as well as the action of E. These results indicate that regulation of PR is multifactor and raise the possibility that PR may be regulated in vivo by both E and growth factors such as IGF-I that are known to be increased in these breast cancer cells by E.\r"

Transiently high levels of receptor immunoreactivity were found in the developing brain, particularly in the cortex and hypothalamus. The amount of receptor immunostaining in these areas decreases toward the time of birth, and levels are approximately equivalent to those in the adult by postnatal day 7. The choroid plexus, cerebral vasculature, ependymal cells, retina, and pituitary contain high levels of receptor immunoreactivity throughout embryogenesis and adulthood. Some mesodermally derived tissues, such as bone, also demonstrate transient expression of IGF-II receptor during fetal development. These data are consistent with potential roles for IGF-II in CNS development, in the development of specific mesodermal tissues, and in specific regions of the postnatal CNS.\r"

  ".W": "Human alpha-thrombin is known to elicit bone resorption in vitro and has been proposed as a mediator of increased bone turnover in inflammatory diseases. We used UMR 106-H5 rat osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells to explore the signal transduction mechanism utilized by thrombin in bone. Thrombin produced a dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates (IPs) in UMR 106-H5 cells prelabeled with [3H]myo-inositol (EC50 15 U/ml). In saponin-permeabilized cells, GTP gamma S increased [3H]IP production, whereas GDP beta S inhibited the response to both GTP gamma S and thrombin, indicating involvement of a G-protein in thrombin action. Thrombin produced a dose-dependent increase in intracellular free calcium (Cai2+) in UMR 106-H5 cells (EC50 1 U/ml; maximal increase 4-fold), as well as a small (20%) increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation. Treatment of UMR 106-H5 membranes with pertussis toxin (PT) and [32P]NAD+ resulted in labeling of a 40-kDa protein. However, pretreatment of cells with a dose of PT sufficient to produce maximal endogenous labeling of this protein failed to influence thrombin action on IP accumulation, Cai2+, or [3H]thymidine incorporation. In contrast, PT treatment of CCL39 hamster lung fibroblasts significantly blunted thrombin-stimulated [3H]IP accumulation and [3H]thymidine incorporation. These results suggest that thrombin raises Cai2+ in UMR 106-H5 cells by activating polyphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C. Whereas in fibroblasts and platelets, thrombin receptors appear to couple to both PT-sensitive and PT-insensitive G-proteins, only a PT-insensitive G-protein appears to mediate thrombin action in UMR 106-H5 cells. Either these cells lack the relevant PT-sensitive G-protein or they possess thrombin receptors that selectively couple to a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein.\r"

  ".U": "90126624\r", 
  ".W": "Water soluble peptides are normally not transported through the brain capillary wall, i.e. the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Chimeric peptides may be transportable through the BBB and are formed by the covalent coupling of a nontransportable peptide, e.g. beta-endorphin, to a transportable peptide vector, e.g. cationized albumin, using disulfide-based coupling reagents such as N-succinimidyl 3-[2-pyridyldithio(propionate)] (SPDP). The transcytosis of peptide into brain parenchyma, as opposed to vascular sequestration of blood-borne peptide, was quantified using an internal carotid artery perfusion/capillary depletion method. It is shown that [125I]beta-endorphin is not transported through the BBB, but is rapidly cleaved to free [125I] tyrosine via capillary peptidase. Therefore, chimeric peptide was prepared using [125I] [D-Ala2]beta-endorphin (DABE), owing to the resistance of this analogue to peptidase degradation. The [125I] DABE-cationized albumin chimeric peptide is shown to enter brain parenchyma at a rate comparable to that reported previously for unconjugated cationized albumin. When the [125I] DABE-cationized albumin chimeric peptide was incubated with rat brain homogenate at 37 C, the free [125I] DABE was liberated from the cationized albumin conjugate prior to its subsequent degradation into free [125I] tyrosine. Approximately 50% of the chimeric peptide was cleaved within 60 sec of incubation at 37 C. These studies demonstrate that 1) [125I]beta-endorphin is not transported through the BBB in its unconjugated form, 2) a [125I] DABE-cationized albumin chimeric peptide is transported through the BBB into brain parenchyma at a rate comparable to the unconjugated cationized albumin, and 3) brain contains the necessary disulfide reductases for rapid cleavage of the chimeric peptide into free beta-endorphin and this cleavage occurs before degradation of the [125I] DABE into [125I] tyrosine.\r"

  ".W": "The requirement to obtain a semen sample at a specific time for an infertility treatment procedure has potential to produce considerable performance anxiety. This study was designed to evaluate the semen quality of men participating in infertility treatments associated with heightened performance anxiety. The most recent pretreatment semen analysis and the infertility treatment semen analysis, as well as the first and last procedure semen analyses, were compared using paired t-tests for 77 patients undergoing assisted reproductive technology procedures and 121 patients undergoing intrauterine insemination. No significant differences were noted in either of these groups of patients. However, in men with total motile sperm counts of less than 40 million, semen parameters improved significantly in the procedure semen analyses. Thus, participation in infertility treatments associated with performance anxiety does not appear to be detrimental to semen quality, and in certain groups of patients semen quality may improve.\r"

A systematic planning process produces measurable outcomes, timetables to evaluate results, and assignments for individual responsibility. Strategic planning is discussed as it occurred during a year-long planning process in a family medicine department. Through the use of an external consultant and through the efforts of the department's division directors, a set of plans were written and approved for the residency program, clinical services, predoctoral education, geriatric education, research and development section, and the administration of the department. The consultation and strategic planning procedure produced a candid analysis of the department's strengths and growth needs, and specified the contributions that will be needed by all faculty to achieve the organization's goals.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to correlate colonic motility and transit in patients with constipation and symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome. Studies were performed in 16 patients with constipation and compared with the results in 12 healthy subjects. Intraluminal pressure was measured with perfused catheter ports in the transverse colon, splenic flexure, and descending and sigmoid colon. Movement of the luminal contents was measured by following the movement of Technetium-99m-DTPA that was instilled as a bolus in the splenic flexure. In both healthy subjects and patients with constipation there was no movement of the intraluminal tracer and no increase in intraluminal pressure during fasting. After eating a meal, healthy subjects and one group of the constipated patients had an increase in the radioactive marker in the transverse colon (p less than 0.03) and in the sigmoid colon (p less than 0.03). The movement of the intraluminal contents was associated with a positive pressure gradient between the descending colon and the transverse and sigmoid colon. There was no retrograde movement of the intraluminal contents and no postprandial increase in intraluminal pressure in the second group of patients with constipation. In healthy subjects, propagating contractions, which were associated with the rapid movement of intraluminal contents, began 60 min after eating. There were no propagating contractions in patients with constipation. These studies suggest that (a) the movement of intraluminal contents in healthy and constipated patients is determined by the postprandial pressure gradients within the colon, and (b) the propagating contraction is necessary for a normal bowel habit.\r"

Mice that developed acute colitis showed signs of diarrhea, gross rectal bleeding, and weight loss within 6-10 days after ingesting 3%-10% dextran sulfate sodium. On postmortem examination, multiple erosions and inflammatory changes including crypt abscesses were found on the left side of the large intestine. Mice that developed chronic colitis showed signs of erosions, prominent regenerations of the colonic mucosa including dysplasia, shortening of the large intestine, and frequent formation of lymphoid follicles after 5 administration cycles, where each cycle was composed of 7 days' consumption of drinking water containing 5% dextran sulfate sodium followed by 10 days' consumption of distilled water. The population of intestinal microflora, Bacteroides distasonis and Clostridium spp., increased significantly in mice with acute and chronic ulcerative colitis. Further, morphological studies suggest that the administered dextran sulfate sodium was partially phagocytized by macrophages in the colonic mucosa.\r"

  ".U": "90128054\r", 
  ".W": "In 19 patients, extraction of bile duct stones through the papilla using a Dormia basket or a mechanical lithotripter was not possible following endoscopic sphincterotomy. After the insertion of a nasobiliary drain, extracorporeal lithotripsy was performed with intravenous sedation using an ultrasonographic stone localization system. The number and location of stones were first determined by retrograde cholangiography. At the time of lithotripsy, saline was injected in the bile ducts to modify the acoustic impedance of tissues surrounding the stones, and subsequent ultrasonography was effective in localizing all stones present in 4 of 5 (80%) patients with intrahepatic stones, and 13 of 14 (93%) with common bile duct stones. In 10 patients (53%), fragmentation was satisfactory and the bile ducts were cleared completely. The mean single stone diameter was significantly smaller in successful cases of fragmentation compared with failures (22.8 +/- 6.6 mm vs. 40 +/- 10 mm). The results in patients with multiple stones were significantly worse than those in patients with single stones of similar size (25% vs. 100% successful fragmentation). Reasons for this difference in results included the small size of the focal area and the reduced ability of ultrasonography (1) to adequately visualize multiple calculi individually and (2) to assess the degree of stone destruction. Care was taken to first await the resolution of infection or the correction of coagulation abnormalities when present; no morbidity following extracorporeal lithotripsy was observed. Despite its 3-step approach (endoscopic sphincterotomy, lithotripsy, and endoscopic extraction), the need for only intravenous sedation and the absence of patient immersion in water render this technique attractive for elderly and frail patients.\r"

The dumping reaction was not detectably altered by the addition of guar to the meal. Plasma VIP concentration rose and plasma volume fell to a similar degree in 'dumpers' and 'non-dumpers', suggesting that neither event is an integral component of the dumping mechanism. In contrast, the rates of rise of blood glucose and enteroglucagon concentration were markedly greater in 'dumpers'. The results are inconsistent with the conventional explanation that the early dumping syndrome is caused by a large osmotic fluid shift, but are compatible with a mechanism involving an initial period of intestinal hypermotility.\r"

Five animals underwent coeliac ganglionectomy and up to seven control animals were studied. Coeliac ganglionectomy increased four-fold the pancreatic fluid response to secretin. The early part of the fluid response to 2-deoxyglucose was reduced, but there was no effect on the protein response to 2-deoxyglucose. In controls, ethanol 0.56 g/kg stimulated pancreatic secretion, to nearly double the basal level, but after coeliac ganglionectomy this dose of ethanol inhibited secretion to one third of basal values. There was no effect of coeliac ganglionectomy on pancreatic response to ethanol 1 g/kg. After coeliac ganglionectomy the early response to a meal was increased by 100% for fluid output and by 50% for protein secretion, but from 10 minutes to two hours after the meal there was no effect on pancreatic response. These data shed further light on the mode of action of ethanol on pancreatic secretion, and they indicate that therapeutic coeliac ganglia ablation in man is unlikely to be detrimental to physiological pancreatic secretion.\r"

As this cover story details, outpatient oncology is becoming a priority program for many hospitals, at the same time that inadequate inpatient reimbursement, patient preference, and new therapies and technologies are quickly shifting the bulk of cancer patients to the outpatient setting. Moreover, significant changes in outpatient payment policies are in the offing.\r"

  ".W": "We used the technique of high-performance liquid chromatography combined with radioimmunoassay to establish the profile of angiotensin peptides in the periphery and across the circulation of the dog's heart. Data were obtained before and after blockade of angiotensin converting enzyme, and after acute myocardial ischemia produced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Baseline values of plasma renin activity and immunoreactive angiotensin II were higher in the aortic root than in the coronary sinus but concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin-(1-7) were similar. In untreated animals, coronary occlusion produced significant increases in renin activity and arterial and venous levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin II. Inhibition of converting enzyme with benazeprilat (CGS-14,831) increased baseline circulating levels of angiotensin I, whereas angiotensin II and its carboxyl terminal fragments were reduced markedly. Baseline plasma levels of angiotensin-(1-7) and its fragments did not change. Myocardial ischemia in benazeprilat-treated dogs increased plasma renin activity and circulating levels of angiotensin I. Concentrations of angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) did not change either in peripheral blood or across the coronary circulation. These results indicate that angiotensin peptides can be formed endogenously by enzymatic pathways alternate to converting enzyme. Furthermore, these data provide the basis for a further understanding of the role of the renin-angiotensin system after myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "New findings from this laboratory suggest that fragments of angiotensin derived from the amino (N-)terminus are biologically active end products of the renin-angiotensin system. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that the heptapeptide angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] is a major endogenous product of the renin-angiotensin system cascade in the brains of rats and dogs. Additional studies with enzyme inhibitors showed that Ang-(1-7) is produced directly from angiotensin I by an enzyme other than the angiotensin converting enzyme. Immunocytochemical fibers within the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal vasopressinergic system of the rat. Although Ang-(1-7) is as potent as angiotensin II (Ang II) in stimulating release of vasopressin from superperfused hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal explants, the heptapeptide has no dipsogenic or vasoconstrictor activity. In contrast, Ang-(1-7) mimics the effects of Ang II in augmenting the intrinsic discharge rate of neurons within the vagal-solitary complex and in causing monophasic depressor responses after microinjection into the medial region of the nucleus tractus solitarii. The evidence obtained in these experiments suggests novel mechanisms for the generation of angiotensin peptides in the brain. Additionally, the findings suggest that some of the biological actions ascribed to Ang II might be conveyed by the endogenous production of other angiotensin peptides that are generated by enzymatic pathways alternate to those described in the peripheral circulation.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to investigate the role played by renal functional and structural changes in the development of radiation-induced hypertension. Four groups of rats were studied: 1) left kidney radiated, 2) sham procedure, 3) uninephrectomy followed 3 weeks later by radiation of the contralateral kidney, and 4) uninephrectomy followed by sham procedure 3 weeks later. All radiated rats became hypertensive at 12 weeks (p less than 0.05) and had higher protein excretion (p less than 0.05). In the presence of an intact contralateral kidney, radiation causes mild-to-moderate histological abnormalities, and therefore, creatinine clearance and water and sodium handling do not change. Plasma renin activity increased in this group (p less than 0.05). Radiated uninephrectomized rats showed decreased creatinine clearance (p less than 0.05), but renin activity remained unchanged. These rats developed severe histological abnormalities in glomeruli, interstitia, tubuli, and vessels resulting in increased sodium and water output. The average of individual tubular and interstitial scores correlated significantly with both water intake and output but not with sodium excretion. These studies suggest that in the presence of an intact kidney, renin is an important determinant in the development or maintenance of radiation hypertension, whereas in the absence of the contralateral kidney, severe histological changes and renal failure are prominent despite increased water intake and output. The more severe glomerular sclerosis and proteinuria in the latter model could be related to diminished renal mass.\r"

We also observed that those weanling DS rats with the greatest pressor response to a high salt diet eventually developed cataracts, and that changes in salt intake modified cataract formation. In the present studies, we measured lens 86Rb uptake as an index of sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase [(Na+,K+)-ATPase] activity in weanling DS rats before the development of cataracts or sustained hypertension. Additionally, plasma renin activity was measured to indirectly assess our hypothesis that the difference between cataract-prone DS rats and DS rats unlikely to develop cataracts might be a difference in degree of salt sensitivity. At the age of 4 weeks, 50 DS and 25 salt-resistant (DR) rats were given a high sodium diet for 2 weeks, at which time the rats were divided into three groups based on the systolic blood pressure response, that is, cataract-prone DS rats with systolic blood pressure equal to or greater than 155 mm Hg, DS rats unlikely to develop cataracts with systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 125 mm Hg, and DR rats. Lens and aqueous humor Na+ and K+, lens dry weight, and water content were not significantly different among the three groups of weanling rats. Plasma renin activity was lowest in cataract-prone DS rats and low in DS rats unlikely to develop cataracts when compared with values in DR rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of intrarenal infusions of calcium gluconate (10 and 100 micrograms Ca/kg/min) on renin secretion were studied in anesthetized mongrel dogs. In one group, the two doses of calcium were infused for 30 minutes each (1 ml/min). In a second group, the same doses were administered 30 minutes after the start of infusion of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors (indomethacin 10 micrograms/kg/min intrarenal or injection of meclofenamate 5 mg/kg i.v. bolus). Mean arterial pressure, renal blood flow, and glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged during the infusion of calcium in both groups. The infusion of 10 micrograms Ca/kg/min increased renin secretion 77% and sodium excretion 123%. During the infusion of 100 micrograms Ca/kg/min, renin secretion was not different from precalcium values, whereas urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, urine flow, sodium, potassium, and calcium excretion rates were increased (p less than 0.05). During the administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, the urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels were reduced, and the infusion of 10 micrograms Ca/kg/min failed to increase renin secretion, sodium excretion, or 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion rates. The infusion of 100 micrograms Ca/kg/min during prostaglandin synthesis inhibition did not modify urine flow or sodium excretion; however, potassium and calcium excretions increased. It is concluded that 1) the intrarenal infusion of small doses of calcium gluconate is capable of stimulating renin secretion through a prostaglandin-mediated mechanism, and 2) the stimulation of renin secretion as well as the increase in sodium excretion induced by calcium are independent of hemodynamic alterations.\r"

  ".W": "The participation of the central serotonergic system in the development of two-kidney, two clip (2K2C) Goldblatt renovascular hypertension in the rat has been examined. Half of the rats were treated with desmethylimipramine intraperitoneally and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine intracisternally; the other half received only desmethylimipramine and the 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine vehicle. Two days later, a silver clip was placed in both renal arteries in half of the rats of each group. A sham operation was performed in the remaining rats. Blood pressure was recorded during the 5 weeks after treatment. At the end of the experiment, blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples were obtained. The brain was dissected into several areas and kept frozen. Norepinephrine, serotonin, angiotensinogen, and renin-like concentration were evaluated in the brain areas. Plasma renin activity and angiotensinogen concentration in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid were estimated. In the sham-operated groups, blood pressure was lower in the treated than in the control rats. The curve of blood pressure increase, as well as the final blood pressure, was similar in the treated and control 2K2C rats. Serotonin was significantly depleted by the 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine treatment in all brain areas. Treatment did not induce any changes in central norepinephrine concentration. Plasma renin activity was diminished in the treated sham-operated rats. These data indicate that the central serotonin depletion does not prevent the development of hypertension and confirm the role of the amine in normal blood pressure regulation. On the other hand, the peripheral renin-angiotensin system might participate in the development of high blood pressure in serotonin-depleted animals.\r"

In population studies, blood pressure has been found to be a continuously distributed risk variable with mortality directly related to the level of blood pressure. Thus, hypertension is both a disease and a risk factor. Classic genetic studies suggest that the predisposition for the development of hypertension is an inherited trait that becomes manifest when coupled with one or more environmental insults. Risk factors for hypertension include age, weight, sedentary lifestyle, excessive dietary sodium intake, and excessive alcohol intake. Current and future research is being directed toward the identification of predictors of hypertension that can be conceptualized according to demographic, clinical, genetic, challenge-response, and laboratory predictors. The intent is to identify subjects with a high probability for the development of hypertension in advance of the rise in blood pressure so that appropriate interventions can be implemented as early as possible.\r"

Short-term research objectives center around enhancing methods for detection, evaluation, treatment, and control of high blood pressure because, even in the absence of precise knowledge of the etiology of hypertension, its control results in substantial reductions in morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a multifaceted national research strategy has been developed that includes basic science, applied research, clinical research, clinical trials, and demonstration and education research approaches. Complementing this research strategy is a congressionally mandated program to facilitate the application of the products of research to the clinical care setting by promoting educational activities aimed at health care providers, patients, and consumers.\r"

The increase in cat terminal ileum tonus was antagonized by a bradykinin receptor antagonist, L-349b. Treatment of the animals with indomethacin blocked or reversed the hypotensive effect of captopril without affecting the increase in tonus of the cat terminal ileum. Captopril potentiated the hypotension induced by bradykinin injected intra-arterially, and indomethacin reduced the hypotensive effect of intra-arterially injected bradykinin. Addition of captopril or enalapril to the superfusing blood maintained at 37 degrees C in an extracorporeal circuit caused a long-lasting increase in the tonus of the cat terminal ileum. The present results support the hypothesis that immediate hypotension induced by captopril involves a prostaglandin-dependent component possibly resulting from increased bradykinin levels generated in the vicinity of captopril action.\r"

Both antihypertensive medications were infused at a maximal dose increment of 0.2 microgram/kg/min (fenoldopam) and 1 microgram/kg/min (nitroprusside), with a maximal infusion rate of 1.5 micrograms/kg/min fenoldopam mesylate or 8 micrograms/kg/min sodium nitroprusside. Once the desired reduction in diastolic blood pressure was achieved (less than 110 mm Hg if initial diastolic blood pressure was 120-149 mm Hg, or by at least 40 mm Hg if initial diastolic blood pressure was 150-190 mm Hg), the maximal infusion rate used was maintained for at least 1 hour, and then, the infusion was slowed gradually over 2 hours. After the infusion treatment, patients remained in the hospital for 2 days of follow-up. Both antihypertensive agents successfully controlled the blood pressure in all the patients by the end of the maintenance periods. Between the baseline and the end of the maintenance period, analysis of variance showed that the changes in the variables induced by fenoldopam mesylate did not differ significantly from those induced by sodium nitroprusside. The incidence of side effects listed were similar in both groups of patients. The detection of toxic levels of thiocyanate in two patients treated with nitroprusside, however, shows that fenoldopam might be preferable for the control of a hypertensive crisis or severe hypertension in patients with decreased renal function.\r"

In one protocol, hemorrhage produced a complete resetting to hypotension in rats chronically treated (6 days) with captopril. Also, hemorrhage produced only partial resetting in rats acutely treated (10-15 minutes before baroreceptor recording) with captopril and in control (untreated) rats (73 +/- 7% and 49 +/- 5%, respectively). In another protocol, all vasodilators produced hypotension in normotensive rats. Nifedipine produced complete (93 +/- 4%) resetting to hypotension, whereas prazosin produced near-maximal (83 +/- 3%) resetting. The remaining drugs studied (phenoxybenzamine, trimethaphan, and MgSO4) induced a partial resetting (63 +/- 7%, 63 +/- 9%, and 50 +/- 5%, respectively) that did not differ significantly from the extent observed with hemorrhage in control (untreated) rats. These results demonstrate that different antihypertensive drugs distinctly modulate rapid baroreceptor resetting to hypotensive levels and that nifedipine and long-term treatment with captopril associated with hemorrhage modulate rapid resetting to hypotension in a more efficient manner.\r"

Median effective concentrations and maximal responses to endothelin did not differ in aortas with endothelium isolated from GII, DOCA-salt hypertensive, and control rats. After removal of the endothelium, the potentiation of the aorta responses to endothelin was of the same magnitude in hypertensive and control rats. A closed-circuit television system was used to observe the microvascular bed of the exteriorized mesentery of anesthetized GII, DOCA-salt hypertensive, and control rats. The time necessary to induce a vasoconstrictor response was determined after the topical application of endothelin. Vessel diameters at rest and after endothelin application were also estimated. At the microcirculatory level, a greater reactivity to endothelin was observed in both hypertensive rat groups, whereas higher sensitivity to endothelin was recorded in the GII hypertensive microvessel preparations alone. It is suggested that the increased response to endothelin observed in hypertensive rats might be due to abnormal sensitivity or reactivity of the microvessels of these rats reflecting an alteration of the contractile sequence possibly at the plasma membrane level, or due to both. Endothelial dysfunction at the microcirculatory level, however, cannot be dismissed.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro removal of anti-A and anti-B antibodies by immunoadsorbents with synthetic oligosaccharide structures representing blood group substances have been studied under controlled and simulated extracorporeal perfusion conditions at different flow rates ranging from 20 to 160 mL/min. There is a gradual decline in antibody titers in the plasma, as it relates to the antibody binding capacity and efficiency of the immunoadsorbents, both as a function of time and plasma volume at any of the flow rates employed. Approximately the same maximal binding capacity is achieved in about 4 hours of perfusion regardless of the flow rate, whereas increased number of plasma volumes are required at higher flow rates to compensate for the appropriate residence times needed in the column to utilize the same capacity. The perfusion time alone appears to be a critical factor which via the flow rate determines the residence time between the plasma and the immobilized hapten in the column. Also, the optimal flow rate at which maximum binding capacity of the immunoadsorbent may be utilized efficiently appears to fall within a range of the flow rate. The factors determining this range and the efficiency of the immunoadsorbents under dynamic conditions are discussed. The results obtained under the controlled conditions and the discussions that follow are expected to be generally useful, at least, as approximate clinical guidelines, for selective removal of specific substances by extracorporeal perfusion techniques utilizing therapeutic intervention with immunoadsorbents in this important area of medical therapy.\r"

After a 4 week run-in period, patients were randomly allocated to nimodipine or placebo for 12 weeks (parallel groups). There were 7 drop-outs, 3 on Nimodipine, and 4 on placebo. A gradual and very marked improvement was seen both with Nimodipine and placebo amounting to between 60 and 90 per cent during the last 4 weeks. Statistical analysis on all included patients (intention to treat) revealed no difference between Nimodipine and placebo for migraine days or migraine index. In patients \"valid for analysis of efficacy\" there were also no significant difference. Due to a very marked placebo effect and use of the parallel groups design, the present trial is relatively weak despite a fairly large sample size. It cannot rule out the possibility of an important effect of Nimodipine in classic migraine with a high degree of certainty.\r"

In other words, the ratio between the chronic and the remitting stage as of today is 67:17 = 3.94. Accordingly, there seems to be a reverse relationship of the chronic versus the remitting stage, when compared to cluster headache. A maximum attack frequency even of 5-6 attacks per 24 hours seems to be consistent with a diagnosis of CPH. Nocturnal attacks occurred in 55 out of 58 cases where such information was available.

We discuss these practices, along with the factors and organisms responsible for nosocomial infection in the patient undergoing mechanical ventilation. Despite traditional infection control measures, nosocomial infection continues to be a major problem. In recent years evidence has accumulated that points to bacterial colonization of the oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract as a major source of infection. A new technique, selective decontamination of the digestive tract, is being studied extensively for its ability to control colonization of the oral cavity and the gastrointestinal tract. In the technique nonabsorbable topical antibiotics are applied to the oropharynx and instilled into the stomach, and a short course of an intravenous cephalosporin is included. The technique appears a worthwhile addition to traditional infection control measures.\r"

To investigate the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in HA, we studied 10 women [mean age, 29 +/- 7 (+/- SD) yr] with 0.5-13 yr of amenorrhea (mean, 4.3 +/- 3.7 yr) related to simple weight loss or psychological stress. We investigated cortisol and ACTH responses to a bolus of ovine CRH, 24-h plasma cortisol levels obtained every 10 min, and urinary free cortisol levels in these patients. Results were compared with those obtained in normal women during all phases of the menstrual cycle. We found that mean basal concentrations of cortisol were significantly higher (P = 0.03) in the HA patients (mean, 210 +/- 130 nmol/L) than in the normal women (100 +/- 30 nmol/L). The delta (peak - basal) cortisol was significantly lower (P = 0.004) in the HA patients than in the normal women (320 +/- 100 vs. 440 +/- 90 nmol/L, respectively). ACTH responses to CRH did not differ between HA patients and normal women. The 24-h mean cortisol was significantly higher (P = 0.006) in the HA patients than in the normal controls (280 +/- 50 and 220 +/- 50 nmol/L, respectively), due to higher cortisol levels at night. The urinary free cortisol level was significantly higher (P = 0.005) in the HA patients (230 +/- 70 nmol/day) than in normal women (150 +/- 40 nmol/day). We conclude that women with HA have a blunted cortisol response to CRH administration. In addition, they have hypercortisolism, as demonstrated by elevated 24-h mean serum cortisol levels and urinary free cortisol values. This hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation in patients with stress or weight loss may be a mechanism in the development of amenorrhea and may relate to other potential adverse effects of HA.\r"

We also examined the gene expression of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II), a mitogen for rat pheochromocytoma cells exerted by autocrine or paracrine fashion. All samples from the pheochromocytomas contained IGF-II transcripts as well as c-fos and c-myc transcripts.

Histological features consistent with SAT were not demonstrable, and various forms of CT (fibrous variant, diffuse, or focal lymphocytic thyroiditis) were observed. There were no differences in mean age, duration of symptoms, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein values in the 2 diseases. Seven patients had a history of goiter, and none had a history of a preceding upper respiratory tract infection. The mean white blood cell count was significantly lower in CT than in SAT patients. Six CT patients had transient thyrotoxicosis with a marked depression of radioactive iodine uptake. Mean serum T4 and T3 levels and T3 to T4 ratio in these 6 patients did not differ from those in the SAT patients. Five (all with high antimicrosomal antibody titers) of 8 CT patients developed persistent hypothyroidism. In contrast, none of the SAT patients became permanently hypothyroid. TSH binding inhibitory immunoglobulins and thyroid stimulation-blocking antibody at recent examination were negative in these 5 patients. Patients with this disorder present with transient thyrotoxicosis, with a marked depression of the thyroid radioactive iodine uptake, and often develop goitrous or atropic persistent hypothyroidism. This disorder may represent acute exacerbation of an underlying immunological process during the course of CT. To differentiate this syndrome from SAT, thyroid biopsy is necessary.\r"

In 9 of these individuals there was no insulin replacement, whereas in the other 9 individuals enough insulin was infused to restore the insulin concentration to the basal level. Measurements were made of plasma glucose, insulin, G, and FFA concentrations as well as hepatic glucose production (Ra). The results indicated that plasma FFA concentrations were significantly lower when G was infused (S greater than S + G) regardless of whether insulin was infused. However, similar elevations of the plasma G concentration did lead to higher values of Ra and plasma glucose, although the basal concentration of plasma insulin decreased the increases in Ra and plasma glucose caused by G. The ability of a similar amount of insulin to lower plasma FFA concentrations was greater in magnitude than the decrease in Ra. These data indicate that G does not increase plasma FFA concentrations in normal individual, and that insulin plays a role of greater magnitude in suppression of plasma FFA concentrations than in inhibition of Ra.\r"

The proliferation of these cells is assessed by the in situ labeling of endometrial sections for Ki67 (a proliferation marker) as well as in vitro incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; a thymidine analog) into S-phase cells in vibratome sections of endometria. Using the avidin-biotinperoxidase complex method, sections of endometria and vibratome sections of endometria are labeled for Ki67 and BrdU, respectively. Subsequently, they are immunostained for CD45 (a lymphoid cell marker), CD3 (a T cell marker), and CD11c (a macrophage marker) molecules. Lymphoid cells scattered or aggregated in the endometrial stroma as well as intraglandular lymphoid cells exhibit Ki67 positivity throughout the menstrual cycle. The proliferative activity of the lymphoid cells, including the CD45, CD3, and CD11c positive cells scattered in the stroma, is markedly increased in the secretory phase. Similar, however less conspicuous, increased Ki67 labeling is observed in the lymphoid cells within lymphoid aggregates. The increased proliferative activity of the lymphoid cells in the secretory phase is confirmed by BrdU labeling in the vibratome sections. In the proliferative phase the non-CD45-positive cells in the endometrial stroma exhibit low proliferative activity, and in the secretory phase, Ki67 labeling in the endometrial stroma is primarily confined to the CD45-positive cells. The findings suggest that in situ proliferation is one mechanism by which the endometrial lymphoid cell pool within endometrium is restored after each menstrual shedding.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence has suggested that pancreatic islets isolated from rats synthesize 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (DAG) de novo from glucose and that this process may constitute the long-sought link between the metabolism of glucose and the induction of insulin secretion. The cell-permeant diacylglycerol 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (200 microM) has been found here to amplify both the first and second phases of insulin secretion from perifused human islets. Measurements of the mass of endogenous DAG in human pancreatic islets by enzymatic and by mass spectrometric methods indicate that levels of 200 microM may be achieved under physiologic conditions. Conversion of [14C]glucose to [14C]DAG has been demonstrated here to occur within 60 s of exposure of rat and human islets to stimulatory concentrations of glucose. This process has been found to be a quantitatively minor contributor to the total islet DAG mass after acute stimulation with glucose, however, and glucose has been found not to induce a rise in total islet DAG content within 20 min of induction of insulin secretion. In contrast to the case with rodent islets, two pharmacologic inhibitors of DAG-induced activation of protein kinase C (staurosporine and sphingosine) have been found not to influence glucose-induced insulin secretion from isolated human islets. These findings indicate that de novo synthesis of DAG from glucose does not participate in acute signal-response coupling in islets.\r"

Conditioned medium from the human fibroblast cultures enhanced neutrophil survival in a dose-dependent fashion to the same level achieved with neutrophil/fibroblast co-cultures, and its soluble viability-sustaining activity was not inhibited by preincubation with neutralizing antiserum against rh GM-CSF. As compared with freshly isolated replicate samples, neutrophils co-cultured with human fibroblasts for 72 h exhibited augmented FMLP-stimulated superoxide production without spontaneous superoxide generation. This striking extension of survival and associated priming for a ligand response by neutrophils co-cultured with human fibroblasts suggests that fibroblasts may contribute to the proinflammatory properties of neutrophils in tissues.\r"

A yeast microflora persisted in many patients despite the routine prophylactic use of oral antifungal agents. Analysis of the yeast species isolated on a cross sectional basis showed that C albicans accounted for 65% of yeasts isolated from the oral cavity but only 45% of the faecal yeast flora. Longitudinal changes in yeast flora occurred significantly more often in faecal samples than in oral samples and significantly less often in sites colonised with C albicans than in sites colonised with other species. No associations were found between the yeasts isolated and the nature of antifungal prophylaxis used, or the extent of a patient's stay in hospital.\r"

The subjects then used one of three treatment regimens, were retested for accumulated plaque and regraded. The three treatments tested were a commercial prebrushing mouthrinse and no toothbrushing; a commercial prebrushing mouthrinse and brushing with a dentifrice for 30 seconds; a prebrushing water rinse and brushing with a dentifrice for 30 seconds. The analysis of the data found that both groups that brushed removed significantly more plaque than the group that did not brush. However, both the prebrushing rinse group and the water rinse group achieved the same amount of plaque removal through 30 seconds of toothbrushing with a dentifrice.\r"

  ".U": "90131473\r", 
  ".W": "The clinical utility of exercise thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography was investigated in 360 consecutive patients who had concomitant coronary arteriography. Tomographic images were assessed visually and from computer-quantified polar maps. Sensitivity for detecting coronary artery disease was comparably high using quantitative and visual analysis, although specificity tended to improve using the former method (87% versus 76%, p = 0.09). Quantitative analysis was superior to the visual method for identifying left anterior descending (81% versus 68%, p less than 0.05) and circumflex coronary artery (77% versus 60%, p less than 0.05) stenoses and detected most patients (92%) with multivessel coronary artery disease. Multivessel involvement was correctly predicted in 65% of the patients with more than one critically stenosed vessel. Exercise variables in patients with significant coronary artery disease were similar whether the tomographic images were normal or abnormal. However, patients with coronary stenoses and normal versus abnormal tomograms had a trend toward more single vessel disease (79% versus 62%, p = 0.07) and moderate coronary stenosis (66% versus 28%, p less than 0.001), but had less proximal left anterior descending artery involvement (8% versus 34%, p = 0.05). Computer-quantified perfusion defect size was directly related to the extent of coronary artery disease. Intra- and interobserver agreement for quantifying defects were excellent (r = 0.98 and 0.97, respectively). In conclusion, quantitative thallium-201 tomography offers improved detection of coronary artery disease, localization of the anatomic site of coronary stenosis, prediction of multivessel involvement and accurate determination of perfusion defect size, while maintaining a high specificity. Quantification of perfusion defects with single photon tomography may become important for assessing the effects of coronary reperfusion and prognostically stratifying patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "In one third of patients requiring permanent cardiac pacing, sinoatrial response to exercise is inadequate. This has led to the development of a number of nonatrial sensors capable of increasing stimulation rate in response to metabolic demand. Initial sensor-modulated pacemakers were designed for use in the ventricle. This review was undertaken to compare ventricular rate-adaptive pacing with dual chamber and nonrate-adaptive atrial modes. Rate-adaptive ventricular pacing is primarily indicated in patients with complete heart block and nonfunctional atria in whom increased rates are not associated with the development of myocardial ischemia or retrograde conduction. A responsive atrium remains the best measure of metabolic demand, and devices capable of maintaining atrioventricular (AV) sequencing provide superior hemodynamic performance at usual activity levels. In addition, preserved AV relations reduce the incidence of new atrial fibrillation and stroke. Newer devices combining the advantages of atrial and nonatrial rate modulation with the preservation of AV synchrony will best utilize the developing sensor technologies.\r"

One patient had a pneumothorax, and three had a right ventricular perforation. Ventricular tachycardia developed in four patients; it was treated with lidocaine in three and was self-limited in one. The procedure was unsuccessful in two patients. Among 25 patients with a prebiopsy diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, microscopic features were consistent with cardiomyopathy in 24 (96%) and were normal in 1. Of nine patients with clinically suspected myocarditis, only two (22%) had microscopic evidence of inflammation, and seven had chronic nonspecific features suggestive of dilated cardiomyopathy. Of eight patients with unexplained arrhythmias, six (75%) had microscopic findings compatible with dilated cardiomyopathy and two had myocarditis. Biopsy tissue samples from seven patients with nondilated forms of cardiomyopathy (four hypertrophic, three restrictive) were consistent with the clinical diagnosis in six and were inadequate in one. Cardiac biopsies were also performed in four patients with other disorders. Among the 51 patients with adequate biopsy specimens, microscopic features were considered diagnostic in 5, confirmatory in 44 and not helpful in 2 with normal tissue. The results indicate that endomyocardial biopsy is safe in infants, children and adolescents. It is useful for the evaluation of cardiomyopathy and specific secondary forms of myocardial disease. There seems to be little correlation, however, between clinical and tissue diagnoses of myocarditis.\r"

Ten patients with stable asthma (eight men and two women), aged 17 to 48 years, were challenged with the same dose of allergen (Dermatophagoides pteronissinus, Parietaria, and grass mix) that had induced an FEV1 fall of at least 20% in a preliminary study on two occasions: immediately after placebo and furosemide (approximately 28 mg) administered by inhalation in random order and double-blind. Furosemide did not demonstrate any direct bronchodilator effect but markedly attenuated allergen-induced bronchoconstriction. The mean (95% confidence interval) maximum fall in FEV1 was 31.5% (40.2% to 22.8%) after placebo and 8.4% (11.8% to 4.9%) after furosemide administration. Furosemide, administered by aerosol to anesthetized guinea pigs actively sensitized to ovalbumin, dose dependently protected the animals from anaphylactic reaction. Infusion of furosemide (10 mg/kg for 10 minutes) failed to protect the animals from the anaphylactic response. In nonsensitized guinea pigs, the cardiovascular and pulmonary changes induced by histamine (10 micrograms/kg intravenously [i.v.]), leukotriene C4 (1 micrograms/kg i.v.), and platelet-activating factor (0.1 microgram/kg i.v.) were not modified by aerosol administration of furosemide (10 mg/ml for 10 minutes). In conclusion, inhaled furosemide induces a clear-cut protection against immediate obstructive reaction caused by areoallergerns and ovalbumin, both in subjects with asthma and actively sensitized guinea pigs, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Airway reactivity and disease severity were investigated in 24 subjects with stable chronic bronchial asthma. Disease severity was determined by assigning a disease severity score (DSS) representing six clinical and therapeutic parameters. Airway hyperresponsiveness was assessed in two ways: airway reactivity score (ARS) based on the number of positive responses to a question concerning exposure to 22 nonspecific inhaled irritants and methacholine challenge testing and determining the cumulative dose causing a 20% reduction in FEV2 (CMD20). A significant correlation between DDS and CMD20 (r = 0.57; p less than 0.003) and DSS and ARS (r = 0.67; p less than 0.0003) attested to the important influence of airway hyperresponsiveness on disease severity. Significant correlations for ARS with CMD20 (r = -0.60; p less than 0.002) suggested the consistency with which the ARS estimated methacholine hyperresponsiveness. We found no statistically significant correlations between DSS, ARS, or CMD20 and the age of subject, duration of asthma, or other host characteristics. There was not a significant correlation between the degree of airway obstruction and DSS or ARS noted. The results of this investigation demonstrate the value of the use of clinical information for assessing airway hyperresponsiveness and disease severity in patients with chronic stable asthma. Both ARS and DSS are useful clinical tools for estimating methacholine reactivity.\r"

  ".W": "To understand better the pathogenesis of gram-negative infections, we administered a single intravenous injection of Escherichia coli RE-2 endotoxin (4 ng/kg) to five normal volunteers and periodically measured various host-effector molecules in blood. All subjects had a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in temperature (maximum of 1.3 +/- 0.1 degrees C at 4 hours) and white blood cell count (maximum of 7700 +/- 1800 cells per cubic millimeters at 8 hours). Thymocyte costimulatory activity in blood was markedly increased 2 hours after endotoxin administration but returned to baseline at 4 hours. Blood cortisol and beta-endorphin levels paralleled each other, peaking 4 hours after endotoxin (mean increases of 21 +/- 14 micrograms/dl and p less than 0.01; 18.6 +/- 5.9 pg/ml and p less than 0.05, respectively) and returning to baseline at 8 hours. Blood histamine levels did not significantly change at any time point after endotoxin administration. Since thymocyte costimulatory activity was the first of the measured parameters to achieve peak blood levels, we suggest that endotoxin-induced increases in various cytokines may contribute to the increases in the other measured parameters and thereby play a significant role in the pathogenesis of gram-negative infections.\r"

  ".W": "In 1982, 43 ragweed-sensitive patients receiving maintenance injections of full doses of ragweed allergoid were selected for a study of the immunologic and clinical efficacy of booster injections only four times a year. These patients had participated for 2 to 7 years as part of a trial of mixes of up to four allergoids to common pollens in the mid-Atlantic area tailored to each patient's skin test sensitivity. They were divided into a group (21 patients) to receive injections every 3 months and a group (22 patients) to receive injections about every 6 weeks (eight injections per year). Patients were rerandomized after 1 year so that half of each original group switched to the alternate treatment, and this program was continued until after the ragweed season of 1985. Thirty-four patients were still under study the last year. Doses, per injection, were 100 allergoid units (1 allergoid unit equals 100 PNU) of each allergen in the mixture. Symptom scores during the 8 weeks of each of the four ragweed seasons were not significantly higher in the 3-month treated group. IgG antibody levels to Amb a I (antigen E) were followed until early 1984 and were not significantly different in the two groups, even though the 6-week treated patients received a two times higher cumulative dose per year. Rates of local and systemic reactions (percent of injections eliciting reactions) were not different in the groups, which means that the 3-month treated group had about half as many reactions by virtue of taking half as many injections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Basophils were obtained from the peripheral blood of a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia undergoing basophilic differentiation after purification on a density gradient of metrizamide. Binding studies with 125I-labeled IL-3 and 125I-labeled GM-CSF demonstrated that basophils express a single class of high-affinity receptors for each of these molecules. Saturation binding curves with 125I-labeled IL-3 revealed that IL-3 bound specifically to basophils, and analysis according to the method of Scatchard revealed that basophils express 800 to 900 receptors per cell with an apparent dissociation constant of 2.6 x 10(-11) mol/L. Saturation-binding curves with 125I-labeled GM-CSF revealed that basophils express 100 to 200 receptors per cell with an apparent dissociation constant of 4 x 10(-11) mol/L. The demonstration of high-affinity receptors for IL-3 and GM-CSF on human basophils suggests a role for these cytokines in the regulation of basophil function.\r"

All patients underwent a dose-finding phase (two weeks), followed by an open trial (two weeks), and a double-blind crossover phase (two weeks drug, two weeks placebo). Extensive neuropsychological testing (Buschke Selective Reminding procedure, category generation, picture recognition, finger tapping) and measurement of systemic cholinergic parameters were measured during each of these phases. Patients were classified as physostigmine responders and nonresponders based on a priori established criteria. Using these, nine patients were found to respond to physostigmine, while 11 were classified as nonresponders. During baseline conditions, responders when compared to nonresponders were found to have higher concentrations of red blood cell (RBC) choline (Ch) and higher ratios of RBC Ch to plasma Ch. Neuropsychological tests were found to fall into one of three categories. The first group of tests were sensitive to drug effects and differentiated physostigmine responders from nonresponders; the second group was found to predict responsiveness; and the third group was neither predictive nor sensitive to drug effects.\r"

All freshly isolated LC contained Birbeck granules and expressed high levels of CD1a, CD1c, and MHC class II molecules HLA-DR, -DP, and -DQ. They have a weak to moderate expression of RFD1, C3biR, Fc gamma R, p 150/95, MHC class I molecules HLA-ABC, and of the adhesion molecules LFA-3 and ICAM-1, whereas no expression of LFA-1 and several monocyte/macrophage markers were detected. Human LC undergo profound changes during in vitro culture. Birbeck granules, C3biR, Fc gamma R, and p 150/95 were completely lost and the expression of CD1a and CD1c was markedly decreased or lost. Expression of molecules that have essential functions in antigen presentation remained present at the same level (MHC class II molecules and ICAM-1) or was markedly enhanced (LFA-3 and MHC class I). Highly remarkable was the dramatically enhanced expression of interdigitating cell marker RFD1. The monocyte/macrophage markers initially absent remained absent and the enzyme activity initially present (including ATPase and nonspecific esterase) remained present. In conclusion, the results in this report stress rapid alterations of human LC during in vitro culture, resulting in transformation into cells that have phenotypical characteristics of potent antigen presenting cells that resemble interdigitating cells.\r"

Through flow cytometry analyses, indirect immunoprecipitation of antigen biosynthetically labeled with 35S-methionine, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoelectron microscopy, we found that a) the antigens recognized by MoAb HMSA-2 were melanosomal matrix glycoproteins; b) these antigens were expressed mainly in the cytoplasm, although they could also be detected on the cell surface; c) the cytoplasmic expression of MoAb HMSA-2 was cell-cycle dependent; d) large amounts of these antigens were released into culture supernatants; e) MoAb HMSA-2 immunoprecipitated two major glycoproteins with molecular weights of 94 and 53 kDa from culture supernatants, and f) both components have complex N-linked oligosaccharide chains with sialic acid, suggesting that these melanosomal proteins are derived from the trans-cisternae of the Golgi. These human melanosome-associated antigens may prove useful not only for studying the immunobiology of melanogenesis, but also for the immunodiagnosis of melanocytic disorders.\r"

Since DNA cytometry has been found to be of both diagnostic and prognostic value in various neoplasms, its ability to discriminate between ML and PL in Feulgen-stained imprints of 17 PL and 49 ML skin biopsies was examined by high-resolution image analysis. The reliability of the following algorithms of DNA distribution was evaluated: 1) 2cDI (2c-deviation index), which reflects the variation of the nuclear DNA values around the diploid DNA peak; 2) percentage of cells having a DNA value greater than or equal to 5c (5cER; 5c-exceeding rate); 3) percentage of cells presenting with a DNA value greater than or equal to 4c (4cER). A 2cDI of 0.1 was found to be the most reliable marker for the differentiation between PL and ML. On the basis of this feature, 16 of 17 cases of PL and 46 of 49 cases of ML were correctly classified. The sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency of this feature were 94%. A 5cER greater than or equal to 1% had a specificity of 100%, but the sensitivity was only 43%. For the 4cER, a sensitivity of 61% and a specificity of 94% were found. In conclusion, the calculation of the 2cDI and the 5cER based on high-resolution image analysis provided additional helpful diagnostic features, and therefore should be included as a diagnostic tool. If the 5cER is at least 1%, the diagnosis of a ML can be confirmed with a specificity of 100%.\r"

For 97% of the patients, treatment started within 1 h of the first sign or symptom of a recurrence. The frequency of positive lesion virus cultures was significantly lower among acyclovir-treated subjects (29/114, 25%) than among placebo-treated subjects (29/60, 48%; P = .004). Drug treatment did not affect the development of lesions, measured by the frequency of macular and papular (aborted) lesions and mean maximum lesion size. However, acyclovir hastened lesion resolution among the patients who could start treatment in the prodrome or erythema lesion stage. For this group, the mean duration of pain was reduced by 36% (P = .02) and the mean healing time to loss of crust by 27% (P = .03). Thus, oral acyclovir alleviated some of the clinical manifestations of herpes simplex labialis.\r"

IDU did not prevent the development of lesions but significantly accelerated lesion resolution in comparison with the combined control groups. For the total population, the mean duration of pain was reduced by 1.3 days (35%, P = .01) and the mean healing time to loss of crust by 1.7 days (21%, P = .004). Analysis of subpopulations revealed that the beneficial activity of the treatment was concentrated among the patients who began treatment in the prodrome or erythema lesion stage. For these patients, the mean duration of pain was reduced by 1.8 days (42%, P = .08) and the mean healing time to loss of crust by 3.3 days (38%, P less than .001). If only patients with classic herpes lesions (vesicle, ulcer, or crust formation) were considered, there was a greater drug effect on the duration of pain (reduction by 2.6 days, 49%; P = .03) and the mean healing time to normal skin was significantly shortened (reduction by 2.3 days, 23%; P = .004).

Their 50% inhibitory concentrations for HIV type 1 (HIV-1) in MT-4 cells were 0.67 and 0.52 micrograms/ml, respectively. These values are comparable to those obtained for dextran sulfate and standard heparin (0.39 and 0.89 micrograms/ml, respectively). Org 31581 and Org 31733 showed much less antithrombin activity than did dextran sulfate and standard heparin. These results indicate that the anti-HIV activity of sulfated polysaccharides can be dissociated from their antithrombin activity. Org 31581 and Org 31733 were equally inhibitory to HIV-2 and HIV-1 and were also inhibitory to the replication of human cytomegalovirus. Syncytium formation, induced by cocultivation of MOLT-4 (clone 8) cells with chronically HIV-1-infected HuT 78 cells, was also inhibited by Org 31581. As previously demonstrated with dextran sulfate and heparin, both Org 31581 and Org 31733 blocked virus adsorption to the host cells. These compounds offer great promise as candidate drugs for the chemotherapy of HIV infections.\r"

In vitro amplification using the polymerase chain reaction followed by oligonucleotide hybridization can be used to detect murine CMV DNA. When this method was applied to DNA extracted from latently infected mice, it allowed detection of viral nucleic acid not detected by standard Southern hybridization. The results of these studies support the presence of latent murine CMV in multiple organs including the salivary gland, spleen, and kidney. Amplification and detection of viral DNA in purified renal tubule preparations suggest that this may be a site of viral latency and potential source of the virus during renal transplantation.\r"

To discriminate among pathogenic E. coli isolates, chromosomal DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases that recognize eight base pair sequences and the resulting 20-25 fragments were resolved by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Different restriction fragment profiles were detected for isolates obtained from different patients, including isolates of the same evolutionary lineage that were identical in electrophoretic type, serotype, and antibiotic sensitivities. In contrast, isolates obtained from separate sites of infection within the same patient had identical restriction profiles. These results indicate that PFGE can resolve recent evolutionary divergence within E.coli lineages and, consequently, offers a powerful new means for precisely performing molecular epidemiology. In addition, these studies provide genetic evidence that E. coli urinary tract infection within a given patient is typically due to the expansion of a single bacterial clone.\r"

To investigate the mechanisms by which IgA mediates protection, the effects of Fn on phagocytosis of group B streptococci (GBS) opsonized with a type III-specific IgA monoclonal antibody were examined. Specific IgA alone or in combination with Fn did not promote the phagocytosis of GBS by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL). Fibronectin also had no significant effect on phagocytosis of IgA-opsonized GBS by monocytes. Specific IgA alone promoted phagocytosis of GBS by culture-derived macrophages in a dose-dependent fashion. Fibronectin enhanced macrophage uptake of the GBS opsonized in a suboptimal concentration of specific IgA (phagocytic index = 2.32 +/- 0.56 vs. 3.26 +/- 0.48 with Fn; P less than .05). These data suggest that protection against GBS in neonatal rats by a combination of Fn and specific IgA is mediated by macrophages rather than by PMNL or monocytes. Fibronectin may have a critical role in host defense at sites where IgA and macrophages predominate.\r"

  ".W": "In October and November 1987, eight cases of type E botulism occurred in New York City and Israel. All eight patients had eaten uneviscerated, salted, air-dried whitefish known as kapchunka. Clostridium botulinum was isolated from samples of fish, and trypsinized portions of kapchunka contained type E toxin despite levels of salt that were far in excess of those considered adequate for safety. As C. botulinum has been found in the viscera of fish from the Great Lakes, possible explanations for the outbreak include multiplication of C. botulinum and production of toxin during shipping or during processing before the fish reached inhibitory salt levels. However, there was no evidence of mishandling of the fish. More likely, the viscera provided a relatively low salt \"protective\" environment for organism multiplication and toxin production. A major public health campaign was initiated and regulations were passed prohibiting the processing, distribution, and sale of raw, uneviscerated, salt-cured fish products within New York City.\r"

One strain, E20738A, was shown to possess fimbriae of approximately 7.5 nm diameter. On SDS-PAGE two possible fimbrial polypeptides of molecular masses 17.5 and 15.5 kDa were seen; the 17.5-kDa band was the most prominent. Loss of LT and MRHA together from strain E20738A was associated with loss of a 100-MDa plasmid. An absorbed anti-strain E20738A serum reacted specifically with the 17.5- and 15.5-kDa polypeptides and bound to the intact fimbriae. This antiserum reacted positively in an ELISA with LT-positive E. coli strains of serogroups O8, O15, O48, O114, and O146. The antiserum did not react with ETEC carrying known colonization factors. The term coli-surface-associated antigen (CS) 17 has been used to describe the fimbriae.\r"

There were no significant differences in the clinical trials between HAF used alone as a complete medium and T6 + 10% HS in fertilization rates of eggs, cleavage rates of embryos up to 48 hours in culture, pregnancy success rates after embryo replacement or the outcome of pregnancies. There was no advantage in using T6 + 10% HS for fertilization of eggs and HAF as a complete medium for embryo culture and transfer in any of the parameters examined. We conclude that HAF does not meet the complete requirements of human eggs and embryos in vitro and further developments of culture media are required to obtain embryo development equivalent to that in vivo.\r"

If an isolated rise in urinary LH level was taken as indicative of LH surge, the false-positive rate was 36.7% for Higonavis and 10.2% for Ovustick. The difference was statistically significant (P less than 0.001). If only a sustained rise in urinary LH was taken to indicate LH surge, the false-positive rate was 6.1% for Higonavis and 0% for Ovustick. In the seven cycles with a spontaneous plasma LH surge, there was a positive correlation between the plasma LH levels and the two urinary assay methods in six cycles (85.7%). Compared to plasma LH, there was a mean delay of 17.4 hr by the Higonavis test and 15.6 hr by the Ovustick test. If a sustained rise in urinary LH levels was taken as indicative of LH surge, both methods are quite accurate but the Ovustick appeared to be more specific.\r"

The use of this technology has been accompanied by considerable interest in understanding the psychology of those seeking IVF/ET and in understanding psychological reactions during and after IVF/ET. This paper reviews the psychological research within the IVF/ET literature as divided into three major areas: first, psychological profiles of women and their partners requesting IVF/ET; second, clinical reports which describe the psychological experience of IVF/ET and provide recommendations for counseling both before and during IVF/ET; and third, follow-up studies of IVF/ET participants. This paper is designed to highlight initial findings in these three areas of research and thus provide a context for future research directions. Specific suggestions for future study include redirecting research effort from investigations of psychopathology to detecting stress which may affect IVF/ET outcome.\r"

Plasma samples from one pregnant patient were studied serially by functional and quantitative immunochemical assays as well as immunoblot assays for high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) and/or prekallikrein/kallikrein (PK/K). An immunoblot of this patient's HMWK from plasma obtained before she became pregnant and when she was well revealed that it was mostly an intact protein of 120 kd, similar to immunoblot results of normal plasma HMWK. In plasma samples taken throughout her pregnancy, before, during, and after clinical attacks of angioedema, all of her plasma HMWK was shown to be cleaved into the 45 kd light chain form. After delivery of the infant the 120 kd form of intact plasma HMWK returned to her plasma. In comparison, immunoblot studies on 21 normal and abnormal pregnancies revealed that plasma HMWK was an intact protein at 120 kd. That this patient's plasma during her pregnancy was contact activated was determined by additional immunoblot studies for PK/K. Immunoblot assay for plasma PK/K revealed kallikrein-alpha 2-macroglobulin complexes and a 50 kd PK/K form seen only in activated plasma samples. The findings of kallikrein-alpha 2-macroglobulin complexes and a 50 kd PK/K form disappeared after delivery. These combined studies on this patient show that the structures of HMWK and prekallikrein as indicated by immunoblot assays were altered during pregnancy. Immunoblot assays for detection of changes in the structure of HMWK and prekallikrein may be objective laboratory studies for documenting clinical attacks of hereditary angioedema, their onset, and their resolution.\r"

With the use of degraded hematin, it can be demonstrated that platelet aggregation is stimulated, that platelet adhesion to endothelial cells is enhanced, that the dissociation of factor VIII: C from von Willebrand factor is inhibited, and that the binding of the factor VII/von Willebrand factor complex to platelets is impaired. Even freshly reconstituted solutions of sorbitol-stabilized hematin affect hemostasis and induce thrombophlebitis, presumably because of in vivo degradation of the hematin. Recently, a new formulation of hematin, heme arginate, has been shown to be extraordinarily stable and to have virtually no effects on coagulation. This review compares and summarizes the effects of these various hematin compounds on hemostasis.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate whether cyclosporine nephrotoxicity is progressive, glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were determined by isotopic techniques in 24 cyclosporine-treated organ transplant recipients (12 heart, 1 pancreas, and 11 kidney recipients). The cyclosporine group demonstrated reductions in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow, with higher renal vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure as compared with an azathioprine-treated control group. However, longitudinal studies over a mean time period of 23 months in eight cyclosporine-treated renal transplant recipients showed renal function to remain stable. In the entire group of 24 cyclosporine-treated patients, longer duration of cyclosporine treatment was associated with decreased but stable glomerular filtration rate, increased renal plasma flow, decreased renal vascular resistance, and lower daily doses of cyclosporine. Evaluation of intrarenal resistances demonstrated a greater decrease in efferent than afferent arteriolar resistance, consistent with the fall in plasma renin activity that occurred with time. Short-term treatment of 12 patients with prazosin produced no beneficial effect on renal function, whereas treatment of nine patients with captopril produced a 20% increase in renal plasma flow, with a significant reduction in renal vascular resistance. We conclude that although cyclosporine treatment produces decreased renal function, the loss in renal function is not necessarily progressive. Treatment with captopril may improve the abnormal renal hemodynamics of cyclosporine-treated patients.\r"

Each period lasted for three weeks. The two agents produced similar blood pressure 3 h as well as 24 h after drug intake. Three hours after drug intake, heart rate was lower on atenolol than metoprolol CR treatment, indicating a higher degree of beta-receptor blockade for atenolol at this point in time, when the plasma concentration of atenolol was most likely to be close to its peak. Concentrations of blood glucose, serum insulin, and serum C-peptide in the fasting state or after an oral glucose load did not differ between the active agents. HbA1c was marginally, but significantly, lower on atenolol than metoprolol CR treatment. No differences were found in serum levels of total, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or apoA-I, and apoB lipoproteins or triglycerides. In comparison to the placebo run-in period, both agents showed an unexpected improvement in glucose tolerance, a decrease in HDL cholesterol and for metoprolol CR a small, but significant decrease in LDL cholesterol. Thus, treatment with metoprolol CR tablets producing even plasma levels without high peak concentrations and conventional atenolol treatment had similar effects on metabolic control in hypertensive men and abnormal glucose tolerance.\r"

  ".U": "90132423\r", 
  ".W": "The initial 227 consecutive prenatal ultrasound examinations by two family physicians in an urban community health center were compared with actual birth outcomes. Of 186 examinations for which follow-up information was available, 162 infants were represented. The sampling rate was 81%. No serious anomalies were noted by ultrasound. One placenta previa, one fetal death, and two unsuspected cases of twins were detected by ultrasound. These data represent one of the first detailed reports of outcomes reflecting family physicians' psychomotor and cognitive skill in the use of obstetric ultrasound. The high accuracy (92% to 96%) of correct ultrasound dating suggests that a short postgraduate continuing medical education course was effective for these two family physicians. The accuracy rate compares favorably to more rigorous training. This structured format utilizing the average of four direct measurements for ultrasound-estimated gestational age and three anatomy ratios for assessing proper imaging relationships or growth symmetry may be useful as other family physicians develop educational methods and quality-assurance protocols in this area.\r"

The courts have consistently ruled that persons who have a therapeutic relationship with patients have a duty to protect society from specified and foreseeable danger, yet at the same time to act judiciously in guarding against unnecessarily violating a patient's confidentiality. The dilemma imposed by this dual obligation is illustrated by a case report. Guidelines for assessing dangerousness and determining a course of action are offered so physicians can respond to their patient's threats of violence.\r"

The purpose of this article is to review the possible risks and benefits of exercise during pregnancy as presented in the literature, and to provide appropriate recommendations. There are some potential risks to the fetus resulting from maternal exercise including hypoxia, hyperthermia, and abnormal heart rate changes. The benefits, however, appear to outweigh the risks when they are minimized by prescribing appropriate exercises and using recommended precautions. Because human studies on exercise during pregnancy are currently limited, exercise prescriptions should be conservative. Swimming, biking, and aerobic walking are not associated with reported problems. Moderate aerobic exercise is safe provided the pregnancy is known to be normal. Contraindications to aerobic exercise during pregnancy include conditions that limit cardiorespiratory reserves. If a woman has been participating in an exercise program before gestation, she may be encouraged to continue the program at a moderate level if her pregnancy is normal.\r"

This program lists the differential diagnosis and definitive diagnosis of any presented disease of the skin, except single tumors. The physician operator indicates the distribution and detailed description of lesions, which the interactive system integrates with a comprehensive knowledge base. The computer diagnosis in 129 cases was compared with independent interpretation of the same information by an academic dermatologist. Results were synonymous in 66.7% of all diseases and similar in an additional 4.7%. A common differential diagnosis was obtained in 24%, for a 95.3% rate of synonymous, similar, or common differential diagnoses. Diagnosis was different in 3.9% and description was inadequate for diagnosis in 0.8%. The variation in diagnosis showed that some descriptive terms are prejudicial of certain diagnoses; that diagnostic terms are not all completely standardized; that some diagnoses are variants of another disease; and that drug-induced eruptions simulate many other diseases. A skin disease can usually be diagnosed by specific description. Most lesions that are not diagnostic from inspection are nodular. A computer can be programmed to list diagnoses according to morphologic description.\r"

A review of the historical and modern medical literature, as well as of contemporary anthropological reports, suggests multiple etiologies for lycanthropy, including seizure disorders and use of psychotomimetic drugs. A clinical illustration is presented in which the delusion of being an animal in human form has persisted for over 15 years and has been refractory to treatment. The authors speculate that disturbances of self-identity may combine with neurological abnormalities to produce some cases of this syndrome.\r"

Problems associated with NPT are discussed, including the potential effects of unrecorded concomitant sleep parameters and variability in data scoring and diagnostic criteria. In addition, less expensive and more convenient methods of NPT monitoring are reviewed, and their strengths and weaknesses are discussed. Finally, theoretical problems related to the use of NPT for differential diagnosis of organic and psychogenic erectile dysfunctions are presented. In light of the problems associated with NPT monitoring, exclusive reliance on this technique for diagnostic purposes is discouraged. Instead, a biopsychosocial approach to the understanding and assessment of erectile dysfunction is advocated.\r"

The findings suggest that patients with retinal ischaemic symptoms alone due to carotid atherosclerosis often have a carotid lesion which is of haemodynamic significance with regard to cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity. Furthermore, localized areas with reduced cerebral perfusion may also be present in some patients, without evidence of precerebral carotid occlusive disease.\r"

During the later stages, there were several deviations from this typical pattern. However, periodic activity was preceded between the 3rd and 9th week by intermittent localized or lateralized delta rhythms, which gradually changed into periodic activity. This early temporal evolution of EEG abnormalities may be helpful in the early diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease when accompanied by other investigations to exclude other causes of intermittent delta rhythms.\r"

  ".W": "Randomized trials comparing high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) plus leucovorin (LV) with standard-dose methotrexate (SDMTX) have not detected a therapeutic advantage for the HDMTX arm despite compelling evidence from experimental systems. We hypothesized that these negative trials might reflect modulation of the antitumor effect of methotrexate (MTX) by LV. To test this we randomized 61 patients with locally advanced and recurrent squamous cell head and neck cancer to receive SDMTX (40 mg/m2 weekly for 8 weeks) and either LV or placebo \"rescue\" starting 24 hours later. Of the 61 randomized patients, there were protocol violations in two cases, leaving 59 patients evaluable for response using standard criteria, and for toxicity using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. Of the 29 patients randomized to MTX plus LV, there were five responders (17.2%) compared with 11 of 30 (36.7%) patients randomized to MTX plus placebo (P = .047). Response was influenced independently by age, gender, and by previous treatment. Toxicity overall was more severe in patients randomized to MTX plus placebo (P = .016). This was accounted for primarily by differences in toxicities related to bone marrow function (neutrophil and platelet counts), stomatitis, and elevations of liver function tests. MTX therapy was more often interrupted for toxicity in the placebo group (P = .007) and discontinued for progressive disease in the LV group (P = .07). These results indicate that at the doses of MTX and LV used, LV modulates the antitumor effect as well as the toxicity of MTX in patients with head and neck cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Although prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is frequently used in the treatment of patients with limited-extent small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), its role remains controversial. One hundred fourteen SCLC patients with limited disease treated at Indiana University were retrospectively reviewed. Fifty-eight of 114 (51%) patients achieved a complete remission (CR) and were analyzed. Thirty-eight of these 58 CR patients received PCI (+PCI) and 20 of 58 CR patients did not receive PCI (-PCI). Twenty-six of 38 patients who received PCI subsequently relapsed. No patient initially relapsed in the CNS, although one patient had a brain metastasis following recurrence in the chest. Eleven of 38 patients who were treated with PCI survived for longer than 30 months and were considered long-term survivors. Seven of these 11 patients (63%) developed clinically significant neurological toxicity. Sixteen of 20 patients who did not receive PCI relapsed, but there was only one initial relapse in the CNS. Three additional patients who relapsed in the chest subsequently developed CNS metastasis. All responded to palliative radiation with improvement in their symptoms. The high incidence of CNS toxicity in the long-term survivors and the relatively infrequent incidence of isolated CNS recurrent in patients not subjected to PCI raise serious questions concerning the role, if any, of PCI in limited SCLC.\r"

  ".W": "Recent investigations have suggested a role for marrow ablative chemotherapy and radiotherapy given with autologous bone marrow transplantation (auto-BMT) in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but prospective studies have not been reported. We assessed the comparative values of auto-BMT and allogeneic marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) in 117 15- to 60-year-old consecutive patients (median, 43 years) with AML following remission-induction therapy. In 32 cases of the 90 (77%) complete responders, auto-BMT (nonpurged) was undertaken at a median of 3.8 months and in 23 eligible cases human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched allo-BMT occurred at 3.0 months after attainment of remission. Thus, nearly 60% of complete responders had access to transplantation, the others being withdrawn because of relapse, refusal, or other causes. Median time of regeneration to neutrophils 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelets 20 x 10(9)/L were 39 and 63 days following auto-BMT versus 21 and 19 days after allo-BMT, respectively. AML relapse was the predominant cause of failure after auto-BMT (17 of 32) and procedure-related death was seen in three of 32 patients. The actuarial rates of relapse at 3 years are 60% (auto-BMT) and 34% (allo-BMT) (log-rank, P = .03). Patients treated with auto-BMT and allo-BMT have an overall survival of 37% and 66% at 3 years posttransplant, respectively (P = .05). Relapse-free 3-year survival rates are 35% and 51%, respectively (P = .12). Survival of the nongrafted complete responders is less than 10%. This study shows that allo-BMT in adult patients with AML in first complete remission (CR) results in more rapid hematopoietic reconstitution, is followed by fewer recurrences, and provides better survival than auto-BMT.\r"

Patients randomized to CDDP/FU also received CDDP 20 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) bolus on days 1 to 5 of each cycle. Patients were comparable in terms of age, performance status, baseline laboratory values, dominant sites of measurable disease, and percent of liver involvement. The partial response rate was significantly greater in patients who received CDDP/FU versus FU alone (25% v 3%, P = .001). Patients who received CDDP/FU experienced significantly greater toxicity compared with FU alone: grades 3 and 4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 22% and 0% of patients, respectively (P = .0001); grades 2 to 4 nausea and vomiting occurred in 80% and 15% of patients, respectively (P = .0001). There were no significant differences in either the duration of response (median, 6 and 4.7 months for CDDP/FU and FU groups, respectively) or survival (median 10, and 12 months, respectively). Compared with infusional FU alone, CDDP/FU provided a significantly greater partial response rate with increased toxicity, but it did not improve overall survival in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma. Therefore, the use of CDDP/FU as routine therapy for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma cannot be recommended.\r"

Clinically significant and lasting tumor regression was observed only in two of 28 patients (7%), one in each of the two treatment arms. The maximum-tolerated daily dosage of rIL-2 was 3 x 10(6) U/m2; beyond this dosage, toxicity was excessive. Peripheral LAK cell activity measured in vitro and clinical tumor regression did not correlate. This observation, coupled with the equal distribution of regressions between the two treatment arms, raises the possibility that tumor regression, rare though it may be in response to rIL-2 administration, is largely mediated by TIL activation and not by LAK cell generation.\r"

To evaluate the activity of preirradiation chemotherapy in such tumors, 11 newly diagnosed children with measurable residual disease and characteristics indicative of poor prognosis were treated postoperatively with cisplatin (CDDP) and etoposide (VP-16). Responses graded on the basis of radiographic findings in areas of either macroscopic residual tumor or metastatic disease included two complete responses (CRs), eight partial responses (PRs), and one stable disease (SD). Acute and subacute toxicity consisted of high-frequency hearing loss in four patients, reversible signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure in two patients, and transient neutropenia. Seven of eight patients with high-risk medulloblastoma and two of two with pineoblastoma remain free of tumor progression following neuraxis irradiation at 8 to 48 months postdiagnosis (median, 18 months). CDDP and VP-16 is a highly active drug combination when given before irradiation in children with high-risk medulloblastoma and other malignant embryonal tumors of the CNS, producing objective responses in at least one site of measurable disease in 10 of 11 newly diagnosed patients, including all of five with gross neuraxis dissemination.\r"

  ".W": "This study reports the results of cisplatin (CDDP)-based chemotherapy (CT) as sole therapy and as neoadjuvant (NA) therapy in 28 consecutive patients (pts) with advanced basal cell (BC) and squamous cell (SC) cancers of the skin. CT in 24 pts consisted of CDDP 75 mgm/m2 and doxorubicin (Dox) 50 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks with Dox being omitted in four pts due to severe preexisting cardiac disease. Thirteen of the 28 pts received CT in the NA setting, five before surgery and eight before radiation therapy (RT). Response rates to CT were complete remission (CR) in eight of 28 (28%) pts, partial remission (PR) in 11 of 28 (40%) for an overall response rate of 68%. Thirteen pts received a second treatment modality with five of 13 pts having a CR to CT alone before the second modality and seven converting to CR postsecond modality for a total CR rate of 12 of 13 (92%) in the multimodality group. Duration of responses in the CT-only group ranged from 4 to 82 months; however, only two patients remain in remission in this group. Of the twelve CRs from the multimodality therapy group, 11 of 12 (91%) pts remain in CR with duration of response ranging from 3 to 81 months. Toxicities were manageable, with no toxic deaths and only five pts stopped CT secondary to side effects. This study suggests the combination of CDDP and Dox is highly effective in BC and SC cancers of the skin and by itself can produce long unmaintained remissions, but when combined with a second modality of therapy, it is capable of producing not only long unmaintained CRs but probable cures in the majority of pts.\r"

In addition, there are plausible arguments for setting upper limits for any nutrient added during manufacture. Various expert groups have used different approaches in setting upper limits, particularly for fat and minerals. Evidence of clinical toxicity and various biochemical measurements have been commonly used to determine appropriate upper levels. Less use has been made of the empirical evidence provided by nutrient concentrations in commonly used foods, e.g., breast milk and cow's milk. Four \"rules\" for setting maxima are suggested: a) Use evidence of clinical toxicity or reduced margin of safety if available; b) Avoid nutrient concentrations that lead to biochemical values in body fluids or tissues very different from those seen in breast-fed babies; c) An upper limit should be set for even apparently harmless nutrients that are added during manufacture; and d) When a nutrient is added, its final concentration should not normally exceed that in breast or cow's milk, whichever is the greater. Using these \"rules,\" suggested maxima for 33 nutrients are listed.\r"

Many of the criteria and systems used by manufacturers to assure the safety and adequacy of infant formulas have been codified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Product label claims represent the minimum levels of nutrient that must be present throughout product shelf life. The precise nutrient level in an infant formula at any given time may differ from the label claim because of the variability of nutrient amounts contributed by major ingredients, a decrease of certain nutrients due to heat or oxygen exposure during processing, changes during storage, nutrient levels added to account for bio-availability, and the variation in analytical results. Infant formula manufacturers use various processes and quality control systems to assure the presence of appropriate amounts of each required nutrient in each batch. Infant formula manufacturers support the review of existing upper limits and the establishment of new limits where there is a justifiable and adequate basis to do so. Where needed, new upper limits should be set with appropriate consideration of existing technical factors affecting product formulation and nutrient content. Control of upper limits can best be achieved within the framework of existing regulations and manufacturing systems to assure that only batches of formula with appropriate levels of nutrients are introduced into commercial distribution.\r"

Toxicity may be described by characteristics of the symptoms (identity, severity and degree of persistence) and by the dose-response relationship (threshold, slope, limit, susceptibility to modulation by other substances and tendency to bioaccumulate). Some nutrient toxicities are deleterious exaggerations of essential functions, whereas others are not. The therapeutic indices for nutrients should be defined as the ratio of the lowest toxic dose to the recommended intake, the ratio of the medians of the effective and the toxic doses commonly used in pharmacology. For infant formulas, a ratio of the lowest toxic concentration to the maximum concentration allowed is an analogous ratio. Nutrients with low therapeutic indices and small physical size of a toxic dose require special caution to avoid excessive intake. Modulation of absorption, metabolism or excretion, as well as the physiological state of the exposed individual, may alter the minimum toxic intake of a nutrient and hence alter the risk of toxicity. Extrapolation to estimate the toxic dose can be made on the basis of body weight, body surface area or food intake. Nutrient minimums and maximums in infant formula are set on a 100-kcal basis and thus are related to heat loss and surface area. Evaluation of vitamin A toxicity cases on a dose per 100-kcal basis suggest that the current maximum in infant formula is appropriate. Extrapolation from toxicity data in adults can be made on the dose per 100-kcal basis to estimate appropriate infant formula maximums for nutrients for which maximums have not been set.\r"

  ".W": "The potential renal solute load (PRSL) of infant feedings is the sum of dietary nitrogen (expressed as mmol of urea, i.e., mg nitrogen divided by 28), sodium, potassium, chloride and phosphorus. The PRSL determines the renal solute load, and, therefore, the osmolar concentration of the urine. When water intake is reduced and/or water losses are increased, the renal concentrating ability may be exceeded, and negative water balance (dehydration) may ensue. Under these circumstances, feedings providing high PRSL lead more rapidly to dehydration than do feedings providing lower PRSL. On the basis of simulated clinical situations and epidemiologic data, it is concluded that conventional infant formulas (PRSL 135-177 mosmol/l, or 20-26 mosmol/100 kcal) provide a satisfactory margin of safety. A feeding providing the upper limits for concentrations of protein and electrolytes specified by the Food and Drug Administration rule does not afford a satisfactory margin of safety. It is recommended that the upper limit for protein content of infant formulas be decreased from 4.5 g/100 kcal to 3.2 g/100 kcal and that an upper limit for phosphorus concentration of infant formulas be set at 93 mg/100 kcal. Maximum PRSL will then be 221 mosmol/l (33 mosmol/100 kcal).\r"

  ".W": "The pH of the plasma is determined by the concentration and chemical properties of the acids and bases dissolved in it. Three classes of acids and bases can be identified: 1) carbonic acid (CA), formed by intermediary metabolism and disposed of principally by pulmonary ventilation--variation in the rate of pulmonary ventilation controls the plasma concentration of CA; 2) metabolizable acids (MA) are either absorbed from the diet or arise in the process of intermediary metabolism and are mainly disposed of by intermediary metabolism; 3) nonmetabolizable acids and bases (NB) are absorbed from the diet and are disposed of by renal mechanisms, which also control their concentration in the plasma. Growing infants and children are in positive balance for NB, and about 96% of it is laid down in the skeleton. Because of their dietary origin and disposal in the urine, it is possible to measure the balance of nonmetabolizable acids and bases using conventional metabolic balance techniques. This is particularly important for the development of diets for young infants, as their renal mechanisms for the control of the concentration of plasma nonmetabolizable acids and bases are immature and easily overcharged. The lack of published data, however, makes it impossible to recommend maximum and minimum intakes of nonmetabolizable base.\r"

For discussion purposes we use the current upper limit proposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), namely, 4.5 g protein per 100 kcal, as our initial reference level. To help reach a conclusion, the concept and definitions of nutritional adaptation and accommodation are considered, followed by a brief review of selected studies in full-term infants fed varying levels of protein intake. Based on growth and blood biochemical data, principally plasma free amino acid levels, we conclude that the currently proposed FDA upper limit is probably too high. The available data support a recommendation for lowering the value to about 3.5 g of protein per 100 kcal. Concerns for renal solute load (RSL) may require a further, desirable refinement in the value proposed. Indeed RSL should perhaps serve as the primary basis for establishing a rational and safe upper limit for the protein content of prepared fixed-formula diets for the very young, healthy infant.\r"

Because daily intakes of 400 IU (10 g) of vitamin D2 or D3 are completely safe, and because as low as 100 IU (2.5 g) daily may prevent rickets, it is difficult to justify recent studies that attempt to firmly establish an upper limit of daily vitamin D intake in the normal neonate. Thus, despite efforts to better understand the upper limits of daily vitamin D intake, a concentration of 100 IU (2.5 g) of vitamin D per 100 kcal ingested, as is currently recommended by the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics, seems entirely appropriate.\r"

Levels this high are seldom seen with enteral vitamin E when intake is 25 mg d--tocopherol equivalent/(kg.d) or less. Intakes below this threshold will be provided by infant formulas with vitamin E to energy ratios of up to 20 mg/100 kcal (30 IU/100 kcal) so long as energy intake does not exceed 125 kcal/(kg.d). To allow a margin of safety, it would be reasonable to limit the amount of vitamin E added to the formula during its manufacture to half this amount, or 10 mg/100 kcal (15 IU/100 kcal). This level coincides with the highest levels of vitamin E found in human colostrum and is 20 times the recommended lower limit for vitamin E in infant formula of 0.5 mg/100 kcal.\r"

This high bioavailability may be explained by the presence of lactoferrin in human milk, which may facilitate iron and manganese uptake via an intestinal receptor for this protein. High concentrations of ascorbate and citrate may also facilitate uptake of trace elements from human milk and milk formulas, while a high concentration of casein in cow's milk and cow's milk formulas may limit trace element absorption from these diets. Trace element absorption from soy formula is low, mostly due to the presence of phytate but possibly also due to some protein fraction. Trace elements sharing absorptive pathways compete for uptake, and imbalances in the ratios between trace elements (Fe/Zn, Zn/Cu, Fe/Mn) in formulas may impair trace element absorption. These factors need to be taken into consideration when setting upper limits for trace elements in formulas. With our present knowledge, an upper limit for iron of 14 mg/l, for zinc, 12 mg/l, copper, 1.2 mg/l, and manganese, 0.6 mg/l are suggested. The capacity of infants to homeostatically adapt to varying intakes of trace elements needs to be further evaluated.\r"

From observations made forty years ago with cow's milk formulas it is obvious what is too much calcium and phosphorus in infant formulas. These observations were utilized in the development of \"humanized cow's milk formulas\" in the 1950s. Though the total concentrations of Ca and P have been greatly reduced in these formulas, the Ca/P ratio imbalance, compared to human milk, persists. Infants fed these formulas still receive a relative phosphorus load, and cases of neonatal tetany are still occasionally reported. Thus, formula-fed infants have higher serum P and lower serum Ca concentrations than do human milk-fed infants. Unlike Ca and P, the magnesium concentration of infant formulas is similar to that of human milk, and Mg toxicity from formulas has not been reported. Like Ca and P, however, it is difficult to determine the growing infant's requirement for magnesium. The available information does not favor either increasing or decreasing the present concentrations of Ca, P or Mg in infant formulas. The upper limit for these minerals should remain at the present concentrations: 45-50 mg/dl (65-75 mg/100 kcal) for Ca, 30-40 mg/dl (48-58 mg/100 kcal) for P and 12 mg/dl (18 mg/100 kcal) for Mg.\r"

Since selenium deficiency has been associated with two diseases of childhood, prudence dictates that the concentration of selenium in infant formula be standardized. Extrapolation from studies with human adults indicates that a daily intake of 10 g of selenium is sufficient to meet the nutritional requirement of the infant while providing a reasonable margin of safety. Extrapolation from adult studies also suggests that intakes of 75-160 g/d might have harmful effects in infants. On the other hand, no cases of selenosis in infants have been reported in high selenium areas of the United States, where human breast milk supplies as much as 47 g/d. Therefore, it is proposed that infant formulas contain enough selenium to provide 10-45 g/d.\r"

The authors tested whether adding information about personal effects of smoking would motivate hospital outpatients to stop smoking more than advice about potential hazards would. Ninety smokers in a general screening clinic were randomized to receive education alone or education plus an additional motivational intervention that contained immediate feedback about the smoker's exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) values, spirometry results, and pulmonary symptoms. A self-report of smoking status was obtained one, four, and 12 months after the intervention. In addition, at 12 months, exhaled CO measurements were made. Smokers who received the additional motivational intervention were more than twice as likely to report quitting some time during the 12-month follow-up (40% vs. 16%, p = 0.015). At 12 months, 33% of the intervention group and 10% of the control group smokers tested had achieved CO-validated cessation (p = 0.03). Counting all patients not contacted as continuing to smoke, the percentages were 20% vs. 7% (p = 0.06). These practical feedback methods to motivate cessation deserve testing in other settings.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial with randomization by physician panel. SETTING: Health maintenance organization. PATIENTS: 20,127 patients assigned to the panels of 22 primary care physicians randomly divided into an experimental group (n = 12,353) and a control group (n = 7,774), each consisting of 11 physician panels. INTERVENTION: A mailed four-page self-care pamphlet for URI care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The medical records and survey data of a random sample of 790 persons were studied during a baseline period and an intervention period. URI visit rates decreased 14% more in the experimental group versus the control group (p = 0.878). Appropriateness of URI visits during the intervention period in the experimental group (80%) was comparable to that in the control group (76%). URI drug prescriptions during the intervention period for all 20,127 patients showed no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: A simple mailed self-care pamphlet has little effect on medical care utilization for URI care.\r"

The pattern of administration generally used is characterized as short-term, high-dose or pulse therapy, which has not been associated with significant side effects or adrenal suppression beyond 10 days. The selection of an appropriate glucocorticosteroid with minimal mineralocorticoid activity and extended biological activity is desirable. Oral and parenteral dosing are possible, and the latter can be administered as acetates (repository) or esters. The efficacy of glucocorticosteroids in reducing pain, swelling, and trismus after third molar surgery is difficult to ascertain because of methodological inconsistencies between investigations. In general, studies that used low dosing schedules have failed to produce dramatic and prolonged results. High-dosing intravenous (IV) studies have demonstrated significant short-term improvements, but the effects were not sustained. Combining IV administration with multiple oral dosing or a single intramuscular (IM) dose may be required to extend short-term improvement. High-dosing IM studies have shown significant and sustained anti-inflammatory effects with a single dose administered either pre- or post-operatively.\r"

The study design of randomization to two treatment arms (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D vs dihydrotachysterol) requires a total of 108 patients with a minimum of 6 months of treatment to test the long-term effectiveness and safety of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, an essential part of the therapeutic regimen for children with chronic renal insufficiency. The frequent longitudinal assessments of nutrition and growth in children with chronic renal insufficiency can better define the natural history of renal disease and its influence on growth. Similar data in the treatment period will define the impact of treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 versus dihydrotachysterol on this natural history. Linear growth must be observed long enough (6 to 12 months minimum) to permit valid quantitation and comparison of the two vitamin D treatment arms, the multiple confounding variables that affect growth (e.g., steroid therapy, diabetes mellitus, prior vitamin D treatment) must be rigorously excluded or controlled, and the assignment of patients to the two groups must be random. These controls--sufficient study duration, sufficient patient numbers, and randomization--should eliminate extraneous sources of variation, including seasonal periodicity. This carefully developed, double-blind clinical trial with multiple participating centers and an effective organizational structure is coming close to achieving the goals of the study. An explosion of data regarding the natural history of chronic renal insufficiency and its treatment with vitamin D metabolites will be forthcoming at the conclusion of the study.\r"

As a multicenter, controlled clinical trial designed to study the relative efficacy of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and dihydrotachysterol in the treatment of renal osteodystrophy, no prior vitamin D exposure and a creatinine clearance of 25 to 75 ml/min/1.73 m2 were criteria for entrance into the clinical trial. Ages ranged from 18 months to 11 years (mean 5.6 +/- 3.1 years), and distribution by age category was as follows: 38%, 1 to 3 years; 28%, 4 to 6 years; and 34%, 7 to 10 years. There was a 3:1 male/female ratio; 72% of the patients had congenital disease by the International Classification of Diseases (ninth revision). Mean creatinine clearance was 49.5 +/- 20 ml/min/1.73 m2. The C-terminal parathyroid hormone values (1121 +/- 1562 pg/ml) were well above 2 SD of the mean of a normal growing population of similar age. Parathyroid hormone values correlated with degree of renal insufficiency (r = -0.57) and with height by bone age but not with chronologic height or growth velocity. The bone age/height age ratio, a predictor of growth potential in normal children, was low for the entire series of patients (0.88 +/- 0.35) but failed to correlate with growth velocity and was negatively correlated with rising parathyroid hormone levels. Average values for height, weight, triceps skin fold, mid-arm muscle circumference, and body mass index were within 2 SD of the mean of the normal population, although measurements for the 1- to 3-year age group were significantly less than those of the older patients. Total energy intake averaged less than 86% of the recommended dietary allowances; total protein intake was more than 161% of the allowance. Nitrogen balance in 23 patients was positive and correlated most significantly with increasing energy intake (r = 0.6). Growth velocity, calculated from the interval gain during the month control period, averaged +0.3 SD, with the highest growth velocity z scores recorded for those with acquired disease. A growth velocity index, expressed as the slope of the regression between change in height SD and growth velocity z score, was used to describe the growth accomplished in the control period by age category.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This report is derived from data obtained during the control period (6 months) before the initiation of vitamin D therapy. Up to three measurements per patient were obtained. Serum osteocalcin concentration was compared with creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate) calculated by the Schwartz formula; with serum concentrations of alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, and bicarbonate; and with the percentages of the recommended dietary allowances of calories and protein ingested. By standard correlation techniques, there appeared to be an inverse correlation between calculated creatinine clearance and serum osteocalcin concentration, and a direct correlation between serum osteocalcin and parathyroid hormone values. However, when we employed a statistical technique that takes into account repeated measures in the same patient, no correlation was found between calculated glomerular filtration rate and serum osteocalcin concentration, and no direct correlation was found between serum osteocalcin and parathyroid hormone values. The lack of a correlation between calculated glomerular filtration rate and serum osteocalcin values may be due to large fluctuations in the serum osteocalcin concentration, even though renal function is relatively stable.\r"

In the 32 months of follow-up, 704 acute illnesses were evaluated in tandem and independently by mothers and pediatricians before the history and physical examination; 20 of these illnesses were serious. The judgments of the intervention group were more reliable than those of the control group (weighted kappa = 0.50 vs 0.26, respectively), as was the specificity of their judgments (85% vs 52%, respectively; p less than 0.0001). No difference was noted in the sensitivity of intervention group and control group mothers' judgments (80% vs 90%, respectively). Teaching parents to assess specific clinical information, as represented in the AIOS, has its greatest effect on the reliability and specificity, not the sensitivity, of their judgments. Such teaching could lead to fewer unnecessary office visits during acute illnesses.\r"

A second dose of surfactant was given to patients in the treatment group if they met ventilator requirements indicating relapse or lack of response to the initial dose. No significant improvement was observed in mortality rate (9/28 vs 15/31) or incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (5/28 vs 3/31) when surfactant-treated infants were compared with control subjects, although there was a significant reduction in initial respirator and inspired oxygen requirements and the arterial/alveolar oxygen ratio improved. In addition, there was a significant reduction in pulmonary air leak in treated infants (10/28 vs 20/31; p less than 0.05). Retreatment was associated with an attenuated ventilatory response and with a higher mortality rate (7/14) than that of infants who did not require a second dose (2/14; p = 0.05), indicating a more severe form of disease. Multiple discriminant analysis, including eight independent variables, revealed that increasing birth weight, earlier age at surfactant treatment, and female gender were significantly associated with survival. These data suggest that early surfactant treatment may reduce mortality rates in very low birth weight infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome, as well as reduce ventilator requirements and the incidence of pulmonary air leaks.\r"

The isolated perfused rat kidney and kidney slice incubations were used to investigate the effect of 2-dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), a choline oxidase inhibitor, on the renal excretion and metabolism of choline. In the isolated perfused kidney, [14C]choline, at an initial perfusate concentration of 300 microM, was effectively removed from the perfusate over 25 min, with nearly all the 14C in the perfusate accounted for by betaine during the remainder of the 90-min perfusion. DMAE at concentrations of 3.0 or 5.0 mM significantly decreased the rate of removal of [14C]choline from the perfusate and the rate of addition of [14C]betaine to the perfusate, yet [14C]betaine remained the only metabolite of choline in perfusate and urine. In kidney tissue slice experiments, conversion of [14C]choline to [14C]betaine was found in cortical, outer medullary and inner medullary regions of rat kidney. DMAE at 5.0 mM significantly inhibited [14C]betaine production in each of the three regions studied. These data show that DMAE is an effective inhibitor of betaine production by the kidney and, as such, may be an important agent for the study of osmoregulation by the kidney.\r"

  ".W": "The differential sensitivity of monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes to phencyclidine (PCP) and its analogs was examined in a Mg+(+)-free physiological solution using an in vitro spinal cord preparation of neonatal rats. Whereas the monosynaptic reflex was relatively resistant to N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists [Mg++, 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) and 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate (AP7)], the polysynaptic reflex was markedly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner. The magnitude of the monosynaptic reflex only decreased 20 to 30% at concentrations of Mg++ (1.3 mM), APV (10 microM) and AP (10 microM), which completely depressed the polysynaptic reflex. PCP and its analogs also selectively depressed the polysynaptic reflex in a concentration-dependent manner and had relative potencies consistent with those for the PCP receptor [i.e., 1-(1-m-amino-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine = MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate] greater than 1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine greater than or equal to PCP much greater than (+)-N-allylnormetazocine much greater than 1-(1-m-nitrophenylcyclohexyl)piperidine. The latter compounds depressed the monosynaptic reflex to the same extent as Mg++, APV and AP7 at concentrations which completely depressed the polysynaptic reflex. Furthermore, the depression of the reflexes by PCP was unaffected by haloperidol and methiothepin precluding the involvement of sigma and serotonin receptors in PCP-induced depression of the polysynaptic reflex. Our results suggest that PCP and its analogs selectively depressed the polysynaptic reflex through PCP receptors associated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex.\r"

  ".U": "90133559\r", 
  ".W": "In awake normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats as well as pentobarbital-anesthetized normotensive rats, endothelin-1 (ET-1, 0.063-0.5 nmol/kg i.v.) produced rapidly appearing, transient, dose-related falls in mean carotid artery blood pressure followed by slowly developing small pressor responses. In the latter preparation, the hypotension was due to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance inasmuch as cardiac output increased slightly. Bilateral vagotomy, BW 755c, glibenclamide, idazoxan, propranolol, methylatropine, methysergide or promethazine pretreatment failed to modify the hypotension induced by ET-1 (0.25 nmol/kg i.v.), but this effect was blocked entirely when ET-1 was injected 8 min after starting an i.v. infusion of ET-1 (0.1 nmol/kg/min for 10 min). In pithed rats, ET-1 (0.125-1.0 nmol/kg i.v.) produced sustained pressor responses which were accompanied by reductions in cardiac output. This peptide (0.25 nmol/kg i.v.) did not affect renal vascular resistance significantly but increased (200%) mesenteric resistance substantially more (3-fold) than systemic or hindquarter resistance. The pressor effects of ET-1 were reduced by diltiazem, nitrendipine, verapamil or cromakalim and unchanged after BW 755c, desipramine, enalapril, indomethacin, methysergide, phentolamine or SK&F 100273. The sustained pressor response evoked by an i.v. infusion of ET-1 (0.25 nmol/kg/min/60 min) was also antagonized markedly by nitrendipine and cromakalim. In pithed rats with vasopressin-supported blood pressure, ET-1 produced a short-lasting hypotension which faded entirely after three successive injections of the peptide. Finally, ET-1 (0.4-0.8 nM) evoked greater contractile responses in rat aortic rings deprived of a functional endothelium than in intact preparations. However, in the latter preparation precontracted with norepinephrine, ET-1, in contrast to acetylcholine, failed to evoke vasorelaxation. In aortic rings, the sustained contractile effects of ET-1 (3.2 nM) were reduced moderately by nitrendipine (50 nM) and markedly by cromakalim (0.8 microM). In contrast, the latter compounds antagonized strongly the contractile response to KCl (25 mM). In conclusion, ET-1 appears to produce active vasorelaxation and vasoconstriction via stimulation of specific receptors on blood vessels. The tolerance to the hypotensive effect of ET-1 may indicate that either the receptor site for ET-1 becomes refractory or, alternatively, it is coupled to easily depletable endogenous hypotensive mediators. Finally, inasmuch as the vasoconstrictor effects of ET-1 can be easily counteracted by calcium antagonists under in vivo but not in vitro conditions, the membrane coupling mechanism for ET-1 may not be exactly the same in conductance or resistance vessels.\r"

  ".W": "Antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced convulsions by a variety of drugs was compared with their ability to produce phencyclidine (PCP)-like behavioral effects (locomotion and falling) in mice. Convulsions produced by i.c.v. administration of NMDA were antagonized, at doses that did not block kainate- and quisqualate-induced convulsions, by competitive NMDA antagonists (e.g., CPP and CGS 19755), noncompetitive antagonists (e.g., PCP and MK-801) and also by some putative glycine antagonists (7-chlorokynurenic acid and HA-966). Only the competitive and the noncompetitive NMDA antagonists produced locomotion and falling, and their potencies to do so correlated (r = 0.92) with their relative potencies to antagonize NMDA-induced convulsions. However, the PCP-like behavioral effects produced by the competitive antagonists were of a lesser magnitude than those of the noncompetitive antagonists, and occurred at doses higher than those needed to block NMDA-induced convulsions. The putative glycine antagonists 7-chlorokynurenic acid and HA-966 selectively blocked NMDA-induced convulsions, without producing PCP-like behavioral effects. The extent to which compounds produce PCP-like behavioral effects might depend in part on the specific component of the NMDA receptor complex with which they interact: i.e., the NMDA receptor, the NMDA receptor-associated ion channel or the glycine-sensitive modulatory site.\r"

  ".W": "The actions of a series of endogenous excitatory amino acid (EAA) agonists and synthetic antagonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor system coupled to the evoked release of gamma-[3H]aminobutyric acid (GABA) from purified populations of striatal neurons in primary culture were examined. EAA agonists displayed the following rank order of potency in evoking [3H]GABA release: glutamate greater than homocysteate greater than aspartate, NMDA greater than cysteine sulfinate. Glutamate, homocysteate and cysteine sulfinate were equieffective, whereas at saturating concentrations, aspartate and NMDA reached 75 and 65%, respectively, of the maximum efficacy of the former three agonists. The release of [3H]GABA evoked by 100 microM NMDA was attenuated in a dose-dependent manner by the following antagonists (IC50, micromolar): MK-801 (0.067), phencyclidine (0.151), CGS-19755 (3.31), 2-aminophosphonovalerate (18.8), kynurenate (100) and gamma-D-glutamylglycine (100). The antagonist properties of MK-801 and phencyclidine were not competitive with NMDA, whereas NMDA dose-response curves performed in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of CGS-19755 resulted in parallel rightward shifts (pA2 = 5.95). CGS-19755 produced similar rightward shifts of the homocysteate dose-response curve (pA2 = 5.89). At glutamate concentrations less than 100 microM, CGS-19755 and 2-aminophosphonovalerate were potent antagonists of glutamate-evoked release; however, at glutamate concentrations greater than 100 microM these agents were ineffective blockers. The blockade of NMDA-evoked release of [3H]GABA by kynurenate was not competitive in nature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The delayed neuronal death induced by a brief (15 min) application of glutamate to primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells can be prevented by pretreating the cultures with the natural ganglioside monosialoglycosylceramide (GM1), the semisynthetic GM1 with N-acetyl sphingosine (LIGA4), GM1 with N-dichloroacetyl sphingosine (LIGA20) and d-eritro 1,3-dihydroxy-2-dichloroacetylamide-4-trans-octadecene (PKS3). The semisynthetic lipids LIGA4, LIGA20 and PKS3 are more potent than the parent natural compounds. The rank order of potency for the protection against glutamate-induced neuronal death is: LIGA20 greater than or equal to LIGA4 greater than PKS3 greater than GM1; the corresponding EC50 values are 4.5 microM for LIGA20, 5 microM for LIGA4, 30 microM for PKS3 and 55 microM for GM1. The effect of the semisynthetic lipids is faster (maximal protection after a 5-min preincubation) and lasts longer (up to 24 hr) than that of the natural compound GM1. The protection from glutamate-induced neuronal death by the semisynthetic sphingolipids persists after thorough washout of free sphingolipid from the incubation medium. Therefore, LIGA4, LIGA20 and PKS3 are potent and efficacious antagonists of glutamate-induced neuronal death with a good separation between the doses needed for pharmacological action and the intrinsic neurotoxic activity. The natural (GM1) and semisynthetic (LIGA4, LIGA20 and PKS3) sphingolipids block neuronal death without affecting the function of glutamate-operated cationic channels. The protective action of sphingolipids appears to be associated with their insertion into membranes where they inhibit specific second messenger-mediated responses triggered by persistent stimulation of glutamate receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Rats were trained on a fixed-ratio schedule under which every 30th response produced food reinforcement. Five 3-min periods of fixed-ratio reinforcement were each preceded by a 10-min time-out in which responding had no scheduled consequence. Cumulative dose-effect functions for naltrexone were determined once per week by administering increasing doses during each successive time-out. Initially, only a dose of 100 mg/kg suppressed fixed-ratio responding. After eight exposures to cumulative naltrexone, however, a dose of 10 mg/kg suppressed responding. This shift to the left of the dose-effect function, or supersensitivity, persisted for at least 10-wk when naltrexone was not injected. Pretreatment with either morphine (3.0 mg/kg) or ethylketocyclazocine (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) partially prevented the naltrexone-induced decreases in response rates. Neither chlordiazepoxide nor [D-pen2, D-pen5]enkephalin pretreatments appreciably altered the effects of naltrexone. When cumulative doses of 1.0-10.0 mg/kg naltrexone were followed by two saline injections instead of the higher doses of naltrexone, over 8 wk, the naltrexone dose-effect function shifted back to the right. The return to normal naltrexone sensitivity after elimination of the two highest doses suggests that a reliable association between the lower and higher doses in a cumulative dosing procedure can result in conditioned effects to the lower doses. Similar observations of salivation elicited by cumulative naltrexone injections further support the hypothesis that the present naltrexone supersensitivity may involve conditioning processes.\r"

Responses to increasing concentrations of porcine endothelin (10(-12) to 10(-8) M) were compared in endothelium intact and denuded vessel segments utilizing diameter and membrane potential measurements. Endothelin produced a concentration-dependent contraction in arteries with intact endothelium with a maximal response of 26 +/- 2.8% of the initial diameter in physiological saline solution at 100 mm Hg of intraluminal pressure. Removal of the endothelium sensitized the smooth muscle to endothelin and increased the maximal response to 48 +/- 2.3% of the initial diameter. After incubation of the intact vessels with 10(-5) M indomethacin, the endothelin response was potentiated to the maximal value of 66 +/- 1.26% of the initial diameter of the intact vessels, and to 61 +/- 2.6% of the denuded arteries. The arterial smooth muscle cells were depolarized by 6 +/- 0.45 mV after administration of endothelin to the vessels, and by 10 +/- 0.8 mV in the denuded vessels. This depolarization was not altered by indomethacin. Our data suggest that endothelin has a direct effect on the smooth muscle of cat cerebral vascular tissue, and the sensitivity of these vessels to endothelin may be modulated by the release of dilatory cyclooxygenase products derived from the intact endothelium.\r"

Urinary excretion of brush-border peptidases increased significantly as a result of uranyl nitrate treatment. H+-coupled Gly-Sar uptake was reduced in renal brush-border vesicles from uranyl nitrate-treated rats compared to control rats. The impairment of dipeptide uptake was evident whether the uptake was measured in the presence or absence of a H+ gradient. Kinetic analysis indicated that the impairment was due mainly to a decrease in the maximal velocity of the transporter. beta-Casomorphin, a pentapeptide, was hydrolyzed to di- and tripeptides by dipeptidylpeptidase IV and the hydrolytic products were taken up actively into control brush-border vesicles via the peptide transporter. But in uranyl nitrate-treated rats, the capacity to hydrolyze and transport beta-casomorphin was greatly reduced. These results show that the ability of the kidneys to process peptides is significantly impaired as a result of uranyl nitrate-induced acute renal failure.\r"

The complexity of the metastatic process suggests that it is controlled at the genetic level via the activation and/or deactivation of multiple genes. It is now generally accepted that there are loci in normal cells that can suppress the tumorigenic phenotype and that can be inactivated by mutation. Recent evidence from somatic cell hybridization studies and DNA transfection experiments as well as the isolation of complementary DNA clones by subtractive hybridization and by differential screening predicts that an analogous (but distinct) set of metastasis suppressor genes may exist within tumor cells that can inhibit invasion and metastasis. The interaction of the gene products of potential stimulatory and inhibitory metastasis genes may be critical in determining the metastatic phenotype of tumor cells.\r"

With immunofluorescence techniques the possibility of a specific pattern and/or clustering of immune complex or complement deposits was analyzed in 140 percutaneous kidney needle biopsies performed in 73 patients with renal allograft dysfunction. The results were correlated with concomitant alterations in renal blood flow as measured by cortical and global perfusion indexes and graft survival. The deposition of IgG, IgM, C3 and C4 correlated significantly with acute rejection confirmed by biopsy (p less than 0.05, less than 0.001, less than 0.02 and less than 0.001, respectively). Subsequent graft survival was compromised when IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C4 and properdin were present together in biopsy specimens (p less than 0.05). There was a significant clustering of IgA with C3, of IgG with C3 and C4, and of IgM with C1, C3 and C4 (p less than 0.001). There also was a significant association among alterations in renal blood flow, deposition of IgA (p less than 0.05) and C4 (p less than 0.02), and graft outcome. Higher perfusion indexes, indicative of decreased blood flow, showed significant associations (p less than 0.007 and less than 0.04 for the cortical and global perfusion indexes, respectively) with a greater risk of graft loss. Although it primarily is a cellular event, the data suggest that acute rejection is associated with a deposition of various humoral factors that may mediate alterations in renal blood flow. The latter may affect graft function and structural integrity, and, thus, may show a direct correlation with the outcome of a graft.\r"

Immunohistochemical analyses on frozen and deparaffinized, formalin-fixed tissue sections have demonstrated that the Lewis X antigen is not detected in normal adult urothelium except for occasional umbrella cells. However, papillomas and transitional cell carcinomas express this blood group-related antigen in more than 90% of the cases regardless of the grade or stage of the tumor, or the blood type or secretor status of the individual. To determine the presence of Lewis X antigen on exfoliated bladder epithelial cells we used an anti-Lewis X monoclonal antibody (P-12) and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique on 129 bladder barbotage specimens. Of 40 controls 34 were negative for Lewis X antigen, for a specificity of 85%. The 89 bladder tumor patients consisted of 14 with papilloma, 13 with flat carcinoma in situ, 49 with transitional cell carcinoma, and 13 with a positive cytology and negative biopsy results. Of these 89 patients 76 were considered positive for Lewis X antigen, for an over-all sensitivity 85.4%. The sensitivity for cytology alone was 61.2%. However, the combination of a positive cytology and/or positive Lewis X antigen result yielded a sensitivity of 93.2%. The data suggest that immunocytological detection of the Lewis X antigen on exfoliated bladder cells enhances the detection of urothelial tumor cells, particularly from low grade and low stage neoplasms.\r"

In the remainder the prostate was either palpably normal, firm or enlarged by benign prostatic hypertrophy. All 64 patients with a palpable abnormality and 162 of 602 with normal rectal examination findings had a hypoechoic area on transrectal ultrasound. Biopsy of the ultrasonic abnormality was done in 148 men by the transperineal route with linear array ultrasound guidance and in 78 by the transrectal route with a mechanical sector scanner in the sagittal plane. Of the 64 patients with a nodular prostate 34 (53%) had cancer (31% of those with stages T1 and 2, 83% with stage T3 and 100% with stage T4 disease). In 14% of the patients with stages T1 and T2 cancer the biopsy showed prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3. Of the 162 patients with a palpably normal prostate who underwent ultrasound-guided biopsy 11 (6.7%) had cancer and 6 (3.7%) had grade 3 prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia detected in the biopsy material. Patients with stages T1 to T2 cancer and those with ultrasound-diagnosed impalpable cancer were not significantly different with respect to patient age (67 versus 70 years), cancer size (3.0 +/- 1.6 versus 3.9 +/- 2.5 cm.2) or Gleason score (5.4 +/- 1.2 versus 6.5 +/- 0.9). The results demonstrate that ultrasound guidance improves the yield of prostate needle biopsy. Furthermore, it is suggested that prostate cancer found by ultrasound alone is not different from early palpable disease and should be treated in the same manner.\r"

We have exploited the differences in size between the vas and epididymis to gain a mechanical advantage. When the epididymis is transected the redundant tunic is preserved. The sling is created from the tunic, which is drawn forward and sutured to the vas posteriorly about 1 cm. from its cut end. The sling provides support so that the end-to-end anastomosis between the vas lumen and specific epididymal tubule may be completed in 1 plane and without rotation. The blanket is created from the remaining epididymal tunic, which is sutured anteriorly to cover the anastomosis and stabilize the vas. The procedure was performed on 8 patients with primary epididymal obstruction. The patency rate was 50% and the pregnancy rate was 25%. Although vasoepididymostomy remains a difficult microsurgical operation, this modification seems to be beneficial in selected cases.\r"

Children with this finding are considered to have a poor short-term prognosis with a marked tendency for recurrent infections. Screening programs for bacteriuria have revealed that a few per cent of the female population are bacteriuric without symptoms of overt disease. Of 59 girls followed with untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria 52 had nodular changes of the bladder mucosa at cystoscopy. Biopsy was performed in 22 girls, and revealed lymphocytic infiltration in 19 and follicular formation in 11. The nodular changes persisted when bacteriuria continued but disappeared in patients who became abacteriuric. This finding demonstrates the reversibility of the changes, and supports the assumption that they are secondary to the presence of bacteria and not a primary lesion.\r"

Detailed questioning revealed a high frequency of symptoms, such as urgency and incontinence. The symptoms were not acute and no patient had dysuria. The urinary flow curve pattern indicated bladder emptying problems in 42% of the girls and residual urine of greater than 5 ml. was seen in 71%. Cystometry revealed consistent detrusor instability in 75% of the patients. Lower urinary tract dysfunction may explain the marked tendency for recurrent infection after treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria. With a detailed history, and noninvasive determination of urinary flow and residual urine, these abnormalities are easily detected. Bladder rehabilitation may offer a new method of treatment for these patients.\r"

Seventeen strains studied showed two distinct Omp patterns: one protein band appeared at the level of porin proteins (40 kDa) in both patterns, but Omp A protein was at the level of 36 kDa in the first pattern and a new protein was observed at 21.5 kDa in the second pattern suggesting that it is a fragment of Omp A. High molecular weight proteins were also observed in most of the strains and this finding was related to lack of free iron when the same strains were grown under iron restricted conditions in vitro. The same strains grown in pooled urine from normal females showed the first pattern mentioned above. Comparative growth on ACM of urinary strains and E. coli strains isolated from blood, feces and wounds showed an increase in the number of porins expressed (from 1 to 2 or 3, with some variability observed between strains). Differences in osmolality between pooled urine and ACM used, plus in vitro studies varying the osmolality of culture media, showed that osmolality accounted for differences in the number of porins expressed: porin expression decreased in urine the ACM of high osmolality, suggesting that the same phenomena occurred in vivo. It is concluded that host factors including low availability of iron and high osmolality present in the urinary tract influence the expression of several E. coli surface proteins. These proteins may relate to the ability of E. coli to colonize and invade the urinary tract by regulating the physiologic and/or metabolic state of the bacterial cell favoring survival of the organism in a hostile environment. Specific immune responses directed against porins could influence the outcome of this host-parasite interaction.\r"

In a system in which the arteries were tied bilaterally to ensure delivery of high drug levels to the bladder, arterial injections of CGRP significantly reduced the peak intravesical pressure of bladder contractions induced by pelvic nerve stimulation or arterial injection of carbachol. When given intravenously, CGRP had no effect on bladder contractions consequent to neural stimulation. Intravesical instillation of CGRP, however, reduced the bladder contractions significantly. Histologic staining showed CGRP-immunoreactive nerve fibers within the smooth muscle layers of the bladder wall. Intracavernous CGRP increased cavernous arterial flow and induced cavernous smooth muscle relaxation and venous outflow occlusion. Muscarinic blockade had no effect on the canine intracavernous pressure response to intracavernous injection of CGRP. Histologic staining for CGRP-immunoreactivity showed nerve-fiber-like staining within the cavernous arterial wall, the nerves running near the cavernous arteries, and the cavernous smooth muscles. Our results suggest a possible role for CGRP in the regulation of the smooth muscle tone of the bladder and penis.\r"

We have previously prepared a glycoprotein fraction (GP1) from the urinary bladder mucosa of NZW rabbits and raised murine antisera against it. These antisera react with bladder, ureter and kidney tissue from rabbits, rats, guinea pigs, and hamsters. We now show that a similar substance occurs in human kidneys and bladder. In order to remove antibodies reactive with the Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP), the antisera were initially absorbed with an immunoadsorbent composed of purified human THP covalently bound to Sepharose CL-4B gel. Using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) it could be shown that the absorbed antisera did not react with THP but retained a high titer in binding to GP1. Immunohistochemical procedures involving avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase staining demonstrated that the absorbed anti-GP1 reacted well with six human urinary bladder biopsy specimens and two kidney autopsy specimens while normal murine sera showed little or no binding. Although this reactivity was not as strong as that found with homologous tissue (rabbit) these studies suggest that GP1, an antigen common to several animal species, is also related to a human urinary tract component.\r"

Monoclonal anti-fibronectin binding to normal and malignant urothelial tissues was evaluated by an immunoperoxidase assay. Human tumor cell lines were evaluated with mixed hemadsorption and immunoperoxidase assays. In both systems, immunoreactive fibronectin had low expression on unfixed normal and malignant urothelium.

  ".W": "One hundred seventy-seven patients with infrainguinal bypass grafts were followed by use of standard graft surveillance techniques to learn more about the natural history of hemodynamic abnormalities in the patient with no symptoms. A decrease in the ankle/brachial pressure ratio of 10% or more was considered an abnormal evaluation. Results of the duplex scan were interpreted as abnormal when the peak systolic flow velocity was greater than 120 cm/sec or less than 40 cm/sec. There were 18 graft thromboses (10%) during the period of observation, and nine of these grafts were successfully revised or replaced. Recurrent symptoms prompted graft revision in 20 additional patients, and 18 of these reoperations were successful. Twenty-nine of the 38 reoperations occurred within the first 18 months of the study. The primary cumulative patency rate was 86% at 1 year and 66% at 5 years. The secondary cumulative patency rate was 91% at 1 year and 80% at 5 years. Sudden graft occlusion occurred in five patients after a normal ankle/brachial index. Most of 90 patients with abnormal ankle/brachial indexes reverted to normal at the next visit. Nineteen of the 26 that did not, had significant graft problems, but only eight patients had operable conditions, and five of the eight already had occluded grafts. No patient with a normal ankle/brachial index and duplex scan results had graft occlusion before their next surveillance visit. If the duplex scan outcome was abnormal but the ankle/branchial index normal the incidence of sudden graft occlusion was 4%. In contrast, if the duplex scan outcome was abnormal and the ankle/brachial index is reduced, then the risk of graft occlusion is 66%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The combination of duplex scanning and ocular pneumoplethysmography (OPG) has been used by many vascular laboratories for noninvasive evaluation of the carotid arteries. This study was undertaken to determine if OPG significantly improved the accuracy of duplex scanning alone. Three hundred eighty-five carotid arteries were studied in 190 patients with angiograms, duplex scans, or OPG. A total of 329 carotid arteries were examined with all three modalities. Three different criteria were used to interpret the OPG results, one each intended to deliver a high sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy. Depending on the criteria used, sensitivity of OPG alone for detecting hemodynamically significant (greater than 50%) stenosis ranged from 53% to 83%, with a specificity of 59% to 94%. Duplex scanning alone had a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 90% for similar lesions. If patients with only intracranial arterial stenosis were excluded, the sensitivity of the duplex scan rose to 91%. The addition of OPG to the duplex scan slightly increased sensitivity (range 91% to 95%; difference not significant) but significantly decreased specificity (range 56% to 84%; p less than 0.005). For detecting stenoses greater than 80%, the duplex scan alone had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 88%. The addition of OPG to duplex scanning slightly increased sensitivity for these high-grade lesions but significantly decreased specificity (p less than 0.001) and overall accuracy. These results were unaffected by the presence or absence of intracranial disease. Because the addition of OPG to duplex scanning reduces specificity and accuracy without any significant increase in sensitivity, we no longer use it as part of our routine noninvasive cerebrovascular examination.\r"

  ".U": "90134130\r", 
  ".W": "The management of internal carotid artery disease contralateral to endarterectomy is highly controversial. At our institution we have adopted an approach by which patients are followed with serial duplex scanning after unilateral carotid endarterectomy. Surgery on the contralateral carotid artery is recommended for patients who exhibit ischemic neurologic symptoms or develop an 80% to 99% carotid stenosis. This strategy is based on previous reports that have documented an increased incidence of strokes in these two groups of patients. As a result, 40 patients among a study population of 200 underwent carotid endarterectomy on the originally unoperated side. The current study reviews the natural history of the patients who were followed without or before operation of the contralateral carotid artery in an attempt to identify other cohorts at increased risk for stroke. Patients were followed for up to 126 months after unilateral carotid endarterectomy (mean, 54 months). Six patients were lost to follow-up (3.0%). By life-table analysis the estimated mean annual rate of progression to greater than or equal to 50% diameter reduction was 3.9% and 1.2% for progression to greater than or equal to 80% stenosis. Only two patients went on to occlusion during follow-up. Neurologic events referable to the contralateral carotid distribution were infrequent. The estimated mean annual rate was 2.9% for transient ischemic attacks and less than 0.8% for strokes. Case history review of the six patients who had strokes during follow-up suggested that only one patient may have benefited from carotid endarterectomy. Conservative management with serial duplex scanning of the unoperated, contralateral carotid artery appears appropriate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study prospectively randomized patients between carotid endarterectomy and nonoperative treatment with both groups receiving 1300 mg aspirin daily. All patients considered for the study had carotid angiography. Inclusion in the study required at least a 50% diameter reduction of the internal carotid artery. Four hundred forty-four patients were randomized between nonoperative (233 patients) and operative groups (211 patients). In the operative group 195 had unilateral carotid endarterectomies, and eight patients had staged bilateral procedures, for a total of 211 carotid operations. Thirty-day mortality was 1.9% (4/211); all resulting from cardiac causes. One patient who died also had a neurologic deficit. The incidence of stroke was 2.4% (5/211), and the combined stroke and mortality rate was 4.3%. Transient ischemic events occurred in two patients (0.9%). Coronary artery disease is the prime determinant of operative mortality and justifies rigorous preoperative cardiac evaluation to identify those patients at risk. This multicenter prospective clinical trial demonstrates that carotid endarterectomy can be safely performed and provides a valid standard with which to compare the nonoperative cohort.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-three patients with small (less than 6 cm in diameter) abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) were selected for nonoperative management and followed up with sequential ultrasound size measurements. Fifty-four men and 19 women, 51 to 89 years of age (mean 70 years), had an initial mean AAA size of 4.1 cm (anteroposterior) x 4.3 cm (lateral) diameter, with a calculated elliptic cross-sectional area of 14.3 cm2. After a mean of 37 months of follow-up, AAA area increased at a mean rate of 20% per year (3 cm2 yr; 0.4 to 0.5 cm/yr diameter). Expansion rate was not affected by initial aneurysm size. During follow-up, only 3 patients (4%) required urgent operation (1 died), 26 patients (36%) died of non-AAA causes, and 26 patients (36%) underwent elective AAA repair because of progressive size increase (1 died). Elective operations were performed at the rate of 10% per year, when mean AAA size had increased to 22 cm2 (5.1 cm in diameter). Multiple regression analysis of clinical parameters available at presentation indicated that subsequent elective AAA repair was predicted by younger age at diagnosis and larger initial aneurysm size. As anticipated, patients who underwent surgery had more rapid aneurysm expansion (5.3 cm2/yr) compared with patients who did not undergo surgery (1.6 cm2/yr; p less than 0.05). This difference was caused by more rapid expansion during later follow-up intervals among patients selected for operation and was not predicted by the change in aneurysm size observed during initial ultrasonographic follow-up. Final aneurysm size was predicted by initial size, duration of follow-up, and both systolic and diastolic pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-eight children who underwent diagnostic femoral artery catheterization before 5 years of age, from 5 to 14 years before the study, were randomly selected from approximately 300 surviving patients undergoing diagnostic femoral artery catheterization at our institution during the interval. Each patient underwent vascular laboratory segmental pressure and waveform examination and arterial duplex scanning, as well as lower extremity bone length radiographs, which were considered positive if the catheterized leg was greater than or equal to 1.5 cm shorter than the opposite leg. Thirteen children who had only venous catheterization served as controls. No arterial abnormalities were present in the control patients (mean ankle/brachial index, 1.01). Arterial occlusion was present in both limbs of five patients who had bilateral diagnostic femoral artery catheterization and in 14 limbs of 51 patients who had unilateral diagnostic femoral artery catheterization. Thus arterial occlusion was present in 33% of patients (19 of 58) and in 37% of limbs (24 of 65). The mean ankle/brachial index in the catheterized limbs was 0.79. Leg growth retardation was present in four limbs (8%) of 51 children undergoing unilateral diagnostic femoral artery catheterization and in one (8%) control patient. The inverse relationship between ankle/brachial index and leg growth retardation was significant (R = 0.47, p less than 0.0005). Only one patient had symptoms of arterial occlusion (claudication), and one patient had symptoms of leg growth retardation (gait disturbance). We conclude that arterial occlusion is common after diagnostic femoral artery catheterization in children less than 5 years of age, but that excellent collateral supply prevents leg growth retardation and/or symptomatic arterial insufficiency in most children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred thirteen patients (transperitoneal = 59, retroperitoneal = 54) were randomized between March 1987 and October 1988. In addition, to assess the changing course of patients undergoing aortic reconstruction similar data were gathered retrospectively on a group of 56 patients undergoing aortic reconstruction by the same surgeons performed via a transperitoneal approach in 1984 to 1985. Randomized patients were identical in age, male to female ratio, smoking history, incidence and severity of cardiopulmonary disease, indication for operation, and use of epidural anesthetics. Details of operation including operative and aortic cross-clamp times, crystalloid and transfusion requirements, degree of hypothermia on arrival at the intensive care unit, and perioperative fluid and blood requirements did not differ significantly for patients undergoing transperitoneal versus retroperitoneal reconstruction. Respiratory morbidity, as assessed by percent of patients requiring postoperative ventilation, deterioration in pulmonary function tests, and the incidence of respiratory complications, was identical in randomized patients. Other aspects of postoperative recovery including recovery of gastrointestinal function, the requirement for narcotics, metabolic parameters of operative stress, the incidence of major and minor complications, and the duration of hospital stay were similar for randomized patients undergoing transperitoneal and retroperitoneal reconstruction. When compared to retrospectively reviewed patients having aortic reconstruction, randomized patients undergoing transperitoneal and retroperitoneal operations had highly significant (p less than 0.001) reductions in postoperative ventilation, transfusion requirements, and length of hospital stay. Such trends were all independent of transperitoneal versus retroperitoneal approach.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The operative mortality rate for descending thoracic aortic dissection repair was 14% and that for descending thoracic aortic aneurysm repair was 8%, with an overall mortality rate of 10%. All three of the patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic replacement survived. The mean cross-clamp time for sutureless tube graft insertion was 9 minutes. The average blood replacement was 2.4 units/patient. No patient suffered serious neurologic or renal impairment. A single nonfatal case of graft dislodgement occurred after placement. No evidence of hemolysis, pseudoaneurysm formation, graft erosion, graft migration, or anastomotic bleeding was present in any of the remaining patients. Modification of the sutureless intraluminal device to suit the pathologic condition encountered at operation allows rapid repair with a low incidence of anastomotic complication.\r"

Medical informatics is the field that concerns itself with the cognitive, information processing, and communication tasks of medical practice, education, and research, including the information science and the technology to support these tasks. An intrinsically interdisciplinary field, medical informatics has a highly applied focus, but also addresses a number of fundamental research problems as well as planning and policy issues. Medical informatics is now emerging as a distinct academic entity. Health care institutions are considering, and a few are making, large-scale commitments to information systems and services that will affect every aspect of their organizations' function. While academic units of medical informatics are presently established at only a few medical institutions in the United States, increasing numbers of schools are considering this activity and many traditional departments are seeking and attracting individuals with medical informatics skills.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin release from pancreatic islets is impaired in chronic renal failure (CRF), and this is due to the state of secondary hyperparathyroidism of CRF. This defect in association with resistance to the peripheral action of insulin-caused glucose intolerance in CRF. It has been suggested that the impaired insulin release induced by excess parathyroid hormone (PTH) is related to the ability of the hormone to augment calcium entry into the pancreatic islets, resulting in accumulation of calcium in the pancreas. Therefore, a calcium channel blocker may antagonize this effect of PTH, and hence normalize glucose tolerance in CRF. The present study examined this postulate by studying intravenous glucose tolerance and insulin release from pancreatic islets in normal and CRF rats and in CRF animals treated with the calcium channel blocker, verapamil. Rats with 42 days of CRF displayed impaired glucose tolerance, significant reduction (P less than 0.01) in insulin release by islets, and doubling of calcium content of the pancreas (P less than 0.01) as compared to normal rats. Simultaneous treatment of CRF rats with verapamil for 42 days resulted in normal glucose tolerance, higher blood insulin levels during glucose infusion, normal calcium content of the pancreas, and normal insulin secretion by the islets. Treatment of normal rats with verapamil for 42 days did not affect any of the parameters studied. The results show that the calcium channel blocker, verapamil, by preventing calcium accumulation in the pancreas, reversed the abnormalities in insulin release that occur in CRF. This effect allowed a greater rise in blood levels of insulin during glucose infusion in CRF rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
