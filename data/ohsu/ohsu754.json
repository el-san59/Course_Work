The molecule adopts a B-DNA conformation, not unlike those found in intact dodecamer DNA molecules crystallized in a somewhat different crystal lattice, despite a gap due to the absence of a phosphate group in the molecule. The helix has a distinct narrow minor groove near the center of the molecule at the AAAA region. This suggests that the internal stabilizing forces due to base stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions are sufficient to overcome the loss of connectivity associated with the disruption of the covalent backbone of DNA.\r"

  ".W": "The mouse thymidylate synthase (TS; EC 2.1.1.45) mRNA is unusual in that the poly(A) tail is added at the translation stop codon. To determine the sequence requirements for 3' processing of this mRNA, we constructed TS minigenes with deletion and point mutations in potential regulatory sequences. The minigenes were transiently transfected into cultured cells and the effect on 3' processing was determined by S1 nuclease protection assays. These analyses revealed that at least two elements are required for efficient polyadenylylation at the stop codon. The first is an upstream AUUAAA sequence. When this was changed to AUCAAA, polyadenylylation at the stop codon was blocked. However, when it was changed to the canonical AAUAAA hexanucleotide, the amount of TS mRNA increased severalfold. The second element is a stretch of 14 consecutive uridylate residues 32 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon. This U-rich region is absent from the human TS gene, which explains why the human TS mRNA is not polyadenylylated at the stop codon even though the two genes are otherwise almost identical through this region. The most surprising observation was that the U-rich region corresponds to the 3' end of a 360-nucleotide mouse L1 repetitive element that was inserted in opposite orientation to the gene more than 5 million years ago. Thus the polyadenylylation signal of the present mouse TS gene was created by the transposition of a repetitive element downstream of a cryptic polyadenylylation signal.\r"

Analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions shows that the bulk of this unpolymerized actin migrates with a higher mobility than does pure G-actin, profilactin, or actin-gelsolin complex. When muscle G-actin is added to fresh or boiled saponin extract, the added muscle actin is shifted to the high-mobility form. The saponin extract contains an acidic peptide having a molecular mass in the range of 5 kDa, which has been purified to homogeneity by reverse-phase HPLC. This peptide also shifts muscle actin to the high-mobility form. Addition of either boiled saponin extract or the purified peptide to muscle G-actin also strongly and stoichiometrically inhibits salt-induced polymerization, as assayed by falling-ball viscometry and by sedimentation. We conclude that this peptide binds to the bulk of the unpolymerized actin in platelets and prevents it from polymerizing.\r"

  ".W": "Saposins are small, heat-stable glycoproteins required for the hydrolysis of sphingolipids by specific lysosomal hydrolases. Saposins A, B, C, and D are derived by proteolytic processing from a single precursor protein named prosaposin. Saposin B, previously known as SAP-1 and sulfatide activator, stimulates the hydrolysis of a wide variety of substrates including cerebroside sulfate, GM1 ganglioside, and globotriaosylceramide by arylsulfatase A, acid beta-galactosidase, and alpha-galactosidase, respectively. Human saposin B deficiency, transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, results in tissue accumulation of cerebroside sulfate and a clinical picture resembling metachromatic leukodystrophy (activator-deficient metachromatic leukodystrophy). We have examined transformed lymphoblasts from the initially reported saposin B-deficient patient and found normal amounts of saposins A, C, and D. After preparing first-strand cDNA from lymphoblast total RNA, we used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the prosaposin cDNA. The patient's mRNA differed from the normal sequence by only one C----T transition in the 23rd codon of saposin B, resulting in a threonine to isoleucine amino acid substitution. An affected male sibling has the same mutation as the proband and their heterozygous mother carries both the normal and mutant sequences, providing additional evidence that this base change is the disease-causing mutation. This base change results in the replacement of a polar amino acid (threonine) with a nonpolar amino acid (isoleucine) and, more importantly, eliminates the glycosylation signal in this activator protein. One explanation for the deficiency of saposin B in this disease is that the mutation may increase the degradation of saposin B by exposing a potential proteolytic cleavage site (arginine) two amino acids to the amino-terminal side of the glycosylation site when the carbohydrate side chain is absent.\r"

In this report we demonstrate that rhinovirus peptide-hepatitis B core antigen fusion proteins are 10-fold more immunogenic than peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and 100-fold more immunogenic than uncoupled peptide with an added helper T-cell epitope. The fusion proteins can be readily administered without adjuvant or with adjuvants acceptable for human and veterinary application and can elicit a response after nasal or oral dosing. The fusion proteins can also act as T-cell-independent antigens. These properties provide further support for their suitability as presentation systems for \"foreign\" epitopes in the development of vaccines.\r"

  ".W": "The visual pathway from retina through the lateral geniculate nucleus to visual cortex in the cat is comprised of several parallel neuronal streams that independently analyze different aspects of the visual scene. The best known of these are the X and Y pathways that relay through the geniculate A laminae. Recent receptive-field studies of retinal and geniculate neurons suggest that there is a further elaboration of cell types at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus. That is, two types of geniculate X cells with different temporal patterns of responses to visual stimuli are recognized, one with \"nonlagged\" features, exhibiting shorter response latencies and another with \"lagged\" features; all retinal X cells are nonlagged. We asked whether nonlagged and lagged responses represent different cell classes or two response modes of the same cells, perhaps under the control of nonretinal afferents to these relay cells. Accordingly, we studied the effects on appropriate receptive-field properties of electrical activation of the midbrain parabrachial region, which is a major nonretinal input to relay cells. Such parabrachial stimulation made each of the eight lagged X cells much more like nonlagged cells, and this stimulation completely transformed the lagged response profiles of six of the eight cells to nonlagged. We thus conclude that the property of lagged responsiveness, which is an emergent property of the lateral geniculate nucleus, is a different response mode of the same cells that can also display nonlagged responses, rather than representing different cell classes; furthermore, this switching between response modes is, at least partly, under the control of afferents from the parabrachial region.\r"

Unlike positive primary glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), this regulatory element, termed delayed sGRE, dictates an inductive process preceded by a time lag of several hours and blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Reminiscent of GREs and negative GREs (nGREs), a delayed sGRE confers hormonal regulation upon a linked heterologous promoter from a downstream position with respect to transcription start site and, remarkably, also interacts selectively with purified glucocorticoid receptor. These results imply that receptor binding to a delayed sGRE in vivo may mediate certain secondary responses to glucocorticoid hormones.\r"

  ".W": "Organophosphorus insecticide (OP) resistance in several Culex species is associated with increased esterase activity resulting from amplification of the corresponding structural gene. In Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus, high levels of OP resistance (approximately 800 times) are due to the esterase B1 gene, which is amplified at least 250-fold. This gene has now been sequenced, and the structure of the amplification unit (amplicon) encompassing the structural gene has been partially characterized. The inferred amino acid sequence of the enzyme revealed regions of strong homology with other eukaryotic serine-esterases, such as cholinesterases, which are the target of OPs. The amplicon covers at least 30 kilobases and contains a constant and highly conserved \"core\" of 25 kilobases. This core carries a single copy of the esterase gene (2.8 kilobases) as well as other sequences that are present as single or low number copies in the genomes of mosquitoes lacking overproduction of the esterase B1 protein. In the amplicon, the esterase gene is framed by two DNA sequences that are repeated in other parts of the genome of resistant mosquitoes and found in the genome of susceptible mosquitoes but not near the esterase B1 gene. It is suggested that these repetitive sequences may have a role in the amplification process.\r"

Of eight CTL clones generated, four recognized an hmHA (hmHA-1) expressed on cells from the mother and sister 3 (second donor); two recognized another antigen (hmHA-2) on cells from the father, sister 2 (third donor), and sister 3; and the remaining two clones recognized still another antigen (hmHA-3) on cells from the father and sister 3. Panel studies revealed that CTL recognition of hmHA-1 was restricted by HLA-B35 and that of hmHA-2 and hmHA-3 was restricted by HLA-B38. The HLA-B35 restriction of the hmHA-1-specific CTL clones was substantiated by the fact that they killed HLA-A null/HLA-B null Hmy2CIR targets transfected with HLA-B35 but not HLA-B51, -Bw52, or -Bw53 transfected Hmy2CIR targets. These data demonstrated that the five amino acids substitutions on the alpha 1 domain between HLA-B35 and -Bw53, which are associated with Bw4/Bw6 epitopes, play a critical role in the relationship of hmHA-1 to HLA-B35 molecules. The fact that the hmHA-1-specific CTLs failed to kill Hmy2CIR cells expressing HLA-B35/51 chimeric molecules composed of the alpha 1 domain of HLA-B35 and other domains of HLA-B51 indicated that eight residues on the alpha 2 domain also affect the interaction of hmHA-1 and the HLA-B35 molecules.\r"

Here we present the characterization of a radiation-induced mutation that simultaneously generated distinct alleles of both the limb deformity (ld) and agouti (a) loci, two developmentally important regions of chromosome 2 normally separated by 20 centimorgans. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that an interstitial segment of chromosome 17 (17B- 17C; or, possibly, 17A2-17B) had been translocated into the distal end of chromosome 2, resulting in a smaller-than-normal chromosome 17 (designated 17del) and a larger form of chromosome 2 (designated 2(17). Additionally, a large interstitial segment of the 2(17) chromosome, immediately adjacent and proximal to the insertion site, did not match bands 2E4-2H1 at corresponding positions on a normal chromosome 2. Molecular analysis detected a DNA rearrangement in which a portion of the ld locus was joined to sequences normally tightly linked to the a locus. This result, along with the genetic and cytogenetic data, suggests that the alleles of ld and a in this radiation-induced mutation, designated ldIn2 and ajIn2, were associated with DNA breaks caused by an inversion of an interstitial segment in the 2(17) chromosome.\r"

  ".U": "90207243\r", 
  ".W": "The success of cancer chemotherapy is dependent on the possibility to utilize biological differences between malignant and normal cells to selectively destroy the tumor cells. One such difference may be that of receptor-mediated cellular uptake of low density lipoproteins (LDLs). Previous studies have shown that leukemic cells from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia have elevated receptor-mediated uptake and degradation rates of plasma LDL in vitro compared to normal white blood and bone marrow cells, and that plasma cholesterol levels at diagnosis are inversely correlated with the LDL receptor activity of the malignant cells. An important question is whether the uptake of LDL by the leukemic cells is also increased in vivo. To evaluate the in vivo uptake of LDL, 11 adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia received an i.v. injection of [14C]-sucrose-labeled LDL. On degradation of [14C]sucrose-LDL, the radiolabeled sucrose moiety is known to remain trapped in the lysosomal compartment of the cells. After injection, radioactivity accumulated progressively for at least 12 hr in the leukemic cells. The uptake of radioactivity in vivo correlated with the rate of receptor-mediated degradation of 125I-labeled LDL by the leukemic cells assayed in vitro (r = +0.88, P less than 0.001). An inverse correlation between plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations and the in vivo cellular uptake of [14C]sucrose-LDL in whole blood (r = -0.76, P less than 0.01) indicates that the hypocholesterolemia is due to elevated LDL uptake by the leukemic cells. Postmortem biopsies from virtually all tissues were obtained from one patient, and the distribution of radioactivity revealed that the liver and bone marrow had accumulated most radioactivity; the adrenals had the highest uptake of label per gram of tissue weight. The results indicate that LDL may be used as a carrier targeting lipophilic cytotoxic drugs to leukemic cells.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the interaction of CD2 molecules with lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3) in facilitating nominal antigen recognition by T lymphocytes was studied by utilizing an HLA-DR4-restricted CD4+ cytotoxic human T-cell clone specific for human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein gp120 as a responder and murine fibroblasts transfected with human class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and/or human LFA-3 molecules as antigen-presenting cells (APC). Although expression of the DR4 restriction element in fibroblasts is sufficient for T-cell recognition of a gp120 peptide as judged by induction of proliferation coexpression of human LFA-3 on DR4+ APC decreases the molar requirement of nominal antigen by greater than one order of magnitude. Both LFA-3 and the relevant class II MHC molecules are necessary for antigen-independent conjugate formation, but the binding is further enhanced by specific nominal antigen. CD2-LFA-3 interaction is independent of T-cell receptor-MHC interaction and contributes directly to the stabilized conjugate between the T cell and LFA-3-bearing APC; soluble CD2 and monoclonal antibodies to LFA-3 and CD2 reduce T-cell-APC binding to the level mediated by nominal antigen and MHC. During conjugate formation, CD2 but not CD3 molecules are reorganized into the cell-cell interaction site in an antigen-independent manner. Thus, reorganization and/or coassociation of CD2 with CD3 molecules is not essential for T-cell activation.\r"

RNA of the less abundant, negative polarity, designated sTobRV-(-)RNA, has cleaving activity that was mapped previously to two noncontiguous regions of the polyribonucleotide chain. Endoribonucleolytic oligoribonucleotides (E) corresponding to the larger of the two regions cleaved smaller substrate oligoribonucleotides, at the ApG phosphodiester that is cleaved in sTobRV(-)RNA. An analogue of the substrate, which has a 2'-5' ApG phosphodiester, was not cleaved by E but acted as a competitive inhibitor of the cleavage of substrate. The analogue served as a primer, and E served as template, for reverse transcriptase-catalyzed copying of specific E sequences. The sequences transcribed suggest base pairing between the 5' region of E and a portion of the substrate that is located 3' to, but does not include, the ApG phosphodiester. Results from other experiments indicate this base pairing is a part of the functional cleavage complex. The association of the ends of E and substrate anticipates a second, 4-base-pair association between E and a portion of substrate that is 5' to, but does not include, the ApG phosphodiester. The effects of compensating mutations in E and substrate oligoribonucleotides support the existence of this second association in the active cleavage complex.\r"

Antibody treatment either before ischemia or after ischemia, but prior to reperfusion, resulted in the same degree of significant protection against endothelial, microvascular, and tissue injury. We conclude that neutrophils and increased neutrophil adhesiveness are important in the development of microvascular and tissue injury after ischemia and reperfusion and that under these circumstances, injury is primarily a consequence of reperfusion.\r"

(1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80, 95-99] [corrected] that a 7-base-pair deletion at the splice donor site of intron H-I of the albumin gene in these animals leads to impaired processing of albumin pre-mRNA. To identify the specific splicing abnormality, we examined the primary structure of cytoplasmic albumin mRNA across the junctions of exons G-H-I by RNase protection mapping, Northern blot hybridization, Southern blot analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA, and DNA sequencing. The major albumin mRNA species in NAR showed precise deletion of exon H, suggesting that this exon was skipped during albumin pre-mRNA processing. Since the intron G-H splice donor and acceptor sites and exon H sequence are normal, the finding of exon H skipping in NAR has important implications regarding the mechanism of splice site selection. Moreover, the NAR model provides an excellent system to study splicing in vivo in a higher animal.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebellar Purkinje cells are known to receive strong excitatory input from two major pathways originating outside the cerebellum and inhibitory input from two types of neurons in the cerebellar cortex. The functions and synaptic strengths of these pathways are only partially known. We have used the patch-clamp technique applied to Purkinje cells in thin slices of rat cerebellum to measure directly the postsynaptic currents arising from the two major excitatory pathways and one of the inhibitory inputs. Inhibitory synaptic currents occur spontaneously with high frequency and are variable in amplitude, ranging, in our recording conditions with high internal Cl-, from less than 100 pA to more than 1 nA. These currents are blocked by the gamma-aminobutyrate type A antagonist bicuculline. One of the excitatory inputs is all or none. For threshold stimulation, the synaptic current is either full amplitude, when the presynaptic fiber is successfully stimulated, or completely absent. This synaptic current is often larger than 1 nA and is virtually eliminated by 2 microM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, a blocking agent thought to be specific for glutamate receptors that are not of the N-methyl-D-aspartate type. Its all-or-none character identifies it as arising from a climbing-fiber synapse. The other excitatory input produces a synaptic current that is smoothly graded as a function of stimulus intensity. This response we believe arises from the stimulation of mossy fibers or granule cells. The synaptic current associated with this input is also largely eliminated by 2 microM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione.\r"

This DNA region consists of two open reading frames designated nodV and nodW. The predicted amino acid sequences of the NodV and NodW proteins suggest that they are members of the family of two-component regulatory systems, which supports the hypothesis that NodV responds to an environmental stimulus and, after signal transduction, NodW may be required to positively regulate the transcription of one or several unknown genes involved in the nodulation process. It seems likely that all host plants produce the necessary signal, whereas host specificity may be brought about by the product(s) of the gene(s) activated by NodW.\r"

Most notably, skin contains almost exclusively mRAR-gamma 1 transcripts. The conservation of the RAR-gamma isoforms from mouse to human together with their patterns of expression suggests that they perform specific functions, which may account for the pleiotropic effect of retinoic acid in embryogenesis and development.\r"

Chinese hamster ovary K1-2 cells and an x-ray-sensitive derivative were transfected with a bovine papillomavirus (BPV)-linked construct carrying the human metallothionein IIA (hMT-IIA) gene. Transfectants survived 40-fold higher levels of cadmium chloride, harbored at least 30 copies of hMT-IIA, and contained 25- to 166-fold more MT than the parent cells. Even under conditions of reduced glutathione synthesis, the transfectants were not more resistant to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation and bleomycin than the parent cells. Thus free radicals generated by these agents cannot be scavenged efficiently by MT in vivo. The hMT-IIA transfectants, however, but not control transfectants harboring a BPV-MT promoter-neo construct, tolerated significantly higher doses of the alkylating agents N-methyl-N-nitrosourea and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Resistance and MT overexpression occurred irrespective of selection and cultivation in cadmium and zinc. There was no increase in resistance to methyl methanesulfonate and N-hydroxyethyl-N-chloroethylnitrosourea. MT did not affect the degree of overall DNA methylation after N-methyl-N-nitrosourea treatment nor the level of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase. The results suggest that MT participates as a cofactor or regulatory element in repair or tolerance of toxic alkylation lesions.\r"

When geographic and genetic distances were treated as independent variables in multiple correlation analyses, they accounted for about half the variance in levels of ethological isolation. When genetic distance is held constant, the remaining relationship between ethological isolation and geographic distance is still statistically significant. When geographic distance is held constant, the remaining relationship between genetic distance and levels of ethological isolation is nonsignificant, as is the relationship between geographic distance and genetic distance when ethological isolation is held constant. Ethological isolation and genetic divergence evidently both reflect the gradual divergence of allopatric populations, but genetic distance is a poor predictor of ethological isolation in these salamanders.\r"

This condition is believed to result from a defect in the mechanism responsible for rearrangement of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes in developing B and T lymphocytes. To test this hypothesis and evaluate whether scid affects only the process of gene recombination, we introduced functionally rearranged immunoglobulin genes into the scid mouse genome. As scid mice appear to contain early lymphoid cells committed to the B lineage (pro-B cells), we asked whether the introduction of an IgM heavy-chain gene alone (mu-transgenic scid mice) or both IgM heavy- and kappa light-chain genes (mu kappa-transgenic scid mice) would allow further differentiation of scid pro-B cells into pre-B and B cells. We found that normal numbers of pre-B cells appeared in the bone marrow of mu-transgenic scid mice and that both pre-B and B cells appeared in the bone marrow of mu kappa-transgenic scid mice. However, in the latter case, the number of pre-B and B cells was 2- to 3-fold less than in the controls (mu kappa-transgenic scid heterozygotes) and few, if any, B cells were detectable in the peripheral lymphoid tissues. The implications of these results for the above hypothesis are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Many plants, as well as other organisms, accumulate betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine) as a nontoxic or protective osmolyte under saline or dry conditions. In plants, the last step in betaine synthesis is catalyzed by betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH, EC 1.2.1.8), a nuclear-encoded chloroplastic enzyme. A cDNA clone for BADH (1812 base pairs) was selected from a lambda gt10 cDNA library derived from leaves of salt-stressed spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.). The library was screened with oligonucleotide probes corresponding to amino acid sequences of two peptides prepared from purified BADH. The authenticity of the clone was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis; this analysis demonstrated the presence of a 1491-base-pair open reading frame that contained sequences encoding 12 peptide fragments of BADH. The clone hybridized to a 1.9-kilobase mRNA from spinach leaves; this mRNA was more abundant in salt-stressed plants, consistent with the known salt induction of BADH activity. The amino acid sequence deduced from the BADH cDNA sequence showed substantial similarities to those for nonspecific aldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.3 and EC 1.2.1.5) from several sources, including absolute conservation of a decapeptide in the probable active site. Comparison of deduced and determined amino acid sequences indicated that the transit peptide may comprise only 7 or 8 residues, which is atypically short for precursors to stromal proteins.\r"

In the present study we describe an in vivo model of antigen-specific transplantation tolerance to skin allografts using mice congenic at Qa1, a ubiquitously expressed class I-like molecule encoded to the right of H-2D. B6 mice are deficient in Qa1a-specific T-helper cells and only reject Qa1a disparate tail skin grafts when a second graft expressing additional helper determinants is also present. We report that animals initially engrafted with Qa1a disparate skin, in the absence of any source of additional help, are rendered tolerant to Qa1a disparate skin allografts despite the subsequent presence of inducer skin grafts expressing additional helper allodeterminants. The nonresponsive state is Qa1a-specific, because HY-bearing inducer grafts are rejected normally. In vitro, Qa1a-tolerant animals are specifically unable to generate anti-Qa1a T-killer cells, which provides the cellular basis for their failure in vivo to reject Qa1a skin allografts. Thus, initial exposure to Qa1a allodeterminants, in the absence of T-cell help, leads to a state of Qa1a-specific transplantation tolerance. This study suggests that antigen-specific transplantation tolerance may be induced by exposing naive T-killer cells to tissue alloantigens under conditions in which T-cell help is not generated.\r"

  ".W": "The product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene RB1 (Rb) is likely to function as an inhibitor of cell growth. Previous studies have suggested that certain growth-suppressing effects of Rb are exerted in G0/G1 phase and that phosphorylation can inactivate these functions. We tested this hypothesis by examining the expression and state of phosphorylation of Rb in several lineages of primary hematopoietic cells that spontaneously arrest in G0 phase. Resting lymphocytes were found to express only unphosphorylated Rb, but phosphorylation of Rb occurred as the cells entered S phase in response to mitogens. In contrast, although monocytes and granulocytes also expressed high levels of unphosphorylated Rb, these terminally differentiated cells did not phosphorylate Rb, nor could they exit from G1 phase in response to growth factors. Thus, Rb phosphorylation appears linked to the ability of a cell to synthesize DNA. In T and B lymphocytes, Rb protein increased 8-fold after stimulation, while RB1 RNA levels increased 2- to 4-fold. Nuclear run-on assays and measurement of RB1 RNA half-life in T cells suggested that the increased RNA abundance was, at least in part, due to increased RNA stability. By contrast, Rb protein levels did not increase in either monocytes or granulocytes after stimulation, although RB1 RNA levels did increase in monocytes. Thus, there are lineage-specific differences in both the regulation of Rb phosphorylation and RB1 gene expression in lymphoid and myeloid cells.\r"

Irradiation with 254-nm UV light of AcChoR-rich membranes equilibrated with d-[3H]tubocurarine resulted in covalent incorporation into the alpha, gamma, and delta subunits that could be blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin or by carbamoylcholine. The concentrations of d-[3H]tubocurarine required for half-maximal specific incorporation into the gamma and delta subunits were 40 nM and 0.9 microM, respectively, consistent with the dissociation constants for the high- and low-affinity binding sites (Kd = 35 nM and 1.2 microM). The concentration dependence of incorporation into alpha subunit was biphasic and consistent with labeling of both the high- and low-affinity d-tubocurarine binding sites. The specific photolabeling of each AcChoR subunit was inhibited by carbamoylcholine with appropriate dose dependence. These results establish that, in addition to the alpha subunits, the gamma and delta subunits also contribute directly to the acetylcholine binding sites and that each binding site is at an interface of subunits. Because the AcChoR subunits are homologous and are arranged pseudosymmetrically about a central axis, the photolabeling results are inconsistent with an arrangement of subunits in the AcChoR rosette of alpha beta alpha gamma delta and indicate that either the gamma or delta subunit resides between the alpha subunits.\r"

  ".U": "90207284\r", 
  ".W": "rutabaga1 (rut1), a Drosophila learning mutant, has adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) with reduced basal activity and the absence of calcium/calmodulin-stimulated activity. A second learning mutant, dunce, is defective in cyclic AMP degradation due to decreased or absent phosphodiesterase activity. These opposing biochemical defects allow rut1 to partially suppress the female sterility caused by elevated cyclic AMP levels in dunce flies. Selection of mutations that suppress dunce sterility has led to the isolation of two rutabaga alleles. The alleles (rut2 and rut3) decrease basal adenylate cyclase activity [Bellen, H. J., Gregory, B. K., Olsson, C. L. & Kiger, J. A. (1987) Dev. Biol. 121, 432-444] but, unlike the original rutabaga mutation, leave the calcium/calmodulin-stimulated activity intact. Behaviorally, the two alleles also differ from rut1. One of the mutations partially rescues the dunce learning defect, and flies bearing both alleles learn. Calcium responsiveness may thus be the crucial component of adenylate cyclase activity required for associative learning.\r"

  ".U": "90207286\r", 
  ".W": "The divalent cation-binding properties of the human insulin receptor tyrosine kinase domain were examined kinetically and by electron paramagnetic resonance and circular dichroic spectroscopy. The protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the purified cytoplasmic domain can be activated nearly 10-fold by 3 mM Mn2+ in the presence or absence of 5 mM Mg2+. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the purified, acid-denatured kinase domain and assays of EDTA-treated kinase show that the purified protein does not possess residual, tightly bound Mn2+. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to directly measure the binding constant of the kinase domain for Mn2+. The results indicate that the recombinant cytoplasmic domain of the human insulin receptor does not bind Mn2+ tightly in the absence or presence of MgATP (Kd greater than 0.8 mM). Furthermore, the enzyme does not show a strong preference for MnATP binding when both MgATP and MnATP are present. The far-ultraviolet circular dichroic spectrum of this domain is characterized by a negative maximum at 207 nm. In the presence of Mn2+, but not Mg2+, changes in the mean residue-weight ellipticity at 207 nm occur that are consistent with a decrease in alpha-helical content. The addition of ATP to Mn2(+)-bound protein does not further perturb the spectrum. We conclude that Mn2+ ions, although they bind weakly, induce an activating conformational change in the secondary structure of the human insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain. Activation by Mn2+ is unlikely to be significant in intact cells, but it may mimic the action of a physiological activator.\r"

Sequences from 50 clones encoding five different alleles permit assessment of the frequency and nature of PCR-produced errors. These include recombinations, deletions, and insertions in addition to point substitutions. Authentic clones were obtained at a frequency of between 30% and 70%, and analysis of three or four clones generally should be sufficient for characterization of an allele.\r"

Similar to IL-1, it is produced by monocytes and macrophages following an inflammatory challenge. Analysis of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) expression on different human cell lines indicates that dexamethasone could up-regulate the number of IL-6R on one epithelial cell line (UAC) and on two hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B). This effect was confirmed by Scatchard analysis of binding experiments, using [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine metabolically labeled IL-6. It was confirmed at the level of mRNA expression by Northern blot analysis. These results provide evidence for a link between IL-6 and glucocorticoids. They could represent an example of a system in which one role of glucocorticoids is to define more accurately the target of cytokines, and they could explain, at least partly, the frequently observed synergy between IL-6 and glucocorticoids, notably in the case of hepatocytes.\r"

In familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, the amyloidogenesis has been considered to depend on point mutations leading to TTR variants. We show that the TTR molecule in SSA, on the other hand, has a normal primary structure. Factors other than the primary structure of TTR must therefore be important in the pathogenesis of TTR-derived amyloid.\r"

Unlike most members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, this gene utilizes multiple exons to encode its leader peptide. The first exon encodes the hydrophobic region of the signal sequence; the second exon, which contains only 21 base pairs, encodes a segment of the signal peptidase recognition site; and the beginning of the third exon encodes the predicted site of peptidase cleavage. The third and fourth exons each code for immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains. The fifth exon encodes the hydrophobic transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail. Partial characterization of the Fc gamma RIIb gene indicates that it also contains multiple leader exons, including a 21-base-pair exon and two exons coding for homologous immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains. However, the Fc gamma RIIb gene uses four exons to encode its intracytoplasmic region. Analysis using contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) gels indicates that the Fc gamma RIIa and Fc gamma RIIb genes are linked within 160 kilobases on mouse chromosome 1.\r"

Sequence homologies between NGF and the recently cloned brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were used to design a strategy that has now resulted in the cloning of a gene encoding a novel neurotrophic factor, termed neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). The distribution of NT-3 messenger RNA and its biological activity on a variety of neuronal populations clearly distinguish NT-3 from NGF and BDNF, and provide compelling evidence that NT-3 is an authentic neurotrophic factor that has its own characteristic role in vivo.\r"

The selective synthesis of histone proteins during the S phase of the cell cycle is required to render cells competent for the ordered packaging of replicating DNA into chromatin. Regulation of H4 histone gene transcription requires the proliferation-specific promoter binding factor HiNF-D. In normal diploid cells, HiNF-D binding activity is regulated during the cell cycle; nuclear protein extracts prepared from normal cells in S phase contain distinct and measurable HiNF-D binding activity, while this activity is barely detectable in G1 phase cells. In contrast, in tumor-derived or transformed cell lines, HiNF-D binding activity is constitutively elevated throughout the cell cycle and declines only with the onset of differentiation. The change from cell cycle-mediated to constitutive interaction of HiNF-D with the promoter of a cell growth-controlled gene is consistent with, and may be functionally related to, the loss of stringent cell growth regulation associated with neoplastic transformation.\r"

The complementary DNA for hPRL was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and mutated to introduce sequentially those substitutions from hGH that were predicted by alanine-scanning mutagenesis and other studies to be most critical for binding to the hGH receptor from human liver. After seven rounds of site-specific mutagenesis, a variant of hPRL was obtained containing eight mutations with an association constant for the hGH receptor that was increased more than 10,000-fold. This hPRL variant binds one-sixth as strongly as wild-type hGH, but shares only 26 percent overall sequence identity with hGH. These studies show the feasibility of recruiting receptor-binding properties from distantly related and functionally divergent hormones and show that a detailed functional database can be used to guide the design of a protein-protein interface in the absence of direct structural information.\r"

  ".U": "90208319\r", 
  ".W": "Excitable media are spatially distributed systems characterized by their ability to propagate signals undamped over long distances. Wave propagation in excitable media has been modeled extensively both by continuous partial differential equations and by discrete cellular automata. Cellular automata are desirable because of their intuitive appeal and efficient digital implementation, but until now they have not served as reliable models because they have lacked two essential properties of excitable media. First, traveling waves show dispersion, that is, the speed of wave propagation into a recovering region depends on the time elapsed since the preceding wave passed through that region. Second, wave speed depends on wave front curvature: curved waves travel with normal velocities noticeably different from the plane-wave velocity. These deficiencies of cellular automation models are remedied by revising the classical rules of the excitation and recovery processes. The revised model shows curvature and dispersion effects comparable to those of continuous models, it predicts rotating spiral wave solutions in quantitative accord with the theory of continuous excitable media, and it is parameterized so that the spatial step size of the automation can be adjusted for finer resolution of traveling waves.\r"

  ".W": "Profilin is generally thought to regulate actin polymerization, but the observation that acidic phospholipids dissociate the complex of profilin and actin raised the possibility that profilin might also regulate lipid metabolism. Profilin isolated from platelets binds with high affinity to small clusters of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) molecules in micelles and also in bilayers with other phospholipids. The molar ratio of the complex of profilin with PIP2 is 1:7 in micelles of pure PIP2 and 1:5 in bilayers composed largely of other phospholipids. Profilin competes efficiently with platelet cytosolic phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C for interaction with the PIP2 substrate and thereby inhibits PIP2 hydrolysis by this enzyme. The cellular concentrations and binding characteristics of these molecules are consistent with profilin being a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of actin polymerization.\r"

The failure to express a class II gene in at least one such mutant line has been mapped to the MHC class II X box, a conserved transcriptional element in the promoter region. A complementary DNA encoding a DNA-binding protein (human X box binding protein, hXBP-1) whose target is the human DR alpha X box and the 3' flanking region has now been cloned. This complementary DNA encoded a protein with structural similarities to the c-jun proto-oncogene product, and its target sequence was closely related to the palindromic target sequence of c-jun. Mutation of the hXBP-1 DNA target sequence decreased DR alpha promoter activity in vivo. These studies suggest that the hXBP-1 protein acts as a transcription factor in B cells.\r"

The role of tyrosine phosphorylation in these events was investigated with a tyrosine protein kinase (TPK) inhibitor, genistein. At doses that inhibited TPK activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR zeta subunit, but not phospholipase C activity, genistein prevented TCR-CD3-mediated phospholipase C activation, interleukin-2 receptor expression, and T cell proliferation. These findings indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation is an early and critical event that most likely precedes, and is a prerequisite for, inositol phospholipid breakdown during receptor-mediated T cell activation.\r"

In vivo, these endogenous self peptides are not naturally presented in sufficient density by somatic cells expressing MHC class I molecules. They can, however, be presented if added exogenously.

This effect was reversed by prior treatment with MK-329, a selective antagonist of CCK at alimentary-type CCK (CCK-A) receptors. Thus, endogenous, small intestinal CCK can cause satiety in the neonatal rat and this effect involves CCK-A receptors.\r"

The membrane surface, which contained negatively charged phosphate headgroups, was bathed in a dilute ZnCl2 solution. The concentration of Zn2+ in the condensed layer at the membrane surface and the Zn2+ distribution in the diffuse layer were measured as a function of headgroup charge. The Debye length of the diffuse layer varied between 3 and 58 angstroms. The results qualitatively agree with the Gouy-Chapman-Stern model.\r"

The fluorescence emission increased quadratically with the excitation intensity so that fluorescence and photo-bleaching were confined to the vicinity of the focal plane as expected for cooperative two-photon excitation. This technique also provides unprecedented capabilities for three-dimensional, spatially resolved photochemistry, particularly photolytic release of caged effector molecules.\r"

Mathematical models are used to examine the effect of electrically coupling an oscillatory neuron to a second neuron that is either silent or tonically firing. Models of oscillatory neurons with varying degrees of complexity show that this coupling can either increase or decrease the frequency of an oscillator, depending on its membrane potential wave form, the state of the neuron to which it is coupled, and the strength of the coupling. Thus, electrical coupling provides a flexible mechanism for modifying the behavior of an oscillatory neural network.\r"

  ".U": "90208430\r", 
  ".W": "Although definitive radiotherapy in the management of early glottic carcinomas continues to offer excellent control, a small proportion of patients will have relapse. Between January 1972 and December 1984, 148 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis (stage I in 95 patients and stage II in 53 patients) had definitive radiotherapy at the University of Virginia Medical Center. We retrospectively analyzed patient data in an attempt to identify patients at risk for relapse and the patterns of failure. The three-year determinate survival for the entire population was 94.5% (stage I--100%, stage II--86%). Twenty of the 148 patients (14%) had relapse after radiotherapy. Failure in the primary site alone was observed in 17 patients (11%), two patients (1%) had relapse in the lymphatics of the neck without evidence of primary recurrence, and one patient (0.7%) had both neck and distant disease. Of the 19 patients who had definitive surgery after recurrence, 13 (68%) were successfully salvaged. Multivariate analysis was done to identify independent factors on relapse and survival. Statistically significant factors included persistent hoarseness after radiotherapy (P = .00005), impaired cord mobility (P = .00002), subglottic extension (P = .02), anterior commissure extension (P = .001), and multifocal involvement in stage I disease (P = .0008). We conclude that a majority of the small patient population with recurrent glottic carcinoma after radiotherapy may be salvaged with surgery, and we have identified patients at increased risk for recurrence.\r"

Although mandibular retrusion is not infrequently identified in patients with OSAS, the role of mandibular advancement surgery in the treatment of OSAS has not been defined. A nonobese 43-year-old white man with documented OSAS and mandibular retrusion had multidisciplinary treatment including surgical advancement of the mandible in conjunction with orthodontic treatment and prosthetic dental rehabilitation. No operation was done on the palate, nor was any other treatment provided for the OSAS. Resolution of the OSAS with dramatic improvement of the patient's snoring was achieved. This case illustrates the successful integration of corrective jaw surgery into the treatment plan for this type of patient.\r"

Seven hundred ninety-six individuals required secondary screening, consisting of stress testing and cardiac fluoroscopy. The screening process led to coronary angiography in 43 individuals; of these, 17 had obstructive coronary artery disease, ten had nonobstructive coronary artery disease, and 16 had normal coronary arteries. Application of primary screening before exercise testing increased the posttest probability of obstructive coronary artery disease to 50% in the individuals with a positive treadmill test. This is four times the expected value of 11% calculated using Bayes' theorem. The combination of a positive treadmill test and the finding of coronary artery calcification on fluoroscopy was an excellent predictor of obstructive coronary artery disease.\r"

Eleven patients, at an average of 22 years after acute leptospirosis, were reevaluated for possible delayed sequelae. Results showed that liver and renal disease had resolved, but headache and ophthalmic sequelae persisted. Even though the number of patients involved in this study is small, it appears that the eyes, particularly the anterior chambers, may be the site of continuing morbidity after acute human leptospirosis.

Computerized tomography (CT) correctly predicted the presence of a thymoma in one patient and falsely predicted a thymoma in a patient with a thymic cyst; it accurately predicted the absence of a thymoma in the remaining 11 patients. The sensitivity of CT scanning was 100%, the specificity was 92%, and the accuracy was 92%, results that are in agreement with previously published data. Compared to conventional chest roentgenography, CT scanning provided a more precise anatomic localization, and accurately predicted local invasion. We recommend a CT scan of the mediastinum in all patients with myasthenia gravis to avoid delayed diagnosis of thymoma in patients who normally would not be referred for thymectomy.\r"

Twenty-six seriously ill patients at our institution who had DPL for acute intra-abdominal disease form the basis of this report. Use of DPL indicated sepsis in ten patients; in seven of the ten, findings were confirmed at celiotomy or autopsy. Only one of the ten survived without laparotomy or confirmatory necropsy indicating the result of DPL had been false-positive. Sepsis was not indicated by DPL in 16 patients. Fourteen patients appeared to have true-negative results confirmed by operation (three patients), autopsy (four patients), or survival longer than two weeks (seven patients). Complications occurred in one patient whose DPL showed sepsis. Two patients with negative results of DPL died within two weeks of examination without confirmatory operation or autopsy and could not be evaluated. We therefore, consider the overall diagnostic accuracy in our patient group to be 95%. We recommend the use of DPL in patients suspected of an acute intra-abdominal disease process who are unable to undergo other evaluation for reasons such as critical illness.\r"

Diabetic subjects were excluded if they had hypertension, ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, or an elevated urine albumin level. After an overnight fast, blood was taken for determination of ACE, blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1), and C peptide levels. Data were analyzed according to the nonpaired Student's t test and linear regression analysis. Levels of ACE were significantly elevated in the whole diabetic group as compared with control subjects (334.0 U/L +/- 97.0 vs 250.5 U/L +/- 85.5, P less than .001). This elevation was more marked in those diabetics with background retinopathy (344.6 U/L +/- 96.8, P less than .001) and proliferative retinopathy (357.3 U/L +/- 93.2, P less than .01); no significant difference was found between ACE levels of diabetics without complications and those of control subjects. No correlation was found between ACE levels and HbA1, blood glucose, or C peptide values. We conclude that ACE levels are elevated in type II diabetes, chiefly in patients with retinopathy. This finding may reflect microvascular damage caused by secretion of ACE by the vascular endothelial cells.\r"

At this point, we began to see some patients maintain prograde portal flow. Further reduction in diameter gave a higher rate of patients with prograde flow. Postoperative flow patterns correlate with lower encephalopathy rates and better long-term survival. Important nuances of the operative technique as well as pre- and postoperative management are described.\r"

Surgical management of the individual patient was based on the extent of the ischemic process, the viability of infarcted intestine and the general condition of the patient. Nineteen patients were operated upon. Exploratory laparotomy without any attempt of intestinal resection was performed upon two patients. Eleven patients underwent resection and primary anastomosis. Second-look procedures were done upon ten patients, and in six, intestinal resection was followed by creation of a double ostomy. The over-all survival rate was reported to be 60 per cent; it was 71 per cent among the patients who were operated upon. The role of second-look procedures in improving survival time is outlined.\r"

Preoperative and postoperative serum amylase levels were determined in 178 patients who underwent routine surgical procedures. In our sample, we could not document any elevations in serum amylase levels after operations. These findings contradict those of previous reports of a high incidence of postoperative hyperamylasemia after surgical procedures except those performed upon the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, in spite of the fact that the female internal genitalia is rich in amylase and that pregnancy is considered a predisposing condition for the development of postoperative pancreatitis, the preoperative and postoperative serum amylase levels were consistently within normal range. We would like to conclude that the manipulation of female internal genitalia, pregnant or not, does not induce hyperamylasemia. Therefore, hyperamylasemia in postoperative gynecologic and obstetric patients should alert the clinician to the possibility of postoperative pancreatitis. We believe that our findings should be confirmed on large samples of patients.\r"

Operative complications, such as bladder injury, occurred in 66 patients or 0.7 per cent. Ureteral injury occurred in only three patients or 0.03 per cent. From 1972 to 1987, only five of 2,460 patients (0.02 per cent) required postoperative hemostasis.

In the majority of these patients, this was a result of fluid leakage through the patent processus vaginalis. In one female patient, fluid leaked through the implantation site of the catheter. A computed tomographic scan using contrast media is a useful diagnostic tool in identifying the side of the defect in patients with generalized scrotal or penile edema. Surgical repair of the hernia and the hole in the processus vaginalis or hernia sac prevented recurrence. A trial of temporary discontinuation of CAPD or intermittent peritoneal dialysis using small volumes of dialysis fluid prevented recurrence while reinstituting CAPD in patients with normal findings from contrast studies. Intermittent peritoneal dialysis using low volumes of dialysis fluid with stepwise increase prevented recurrence while reinstituting CAPD two to three weeks after surgical repair.\r"

No stage predominated. Inguinal lymph nodes from two patients showed, histologically, Kaposi's sarcoma and type I human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated disease. Each patient was homosexual and HIV seropositive. Changes suggestive of viral cause were present in the lymph node of one patient. The enlarged lymph nodes of the 12th patient showed stellate suppurative granulomas containing cat-scratch bacilli demonstrated by Warthin-Starry stain.

This study was done to determine the outcome of arterial surgical treatment in patients with PV. During the last six and one-half years, of 2,603 extensive vascular procedures performed, seven reconstructions were performed upon six patients with PV. Extensive complications occurred in 57 per cent of this group. All of the complications occurred in patients with disease of the lower extremity and resulted in extensive amputation in one-half of the patients. The average preoperative platelet count was higher (420,000) in patients with complications as compared with those who did well (303,000). All of the patients requiring chemotherapeutic control of the PV (hydroxyurea) had extensive complications. These results indicate that vascular operations in patients with PV carry a high complication rate. A platelet count of more than 330,000, more than 70 years of age, infrainguinal reconstruction and PV requiring hydroxyurea for control seem predictive of a poor outcome. Although this series is small, we believe that great caution should be exercised before attempting vascular reconstructions in patients with PV and the aforementioned risk factors.\r"

The incidence of biliary obstruction (16 per cent mortality rate) and leakage (48 per cent mortality rate) was 18 per cent (34 of 193) and 2 per cent (four of 193) each after choledochocholedochostomy, which was 3 per cent (five of 187) and 9 per cent (17 of 187) each after choledochojejunostomy. Biliary obstruction (16 per cent mortality rate) was more common after choledochocholedochostomy (p less than 0.005; chi-square, 23.01), whereas the incidence of more serious biliary leakage (48 per cent mortality rate) was higher after choledochojejunostomy (p less than 0.005; chi-square, 8.97). It is concluded that orthotopic hepatic transplantation remains an unforgiving extensive surgical procedure, in which choledochocholedochostomy remains the first-choice reconstruction of the biliary tract because of its lower mortality.\r"

The patients were divided into three groups by dividing the period in which the surgical procedures were done. The weight of the remnant of the thyroid gland and the incidence of surgical complications were collated for the patients in each group studied. Postoperative function of the thyroid gland was evaluated clinically and biochemically and compared with the remnant weight and total weight of the thyroid gland. The remnant weight was greatest in the first period and least in the third period. There were no differences between the frequencies of postoperative complications among the three groups in site of a remarkable decrease of the remnant weight in the third period. Remission of hyperthyroidism, including those with a latent hypothyroid state, was most frequently observed in the group in which the remnant weight was from 4 to less than 8 grams. These results indicate that the remnant weight appears to be one of the most crucial factors influencing the postoperative outcome; it thus seems appropriate to leave only small remnants of the thyroid gland (4 to less than 8 grams) at thyroidectomy. In our hands, surgical treatment is an effective and safe procedure for Graves' disease, although the precise mechanism for the remission induced by this procedure has not been elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "The short and long term effects of a model of orthotopic jejunoileal autotransplantation on intestinal motility were studied in a model of four dogs that underwent autotransplantation of the entire jejunoileum. Serosal electrodes were placed to record intestinal motility patterns. Each dog was studied during fasting and after feeding early (two to six weeks) and late (14 to 17 weeks) after jejunoileal autotransplantation. During fasting, both the innervated duodenum and the autotransplanted jejunoileum showed the characteristic migrating motor complex (MMC) early after this model of transplantation, but the MMC in the two regions lacked temporal coordination. Late after transplantation, temporal reassociation of the MMC in the duodenum and jejunoileum occurred. Feeding a small meal (50 grams of liver) inhibited the MMC in the duodenum, but not in the jejunoileum either early or late after transplantation. These observations suggest that characteristic cyclic fasting motility patterns persist after this model of small intestinal transplantation and are dissociated temporally between innervated and transplanted regions for at least eight weeks, but then reassociate with time (greater than three months). Feeding a small meal did not induce a postprandial motor pattern in the transplanted region. The effects of these changes in motility on intestinal function remain unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Although loop urinary diversion has been used successfully with renal allograft recipients, the potential and real morbidity of these diversions has led us to avoid this type of reconstruction in favor of the reconstructed bladder (3). Many of our first patients had undergone reconstruction or undiversion prior to the establishment of renal insufficiency and had a variety of augmentations (two ileocecal and three sigmoid). One additional patient underwent ileal patch augmentation three years after transplantation. However, many patients are now being seen in preparation for renal transplantation who have urinary diversions or require reconstruction and have such poor renal reserve that renal replacement therapy is inevitable. It is this latter group of patients who have prompted us to define what is the most suitable form of reconstruction of the bladder when subsequent transplantation is planned. Many forms of reconstruction and undiversion are available and appear to be equally satisfactory in the management of patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction. However, patients who are to undergo renal transplantation subsequently should be given consideration regarding the technical feasibility of the transplant operation. Accordingly, we believe that simple augmentation of the sigmoid colon as described herein prevents dissection of either iliac fossa, which greatly facilitates implantation of the allograft. As there currently appears to be no superior segment of both the large and small intestine or configuration for augmentation, augmentation of the sigmoid colon is at least as effective as other modes of reconstruction and, therefore, should be strongly considered in this population of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

AMI has been diagnosed with increasing frequency, during the last two decades, yet the mortality rate remains as high as 80% to 95%. Ninety-two patients with AMI were treated at Hadassah University Hospital between 1952 and 1987. Seventy-seven patients were treated surgically: 15 underwent only explorative laparotomy, and 62 underwent bowel resection or revascularization or both. The latter patients were divided into two groups: 17 patients treated surgically between 1952 and 1976, in whom bowel resection and primary anastomosis was the only surgical procedure carried out (group 1), and 45 patients treated in the last decade (group 2), in whom one or more of the following procedures were performed: bowel resection with primary anastomosis (n = 16), revascularization (n = 16), \"second-look\" (n = 18), and delayed anastomosis (n = 10). The overall mortality rate in 62 surgically treated patients was 40% (82% in group 1 and 24% in group 2) and 21% in 29 patients treated in a combined surgical approach. The reasons for improved results in group 2 patients are discussed, and an algorithm for surgical treatment of patients with AMI of different causes is proposed.\r"

An increase in serum PIIINP concentrations took place within the first week, and its magnitude was related to the extent of the soft-tissue operations. After the hip replacement, the maximum PIIINP concentration was reached somewhat later. Very high levels of serum PIIINP were seen in three patients with serious wound infections. The serum PIIINP antigenicity consisted both before and after surgery of equal proportions of two forms, one corresponding to the propeptide as set free during synthesis of new collagen and the other being larger and probably derived from turnover of type III collagen fibers. The proportion of the latter form was accentuated in infection. In contrast, in the wound the form derived from synthesis of type III collagen predominated. These results suggest that the postoperative increase in serum PIIINP levels is partly the result of tissue repair and partly the result of whole-body turnover of type III collagen.\r"

  ".W": "Early postoperative patch rupture is a catastrophic complication of carotid endarterectomy reconstruction with greater saphenous vein. Mechanical determinants of saphenous vein rupture were identified by structural measurements and the results applied to carotid endarterectomy patch geometry. Diameter and rupture pressure was measured in fresh saphenous vein segments from the ankle, knee, or thigh in 157 patients undergoing bypass operations. Circumferential hoop rupture stress was calculated and the results were applied to 157 carotid endarterectomy reconstructions. All vein ruptures were in the cylindric axis. The mean vein diameter was 4.58 mm. The mean vein rupture pressure was 2873 mm Hg (3.78 atm). Vein diameter was larger in the thigh than in the ankle or knee (p less than 0.01), but there was no significant difference in rupture pressure between veins from the three locations. Women had a smaller vein diameter than had men at all locations (p less than 0.01). There was a positive linear correlation between vein diameter and rupture pressure. The mean maximum diameter of curvature of 157 carotid endarterectomy reconstructions with a vein patch was 13.3 mm. Multiple random applications of the 157 veins to 157 carotid diameters predicted a mean patch rupture pressure of 1087 mm Hg (1.43 atm), 1163 mm Hg (1.53 atm) for men, and 866 mm Hg (1.14 atm) for women. Predicted vein patch rupture pressures less than 300 mm Hg were found in 5.7% of cases (8.8% women and 1.2% men). Only 0.6% of patients (1.8% women and 0% men) had a predicted rupture pressure less than 200 mm Hg. No veins with a diameter greater than or equal to 4.0 mm had a predicted patch rupture pressure less than 300 mm Hg. These results suggest that small-diameter saphenous veins have a higher risk of rupture when used as a carotid patch.\r"

Therefore we evaluated the nonpulmonary histologic findings of sepsis during a 3-day period that followed cecal ligation and perforation. In this septic model, mean arterial perfusion pressures remained unchanged from baseline, systemic flows rose by 54%, and laboratory evidence of organ dysfunction including an elevation of the serum bilirubin levels and a depression of the serum total protein values was considered mild. Concurrently, development of the hyperdynamic central circulatory septic state was associated with widespread histologic changes in myocardium, striated muscle, liver, gut, and pancreas. Lesions common to these organs included high-protein interstitial and intracellular edema, mitochondrial destruction, and patchy cell necrosis. Lesions within the pancreas were exaggerated over those noted in other organs. Of all organs examined, only the liver demonstrated microvascular neutrophil accumulation. Unlike models of shock caused by sepsis, fibrin thrombi were not seen in the microvasculature of any organ. We conclude that tissue injury characterized by the accumulation of protein-rich extravascular fluid and the development of reversible and irreversible cell injury antedated significant multiple-system organ failure in this animal model of normotensive sepsis.\r"

We have tested the hypothesis that the combined action of two inhibitory peptides may lower the effective doses of each. We further hypothesize that combined peptide responses may be responsible for the action of peptide hormones that have been difficult to demonstrate as physiologically relevant mediators, when examined as independently acting substances. In conscious dogs prepared with chronic pancreatic cannulas, stimulated pancreatic exocrine secretions were depressed in a dose-related manner by intravenous infusions of calcitonin (CT) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Doses of 2.0 nmol/kg/hr of both CT and CGRP yielded maximal inhibition of stimulated secretions of both bicarbonate (greater than 85% inhibition) and protein (greater than 55% inhibition). The lowest effective dose for either CT or CGRP, given alone, was 0.75 nmol/kg/hr, but when infused simultaneously, each at the subthreshold dose of 0.50 nmol/kg/hr, significant inhibition of protein and bicarbonate secretion was achieved. Combined infusions of the submaximal dose of 0.75 nmol/kg/hr resulted in an enhanced inhibitory response. To prove that this effect is not simply combined activation of a common receptor, we tested peptide YY (0.1 to 0.5 nmol/kg/hr) combined with CGRP and obtained similar results. Because a meal simultaneously releases a large number of active peptides, we speculate that such potentiated responses do occur physiologically. Cooperative interaction with other agents may be the primary mode of action for certain gut peptides.\r"

Patients with anergy injected with KLH alone did not generate an immune response as judged by a T cell proliferative reaction performed 14 days after immunization. In contrast, leukocytes of patients with anergy immunized with KLH together with the mediators reacted to KLH in vitro in similar numbers and with a magnitude comparable to that given by reactive, hospitalized patients without anergy immunized with KLH alone. These results confirm and extend our previous observations showing that anergy defined as a lack of cell-mediated immunity to recall antigens such as purified protein derivative extends to the generation of a systemic immune response to a neoantigen such as KLH and mediators that could restore a state of delayed hypersensitivity to purified protein derivative could also be instrumental in inducing cell-mediated immunity de novo when injected together with the antigen.\r"

MCh and alpha 2-adrenergic binding sites were characterized in the epithelium and muscularis of eight human ileal segments with 3H-N-methylscopolamine and 3H-rauwolscine, respectively. The dissociation constant for 3H-N-methylscopolamine in the epithelium and muscularis was 0.32 +/- 0.07 nmol/L and 0.45 +/- 0.10 nmol/L, respectively (p = 0.32). The MCh receptor content was approximately eightfold greater in the muscularis compared with the epithelium (p = 0.008). The dissociation constant for 3H-rauwolscine in the muscularis and epithelium was 2.55 +/- 0.42 nmol/L and 2.03 +/- 0.19 nmol/L, respectively (p = 0.29). The alpha 2-adrenoceptor density was twofold greater in the epithelium compared with the muscularis (p = 0.05). Noncumulative concentration-response experiments were performed with carbachol, an MCh agonist, and UK-14304, a selective alpha 2-adrenergic agonist. The epithelium did not contract in the presence of high concentrations of carbachol and UK-14304. The muscularis preparations were responsive only to carbachol. The muscularis contains primarily MCh receptors mediating smooth muscle contraction. The alpha 2-adrenoceptors are localized primarily to the epithelium and may regulate water secretion in the intestine. The distribution and functional properties of ileal MCh and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors provide a theoretic basis for the treatment of incontinence after bladder and rectal replacement with intestinal segments.\r"

Therapeutic approaches vary widely from conventional medical therapy to liver transplantation. If and when a patient suffering with BCS needs surgery remains a matter of contention. However, it is well accepted that portacaval shunt surgery and orthotopic liver transplantation represent efficient surgical treatments of this condition. We report on a patient with an eventful course after BCS was diagnosed. After portacaval shunt surgery the patient had acute liver failure and had a successful orthotopic liver transplantation.\r"

This case is only the seventh reported case of CAPV. Patients with CAPV commonly have additional liver anomalies, cardiac and inferior vena cava anomalies, and polysplenia. Surprisingly, hepatic encephalopathy is not a prominent feature in patients with CAPV despite systemic drainage of mesenteric venous blood. CAPV should not be considered a contraindication to hepatic transplantation.\r"

To investigate the relation between airway hyperresponsiveness and epithelial damage, biopsy specimens of the bronchial mucus membrane were obtained at fibreoptic bronchoscopy from 11 patients with mild atopic asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness (provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) less than 1.0 mg/ml), and from 17 healthy non-atopic subjects who did not have airway hyperresponsiveness (PC20 methacholine greater than 8.0 mg/ml). Observers who were blind to the presence or absence of asthma examined the biopsy specimens by light and electron microscopy. Epithelial cells, intercellular spaces, and goblet cells were counted. Intercellular junctional complexes were examined, and a semiquantitative assessment was made of ciliary loss, non-parallel central ciliary filaments, and vacuoles in ciliated cells. There were no differences between the asthmatic and healthy groups in any of these measurements. These findings indicate that airway hyperresponsiveness may be present when there is no apparent change in the structure of the bronchial epithelium.\r"

The study sample comprised 1492 smokers of plain cigarettes and 1936 smokers of filter cigarettes, 1711 smokers of cheroots or cigars, and 233 male pipe smokers. Over the five years, smokers, especially those who said that they inhaled, had a higher rate of decline of FEV1 than non-smokers, in whom the average decline in FEV1 was 25 ml/year for women and 30 ml/year for men. There was no significant difference in the decline in FEV1 between filter cigarette smokers and plain cigarette smokers. The decline in FEV1 in cigar or cheroot smokers was the highest for all the smoking groups, and associated with a very high tobacco consumption in this group. Among pipe smokers who inhaled, the decline in FEV1 was slightly higher than in the cigarette smokers, whereas non-inhaling pipe smokers had a decline in FEV1 that was similar to that of non-smokers. In general, the smokers who said that they did not inhale had a smaller decline in FEV1 than those who said that they did. The effect of inhalation varied in magnitude in different smoking groups, being most pronounced in pipe smokers.\r"

The adverse effect of passive smoking was greatest among men exposed at the workplace (reduction in % predicted FEV1 9.4%, FVC 7.6%, and FEF25-75 15.3%). No significant difference in pulmonary function was found among the 54 women exposed to passive smoke, but only eight women had smoke exposure at work.

  ".W": "Pulmonary surfactant has been shown by this group to suppress peripheral blood lymphocyte responses to mitogens and alloantigens in a dose dependent manner, though the mechanism of action of the suppressive effect is not clearly understood. To try to clarify this, attempts were made to reverse the effects of preincubation with surfactant, obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from pigs, on lymphocytes and accessory monocytes obtained from the blood of normal volunteers, by washing and incubating the cells in medium alone for various periods up to 24 hours. Immunosuppression, measured as the reduction in thymidine incorporation in response to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin, could not be reversed by these methods. The addition of indomethacin (up to 100 micrograms/ml for 72 hours) also had no effect, indicating that the immunosuppression was not related to synthesis of prostaglandins. Incubation with surfactant for as little as two hours before addition of mitogen suppressed in vitro lymphoproliferative responses by half, but surfactant added two hours after mitogen had no observed effect. Preincubation of purified lymphocytes in surfactant, before they were cultured with accessory monocytes and mitogen, caused significant suppression of response, but preincubation of purified monocytes had no suppressive effect. There was no change in the intensity of HLA-DR expression on monocytes. These results support the hypothesis that surfactant exerts its effects on the resting uncommitted lymphocyte rather than on antigen presenting monocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Data collected during seven population health surveys over 18 years in Busselton, Western Australia, were examined to determine the effect of smoking on lung function and to investigate the development of chronic airflow limitation. Lung function was measured and details of respiratory illness and smoking histories were collected from subjects attending surveys at three year intervals from 1966 to 1984. Data from ex-smokers and asthmatic patients (diagnosis based on answer to questionnaire) were excluded. Regression of height adjusted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) on age was calculated individually for 759 non-smokers and 225 regular smokers with four or more observations. Decline in height adjusted FEV1 was similar for men and women. In smokers the rate of decline in FEV1 was greater than in non-smokers and was related to the amount smoked, to the extent that a smoker could expect a 20-30% greater rate of decline than a non-smoker of the same age. Chronic airflow limitation (defined as FEV1/FEV less than 65% or FEV1 less than 65% predicted on at least two occasions) was common, occurring in 24% of men and 18% of women who were regular smokers and in 5% of male and 8% of female non-smokers. These figures are higher than those reported in other populations, especially for women and for non-smokers. Not all chronic airflow limitation was associated with respiratory symptoms, confirming that the condition may be unrecognised until it is advanced.\r"

  ".W": "Several studies have shown that after fibreoptic bronchoscopy there may be a deterioration in lung function but it is not known whether this is due to the premedication, the topical anaesthetic, or the obstruction produced by the bronchoscope. The effects of each part of the procedure on spirometric measurements were studied in patients with lung disease and in normal non-smokers. Measurements were made after premedication (papaveretum and atropine) in seven patients and after topical anaesthesia of the bronchial tree (340 mg lignocaine) with and without the bronchoscope in the trachea in 21 patients and 10 control subjects. Premedication had no effect. In the normal subjects lignocaine produced significant falls in FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and peak inspiratory flow (PIF), and insertion of the bronchoscope caused further falls that were also significant. In the patients, however, although anaesthesia produced significant falls in FEV1, FVC, PEF, and PIF of similar magnitude to those found in the normal subjects, there was no further important decrease when the bronchoscope was inserted. It is concluded that the major effect of bronchoscopy on lung function is due to topical lignocaine in the airways, and in patients with lung disease (excluding asthma or a central obstructing carcinoma) the insertion of the bronchoscope causes little additional obstruction.\r"

One patient was infected with M kansasii and one with M ulcerans. Invasive procedures were frequently required to obtain positive bacteriological results. Subclinical carriage of M avium-intracellulare and other mycobacteria thought to be nonpathogenic was common in patients seronegative for the human immunodeficiency virus and at all stages of human immunodeficiency virus infection. All but one isolate of M tuberculosis were fully sensitive to standard antimycobacterial antibiotics. Response to treatment was usually rapid. M avium-intracellulare isolates were all resistant to first line agents in vitro, and antibiotics such as ansamycin and amikacin were required to obtain a clinical response.\r"

Thirty eight per cent of respondents had not seen an HIV positive patient at the time of the survey. Respiratory physicians followed General Medical Council guidelines in relation to consent and confidentiality, except that if the patient's consent was withheld three quarters of the physicians would still inform an at risk hospital health care worker; only a quarter, however, would inform an at risk spouse. Routine infection control was frequently inadequate and \"disease specific\"--that is, substantially increased for known HIV positive patients. Given an HIV positive patient with respiratory symptoms and an abnormal chest radiograph, two thirds of respiratory physicians said that they would treat empirically for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia as opposed to immediate bronchoscopy for accurate diagnosis. If a patient with AIDS who had pneumocystis pneumonia developed respiratory failure, half the physicians said at that time that they would elect not to ventilate the patient.\r"

This peptide, which is present in greatest amounts in the central and autonomic nervous systems, has previously been found in bronchial neoplasms. The mean serum concentration of leucine-enkephalin was significantly greater in the patients with carcinoma (1035 pg/ml) than in the control subjects (426 pg/ml). In the 23 patients with a tumour in non-apical regions of the lung, however, the mean concentration of the peptide (422 pg/ml) did not differ significantly from that in control subjects; serum concentrations in the seven patients with an apical neoplasm (mean 3050 (range 1259-5820) pg/ml) were significantly greater than values in either the control subjects or the patients with non-apical lung tumours. All seven subjects with an apical tumour had one or more features of Horner's syndrome and the three with all four components of the syndrome had the highest serum concentrations. Serum concentrations of leucine-enkephalin were unrelated to tumour type or presence of metastatic disease. No patient had evidence of metastases in the central nervous system or adrenal glands. Raised serum concentrations of leucine-enkephalin in patients with an apical tumour probably reflect invasion of cervical sympathetic ganglia with release of the peptide into the circulation rather than elaboration of the peptide by the neoplasm.\r"

An abnormal PSA was measured in 91 percent and 93 percent, respectively, of the samples collected prior to or during radiation therapy. By seven months, 8/15 men still had an abnormal PSA level. Four of 5 men with an elevated PSA at least twenty-three months after radiation therapy had a positive prostatic biopsy, and 3/3 patients with a normal PSA had a negative ultrasonically guided biopsy. The rate of decline of serum PSA after radiation therapy is variable. These preliminary data suggest that serum PSA may be useful for assessing the local response of prostate cancer to radiation therapy.\r"

The patients, ages twenty-four through fifty-eight (average 42 years), were all physically healthy and taking no medications. Five patients had normal findings on nocturnal tumescence monitor, while 3 patients did not use the monitor. A mixture of phentolamine mesylate, 1.0 mg/mL, and papaverine hydrochloride, 30 mg/mL, was used. The dosage required was from 0.10 mL to 0.40 mL. All 8 patients responded successfully to this treatment. Three patients stated they were cured and stopped the treatment. The other 5 patients continued using the medication after fourteen months. The drug-induced erection lasted between two and four hours despite ejaculation. There have been no side effects through April, 1988. All patients report satisfaction with the results of this treatment. The study showed that intracavernous medication therapy can be successful in the treatment of premature ejaculation.\r"

The postoperative follow-up period was from six to thirty-nine months. The clinical results showed no metabolic disturbance of blood electrolytes or acidity. Prolapse of efferent nipple valve developed in 4 patients (7.6%); and 2 underwent revisional surgery with a good result. Another 4 patients (7.6%) suffered from poor continence and relatively frequent catheterization to empty the pouch was necessary to prevent urine leakage through the stoma. Urodynamic study of the Kock pouch in these 4 patients showed a short functional nipple valve length and small pouch capacity. The other 45 patients (84.8%) had good continence. Urodynamic study of the pouch in 20 patients showed low pressure (mean of 13.3 cm H2O) in the pouch and high pressure (mean of 72.1 cm H2O) at the efferent nipple valve. Three patients had unilateral hydronephrosis in the follow-up intravenous urography. Corrective surgery for stenosis at the right ureteroileal anastomosis was done in 1 patient with normalization of the upper urinary tract afterward. The other 2 patients were managed by close observation for the mild hydronephrosis. Symptomatic bacteriuria developed in only 3 patients (5.7%) and responded well to antibiotic management. Reservoirography demonstrated no reflux into the upper urinary tract in all the follow-up patients. There was no significant change of the renal function at twenty-four months after operation detected by radionuclide (131I-Hippuran) renal functional study. All patients were satisfied with Kock urinary diversion.\r"

The study group consisted of 14 azoospermic men and 5 others who underwent testicular surgery unassociated with fertility problems. The findings for both studies were divided into three groups: normal, moderately abnormal, and markedly abnormal. Correlations between the findings from routine biopsy and flow cytometry were good. Of 9 patients having normal testicular morphology, 7 had normal ploidy classes by DNA flow cytometry while 2 had moderately abnormal histograms. Of 5 cases with moderately abnormal morphology, 1 had normal, 1 had moderately abnormal, and 3 had markedly abnormal ploidy distributions. In 5 cases described as Sertoli cell only, all DNA histograms were markedly abnormal, consisting almost exclusively of diploid cells. DNA flow cytometry of testicular biopsies and aspirates has been demonstrated to be a rapid, reproducible, and objective approach in evaluating the infertile male and is a promising method to investigate spermatogenesis in an outpatient clinic in lieu of formal testis biopsy.\r"

The opening and closing of this valve are believed to be regulated by the autonomic nervous system, especially through the release of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). We determined the content of VIP in cavernous tissue in 18 impotent patients and in 5 normal controls by radioimmunoassay, and we examined the distribution of VIP-ergic nerve fibers in cavernous tissue by an immunohistochemical method. As a result, it was found that the lower penile VIP content was more frequent among patients with organic impotence than among the controls. Furthermore, VIP-ergic nerve fibers were seen to be diffusely and loosely distributed in a large number of organic impotence patients. These findings suggest that organic impotence in some patients may be due to decreases in the VIP content and in VIP-ergic nerve fibers.\r"

This agent suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the proton pump mechanism, thereby blocking the final step of acid secretion. Omeprazole is significantly more effective than the histamine H2 receptor antagonists in eliminating acid secretion; thus, it may be beneficial in patients who are resistant to these agents. Omeprazole is indicated for severe erosive esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease that does not respond to H2 receptor antagonists, and hypersecretory diseases such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and systemic mastocytosis. Because of the theoretic risk of carcinogenesis, short-term therapy is recommended, although long-term therapy is required for hypersecretory diseases.\r"

Thirty-four culprit arteries were occluded (group A); 42 arteries were patent with residual stenosis of more than 70% (group B). Twenty-two patients had residual stenosis of less than 70% (group C); eight of these had severe disease of the remaining vessels. Group C patients were either treated conservatively or underwent bypass surgery. Immediate PTCA was attempted in 74 patients (32 in group A, 42 in group B) and was successful in 68 (92%). Emergency bypass surgery for acute occlusion after PTCA was required in two patients. Follow-up averaged 23 months (range, 16 to 47 months). Asymptomatic occlusion recurred in three patients. Restenosis occurred in five patients: four had early restenosis (one in group A, three in group B) and one had late restenosis (group B). These arteries were successfully redilated. Late reinfarction occurred in two patients. They were treated with intravenous urokinase and repeat PTCA. Elective bypass surgery was performed in three patients because of recurrent angina. They had severe three-vessel disease as revealed by control angiography. The mortality rate was 2.7% (two patients; one in group B had early reinfarction, and one patient in group A died suddenly after 17 months). Eighty-five percent of patients treated with PTCA alone remain free of symptoms. This approach has a high success rate and low morbidity and mortality rates. Long-term results are superior to thrombolysis alone.\r"

Of the 34 patients, 33 had abnormal stress tests before angioplasty. Angioplasty was successful in 31 patients (91%). Follow-up was 100% for a mean period of 36 +/- 15 months. Follow-up exercise test was normal or improved in 29 of the 31 patients who had successful angioplasty. Follow-up catheterization was performed in 24 of the 31 patients (77%). Restenosis of the previously dilated segment was found in seven patients. Actuarial cardiac survival at 3 years was 100%. Freedom from myocardial infarction, bypass surgery, angioplasty for a new lesion, and death was 87%. We conclude that although the most effective treatment for silent ischemia remains to be determined, our data suggest that coronary angioplasty is a therapeutic option in these patients.\r"

Direct in vivo evidence that oxidants cause systolic or diastolic dysfunction of viable myocardium has, however, been lacking. We sought to determine whether in vivo exposure of canine myocardium to exogenously generated reactive oxygen species could--in the absence of myocardial ischemia or necrosis--\"mimic\" the depressed systolic contractile function, paradoxical contraction during early diastole, and prolonged diastolic relaxation time characteristic of stunned myocardium. Anesthetized open-chest dogs were randomly assigned to receive either (1) the free radical generating substrates xanthine oxidase + purine + iron-saturated transferrin or (2) saline, infused directly into an anterior coronary vein. Infusion of free radical substrates did not cause ischemia: regional myocardial blood flow and myocardial high-energy phosphate stores were normal in both groups. Furthermore, infusion of xanthine oxidase + purine + transferrin was not associated with histologic or electron microscopic evidence of myocyte injury or death in this model. Xanthine oxidase + purine + transferrin did, however, produce marked abnormalities in regional systolic contractile function; at 2 hours after the onset of infusion, segment shortening (assessed by sonomicrometry) in the perfused region of the heart averaged 62 +/- 5% of baseline, preinfusion values in animals infused with free radical substrates versus 113 +/- 8% of baseline values in saline-administered control dogs (p less than 0.004). This systolic dysfunction was effectively reversed by administration of the free radical scavenging agents superoxide dismutase + catalase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Radionuclide ventriculograms were performed on all patients within 18 hours of chest pain and again at 10 days. In addition, 15 of 18 patients had rest and exercise radionuclide ventriculograms at 3 months. The mean resting right ventricular ejection fractions (RVEF) at admission, 10 days, and 3 months in these patients was 31.8 +/- 12.6% (SD), 46.9 +/- 11.2% (p less than 0.05), and 44.5 +/- 10.2% (p less than 0.05), while the left ventricular ejection fractions were 55.9 +/- 10.6%, 57.9 +/- 13.3%, and 53.1 +/- 11.2% (p = ns). The 3-month exercise radionuclide ventriculogram demonstrated an increase in RVEF greater than 5% in 6 of 15 patients. In eight catheterized patients, neither the location nor the severity of coronary artery narrowing nor the presence of collaterals correlated with the RV exercise response. Improvement in RV function over a 10-day interval following acute inferior myocardial infarction suggests the presence of significant reversible right ventricular dysfunction during the acute phase.\r"

One hundred and ninety-eight patients had no signs of right ventricular involvement (group I), whereas 45 patients had inferior myocardial infarction with right ventricular infarction (group II). Patients were divided into groups depending on the presence or absence of complete atrioventricular block during hospital stay (groups Ia and IIa without block and groups Ib and IIb with block). Selected clinical and laboratory variables were compared for each group. We found that patients with inferior myocardial infarction and complete atrioventricular block had significantly higher mortality rates only in the presence of right ventricular infarction: 41% mortality rate in group IIb versus 11% mortality rate in group Ib (p less than 0.05). Patients with right ventricular infarction but without complete atrioventricular block (group IIa) had a mortality rate similar to that found in patients with inferior myocardial infarction and no atrioventricular block (group Ia): 14% versus 11% (p = NS). In patients with inferior myocardial infarction without right ventricular involvement (group I), complete atrioventricular block did not influence survival: 14% mortality rate in group Ib versus 11% mortality rate in group Ia (p = NS). The excessively high mortality rate in patients who have inferior myocardial infarction with right ventricular involvement and complete atrioventricular block could be the consequence of greater infarct size, but the synergistic influence of right ventricular infarction and complete atrioventricular block could be the other factor that influences outcome.\r"

All patients with X syndrome had positive exercise stress response (more than 0.1 mV of ST segment depression). Duration of diastole expressed as percent of cardiac cycle was significantly shorter at the intermediate steps and at the peak of exercise in patients with X syndrome compared with normal subjects (p less than 0.05). When the relationship between heart rate and diastolic time was examined, an inverse nonlinear regression was found both in normal subjects and in patients with X syndrome. The exercise values of diastolic time observed in patients with X syndrome were significantly shorter than those predicted as normal diastolic time heart rate relation. Thus the patients with X syndrome demonstrated abnormalities in the decrement of diastolic time with exercise. We hypothesized that this disproportionate shortening, by reducing subendocardial blood flow, might induce a worsening of ischemic response to exercise.\r"

In this study myocardial uptake of 123I-HDA was compared with that of thallium-201 in six closed-chest dogs after 5 hours of occlusion followed by 1 hour of reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Myocardial blood flow was measured with microspheres, and myocardial viability was assessed by means of triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. In viable areas of the reperfused region, 123I-HDA uptake, thallium-201 uptake, and myocardial blood flow were similar to those measured in the control circumflex region. However, in infarcted areas they were reduced to 48 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.001), 59 +/- 3% (p less than 0.001), and 74 +/- 5% (p less than 0.001) of control values, respectively. Results of multiple regression analysis showed that thallium-201 uptake primarily reflected the level of flow during reperfusion, whereas 123I-HDA uptake was dependent on both myocardial blood flow and viability. At each level of flow, 123I-HDA uptake was significantly lower in infarcted than in viable myocardium. By means of discriminant analysis, 123I-HDA uptake was found to be the single most important predictor of viability, whereas thallium-201 was only of limited importance. Myocardial 123I-HDA uptake greater than or equal to 71% or myocardial thallium-201 uptake greater than or equal to 73% best differentiated viable from infarcted myocardium. According to these criteria, 123I-HDA predicted myocardial viability with a sensitivity of 77%, a specificity of 84% and a predictive accuracy of 81%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was totally occluded and dipyridamole (0.4 mg/kg) was intravenously infused over 4 minutes. 99mTc-sestamibi and 201Tl were coinjected intravenously and a set of microspheres (15 microns) labelled with 113Sn or 55Nb was injected via a left atrial cannula. Animals were put to death at different times after injection of 99mTc-sestamibi/201Tl and the left ventricle was sectioned for gamma spectroscopy. Regression analysis of regional myocardial distribution of 99mTc-sestamibi or 201Tl versus microsphere-determined RMBF demonstrated a linear relationship with flow up to 2.5 ml/min/gm. The myocardial uptake for both 99mTc-sestamibi and 201Tl at higher flow levels was shown not to follow a linear relationship to microsphere-determined RMBF. The first-pass myocardial extraction fractions (%EF) of 99mTc-sestamibi and 201Tl in dogs were 65.5 +/- 2.5% and 82 +/- 3%, respectively (p less than 0.001), at resting flow. At flow levels above the resting flow, a significant decrease in the first-pass extraction fraction for both tracers was shown. At hyperemic flow levels (two to three times the resting flow), the %EF for both tracers are not significantly different. These data provide a basic validation for the utility of 99mTc-sestamibi as a reliable myocardial perfusion imaging agent.\r"

Two additional patients received IS-5-MN at 16 mg/hr. Platelet aggregation and thromboxane (TX) B2 generation in response to various agonists, drug plasma concentrations, and blood pressure were monitored throughout the study. A significant decrease in platelet aggregation and TXB2 production by adenosine diphosphate and adrenaline occurred in seven of nine patients receiving IS-2-MN and in 7 of 11 patients receiving IS-5-MN. Response was dose related, with more patients responding at 8 mg/hr to IS-2-MN (five of five) than to IS-5-MN (three of five), and was maximum at the end of the infusion time, corresponding to peak plasma levels. Patients responding to drug infusions with an inhibition of platelet function were characterized by a greater vascular responsiveness compared to nonresponders, since the decrease in systolic blood pressure (mean +/- SEM) was significantly greater in the former (15.4 +/- 3.2) than in the latter (2.5 +/- 2.1, p less than 0.05). Therefore both mononitrates, when administered at infusion rates between 8 and 16 mg/hr, are accompanied by a consistent inhibition of adenosine diphosphate- and adrenaline-induced aggregation and TX generation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test this hypothesis, we performed programmed ventricular stimulation with three extrastimuli on nine patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and asymptomatic complex ventricular arrhythmias during a period of acute hemodynamic decompensation; programmed ventricular stimulation was then repeated following hemodynamic improvement with nitroprusside. These patients did not have a history of documented or suspected sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.21 +/- 0.04 (range 0.15 to 0.26). In the baseline state, mean right atrial pressure was 8 +/- 4 mm Hg, pulmonary artery wedge pressure was 20 +/- 3 mm Hg, and cardiac index was 3.2 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2. Following acute hemodynamic decompensation, mean right atrial pressure increased to 16 +/- 5 mm Hg and pulmonary artery wedge pressure to 33 +/- 8 mm Hg; cardiac index decreased to 2.1 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2. In this decompensated state, programmed ventricular stimulation failed to induce sustained or nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias in any patient. Following nitroprusside administration (mean dose 1.5 +/- 1.1 micrograms/kg/min), there were significant decreases in mean right atrial pressure (11 +/- 3 mm Hg) and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (16 +/- 3 mm Hg), and a significant increase in cardiac index (3.1 +/- 1.1 L/min/m2) (p less than 0.05 for all values versus the decompensated state).

  ".W": "It is well established that increasing degrees of heart failure are accompanied by a reduced density of myocardial beta-adrenoceptors. It is unclear, however, whether all beta-adrenoceptors in the cardiac cell membrane are coupled to the effector system or whether \"spare receptors\" or \"uncoupled\" beta-adrenoceptors also exist. To investigate this, we measured the density of beta-adrenoceptors and the positive inotropic response to isoprenaline in preparations from the same human hearts. The myocardium from nonfailing hearts had significantly (p less than 0.01) higher numbers of beta-adrenoceptors (104 +/- 7 fmol/mg protein) compared with tissue from moderately (mitral valve disease, New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II to III, 60 +/- 2.8 fmol/mg protein) and terminally (dilated cardiomyopathy, NYHA class IV, 35 +/- 2.7 fmol/mg protein) failing human hearts. The KD values of the drug-receptor complexes did not differ within the different patient groups. There was a linear relationship (r = 0.97) between the beta-adrenoceptor density measured and the maximally obtainable positive inotropic effect elicited by isoprenaline in the three groups tested. Thus there seem to be no spare beta-adrenoceptors, that is, receptors not required for the production of the maximal inotropic response in the left ventricular human myocardium, and there are no uncoupled beta-adrenoceptors. The beta-adrenoceptors associated with the plasma membrane (marker: 3H-ouabain binding sites) remained functionally active. In addition, these results indicate that either there is no amplifier system behind the receptor level or it remains unchanged in the failing left ventricular human myocardium under the conditions tested.\r"

  ".W": "The Doppler echocardiographic estimation of cardiac output at the mitral valve site is often underestimated in adults with slow heart rates because the mitral valve remains open in mid-diastole when flow is markedly reduced. Therefore we tested several approaches to this measurement in 17 adults with nonvalvular heart disease who had thermodilution catheters in the right side of the heart. Superior correlations with thermal output values were obtained by a new method that excludes mitral orifice measurements during mid-diastole when flow less than 10 cm/sec (r = 0.94) compared with the standard method (r = 0.89). Also, the new method resulted in significantly less underestimation of thermal cardiac output in patients with heart rates less than 70 beats/min (-10%) compared with the standard method (-34%). In addition, use of a constant maximal two-dimensional echocardiographic mitral orifice correction factor of 0.77 with the new method to account for variations in mitral valve orifice during the cardiac cycle, as opposed to 0.68 with the standard method, resulted in similar results as compared with determining individual correction factors from M-mode echoes. We conclude that: (1) the mitral orifice approach is accurate for measuring cardiac output in adult patients with nonvalvular heart disease; (2) a new method that excludes mid-diastolic mitral orifice measurements is superior to the standard method; and (3) use of a constant two-dimensional echocardiographic mitral valve orifice correction factor obviates the need for M-mode echoes.\r"

  ".W": "Standard evaluation of children with sinus node (SN) dysfunction cannot distinguish abnormal autonomic tone from intrinsic SN disease. This distinction has potentially important therapeutic and prognostic implications. Intrinsic heart rate (IHR)--the peak heart rate (HR) measured during pharmacologic combined autonomic blockade--reflects intrinsic SN function. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of IHR--and its relationship with resting heart rate (RHR)--in distinguishing autonomic influence from intrinsic SN disease among children with SN dysfunction. IHR was determined in the electrophysiology laboratory using intravenous propranolol, 0.2 mg/kg, followed by intravenous atropine, 0.04 mg/kg; the peak HR recorded was the IHR. IHR was measured in two groups. Seven control subjects, defined as patients with normal noninvasive SN testing, had IHR mean of 128 +/- 24 beats/min; this was greater than RHR mean of 89 +/- 16 beats/min (p less than 0.01). Eight patients with abnormal noninvasive SN testing had IHR mean of 103 +/- 6 beats/min; this was greater than RHR mean of 71 +/- 9 beats/min (p less than 0.01). We therefore reached the following conclusions. (1) Among this particular group of patients with abnormal noninvasive SN testing, IHR was consistently in the normal range for age and greater than RHR, suggesting that excess vagal tone can play a significant role in the expression of SN dysfunction. (2) Among normal individuals, IHR is age-related, decreasing with advancing age. IHR greater than RHR suggests that vagal tone predominates in the normal resting state as the net increase in HR during combined autonomic blockade is due to blockade of vagally mediated chronotropic inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At the pre-discharge point, 46% had right bundle branch block (RBBB) QRS morphology (QRS duration greater than or equal to 120 msec: 20 patients, less than 120 msec: 67 patients). This finding tended to be manifest on the first day following transplantation; its prevalence remained constant over 3 years of follow up. Rejection, ischemic time, preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance, and donor age were not associated with the presence of RBBB morphology. A subgroup of 46 consecutive patients (21 with RBBB morphology) underwent right-sided heart catheterization and radionuclide angiography prior to discharge. RBBB morphology was not associated with any hemodynamic abnormality at catheterization. Based on the radionuclide study, RBBB morphology was associated with a greater left anterior oblique angle required for the best visual separation of the ventricles during acquisition of the study (angle of interventricular septal plane to sagittal plane: 69 +/- 11 versus 59 +/- 9 degrees; p = 0.019), and with the presence of right ventricular dysfunction (13 of 21 versus 6 of 25 patients; p = 0.009). The high prevalence of RBBB morphology in heart transplant recipients appears to be related to posterior rotation of the long axis of the heart in the transverse plane, probably resulting from the surgical technique, and to right ventricular dysfunction.\r"

In the control group, after dipyridamole infusion, Doppler-derived parameters increased significantly from baseline (p less than 0.001). In patients with CAD, peak flow velocity, flow velocity integral and stroke volume failed to increase after dipyridamole infusion (0.89 +/- 0.21 to 0.85 +/- 0.18 m/s, difference not significant; 14 +/- 3 to 12 +/- 4 cm, difference not significant, and 56 +/- 13 to 50 +/- 14 ml/beat, p less than 0.05, respectively). Heart rate, rate pressure product, systemic vascular resistance and mean right atrial pressure had similar variations in the 2 groups. Changes in the 3 Doppler-derived parameters are closely related to the variations of peak positive dP/dt, stroke volume (thermodilution) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and are closely related to the coronary angiography jeopardy score and to the appearance of wall motion abnormalities. Thus, by combining Doppler and 2-dimensional echocardiography, dipyridamole-induced myocardial ischemia may be detected in a high percentage of CAD patients, providing a sensitive tool for identifying patients with high-risk coronary artery anatomy.\r"

Primary PTCA success was obtained in 30 (91%) patients and no major complications occurred. Angiographic evaluation was performed either for symptoms or for protocol (7 +/- 1 months after PTCA) in 28 (93%) of the 30 patients with successful PTCA, but 2 patients (7%) who were asymptomatic refused the repeat angiogram. Twenty (71%) had no restenosis and 8 (29%) had restenosis. Of these, 5 patients with restenosis underwent a successful repeat PTCA (6 +/- 1 months after the initial procedure). At the last clinical follow-up (17 +/- 8 months), 2 of the 30 (7%) patients successfully dilated presented with stable angina despite medical treatment, whereas the rest (93%) remained asymptomatic. During the study period no patient died, had an AMI or required coronary artery bypass grafting. Thus, selected patients with ischemia after a non-Q-wave AMI, a \"high-risk population,\" can be effectively treated with PTCA with an initial success rate and angiographic restenosis rate similar to that of the general PTCA population and appear to have sustained symptomatic benefit remaining free of subsequent cardiac events.\r"

Doppler LV filling indexes included isovolumic relaxation time, mitral deceleration time, E/A peak velocity ratio and atrial filling fraction. Eighteen aged-matched control subjects served to establish normal values for comparison. Before PTCA, both groups exhibited abnormal diastolic function demonstrated by prolonged isovolumic relaxation time and mitral deceleration time, decreased E/A ratio and increased atrial filling fraction. After PTCA isovolumic relaxation time and deceleration time decreased 18 +/- 28 (p less than 0.005) and 33 +/- 43 ms (p less than 0.002) in the unstable angina group and 18 +/- 23 (p less than 0.003) and 14 +/- 34 ms (difference not significant), respectively, in the post-AMI ischemia group.

The patency of the infarct-related vessel was assessed by coronary angiography. At 58 +/- 9 hours after infarction MRI was performed before and after bolus injection of 0.1 mmol/kg gadolinium-DTPA. Myocardial signal intensities were measured using a circumferential profile. Normal and infarcted myocardium showed a maximum signal intensity enhancement of 35 and 66%, respectively. Signal intensity of infarcted relative to normal myocardium (I/N) increased from 1.06 +/- 0.16 before to a maximum of 1.39 +/- 0.13 after gadolinium-DTPA (p less than 0.001), whereas the contrast between normal myocardium and a pseudo-infarct region in 2 healthy volunteers did not change. Between patients with reperfused infarct-related vessels and occluded vessels without collaterals, maximum I/N did not differ. However, observing I/N as a function of time after injection of gadolinium-DTPA, the reperfusion group differed from the occlusion group on images acquired directly after injection (1.29 +/- 0.10 vs 1.14 +/- 0.05, p less than 0.02). Thus, gadolinium-DTPA enhanced the visualization of acute myocardial infarction on relatively longitudinal (T1)-weighted MR images and its dynamics seem of potential value for the noninvasive assessment of coronary artery reperfusion after thrombolysis.\r"

Standard and modified off-axis 2-dimensional echocardiographic views from parasternal, apical and subcostal windows correctly identified this defect in 14 of the 15 patients. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography confirmed the presence of left-to-right-sided shunt by showing a high-velocity, aliased, systolic flow and a low-velocity diastolic flow in the right ventricle in 14 patients. Continuous wave Doppler echocardiography showed a high-velocity systolic and low-velocity diastolic flow signal of left-to-right shunt in 14 patients. Color flow Doppler imaging identified a left-to-right shunt in all 6 patients in whom it was performed. Doppler and 2-dimensional echocardiographic studies missed a small apical septal defect in 1 patient with anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Two-dimensional echocardiography correctly diagnosed right ventricular infarction in all 5 patients with posteroinferior infarction. Ventricular septal rupture and/or left-to-right-sided shunt was confirmed in all 15 patients by the following: surgical inspection in 11, necropsy in 3, left ventricular cineangiography in 5 and right-sided heart catheterization and oximetry data in 13 patients. Data indicate that 2-dimensional echocardiography correctly shows the precise location of septal rupture in most patients after acute myocardial infarction and allows assessment of left and right ventricular infarction and function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although computerized mapping has enabled the intraoperative delineation of global ventricular activation from a single complex of ventricular tachycardia (VT), beat-to-beat reproducibility of isochronic maps has not been defined. To determine the reliability of single-beat analysis, epicardial and transmural ventricular electrograms during 6 consecutive VT cycles were analyzed in 10 patients during intraoperative mapping of sustained monomorphic VT. Bipolar electrograms were recorded simultaneously using sock and needle electrodes from up to 96 epicardial and 156 transmural sites. In each patient, at each electrode site, local activation time, electrogram duration and morphology were compared over 6 consecutive beats. A total of 9,816 electrograms were analyzed. For each patient, the isochronic activation map during VT was reproducible. Mean beat-to-beat variations in local epicardial and transmural activation times were only 1.7 +/- 1.7 and 2.04 +/- 1.9 ms, respectively (difference not significant). Moreover, electrogram duration did not vary significantly. Mean variations in epicardial and transmural electrogram durations were 2.1 +/- 1.8 and 1.4 +/- 1.9 ms, respectively (difference not significant). There were only 2 instances of 2:1 conduction failure; both occurred intramurally and adjacent to a site of VT origin. Thus, transmural ventricular activation during sustained monomorphic VT is reproducible regardless of electrode site or electrogram duration. These results demonstrate that analysis of a single beat of VT is a reliable and expedient method to delineate ventricular activation during intraoperative computerized mapping for the purpose of clinical decision-making in patients with sustained monomorphic VT.\r"

In 12 patients atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction delay or block was induced without preexcitation after adenosine (first-degree AV block in 8, second-degree block in 4): at subsequent electrophysiologic study none of these patients was found to have latent preexcitation. Five patients had little or no PR prolongation in response to adenosine: of these, 2 were shown to have latent preexcitation at electrophysiologic study. Atrial fibrillation was induced in 1 patient and a narrow complex regular tachycardia in another after intravenous adenosine. Intravenous adenosine during sinus rhythm is capable of producing AV nodal conduction delay or block in 73% of patients with a history of supraventricular tachycardia: in these patients adenosine provides a diagnostic test that is both 100% sensitive and 100% specific for latent preexcitation. In those patients in whom adenosine does not produce AV conduction delay or block, further investigation is required to establish or refute the diagnosis of latent preexcitation.\r"

Of 224 patients undergoing mitral valve repair 12 (5.4%) had electrocardiographic and cardiac enzyme evidence of perioperative AMI develop. Of 111 patients undergoing mitral valve replacement none had perioperative AMI develop as determined by electrocardiographic and enzyme criteria (p = 0.01). All 12 infarctions after valve repair involved the inferior wall by electrocardiographic or echocardiographic criteria. Although no patient had significant clinical difficulty in recovery, 7 of the 12 patients (58%) were left with Q waves upon hospital discharge. The etiology of the AMI is believed to be air emboli introduced at the time of testing valve competence during left ventricular insufflation under pressure. Changes in surgical technique may reduce or eliminate this complication.\r"

The purpose of this study was to confirm morphologically the radiographic appearance of anomalous coronary arteries and to construct a protocol for rapid determination of their true course. Twenty-one adults who had anomalous origin of coronary arteries without other evidence of congenital heart disease were reviewed. Using an anatomically correct model of the heart, solder wire was placed in the pathologically described anomalous positions and radiographed. With this model the pathologically described courses could be easily recognized and separated radiographically. These courses were confirmed in the operating room in 2 patients and a rare anomaly of posterior origin of a coronary artery was also confirmed by autopsy.\r"

Each subject performed submaximal and symptom-limited maximal supine bicycle exercise 1 hour apart after ingestion of placebo or caffeine (3.3 mg/kg). Heart rate, BP, cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance were compared for placebo and caffeine days. Postdrug baseline showed that caffeine increased systolic and diastolic BP and peripheral vascular resistance (p less than 0.001 for each) and decreased heart rate (p less than 0.01) but did not change stroke volume or cardiac output. BP and vascular resistance effects of caffeine remained during submaximal exercise resulting in an additive increase in BP while negative chronotropic effects of caffeine disappeared. At maximal exercise substantially more subjects (15 on caffeine vs 7 on placebo, p less than 0.02) had systolic BP greater than or equal to 230 mm Hg and/or greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg for diastolic BP. Plasma norepinephrine levels were not significantly different across days, but epinephrine was higher at maximal exercise and cortisol was increased post-drug and throughout maximal exercise on caffeine days. Data indicate that caffeine increases BP additively during submaximal exercise and may cause excessive BP responses at maximal exercise for some individuals. The pressor effects of caffeine appear to be due to increasing vascular resistance rather than cardiac output.\r"

  ".W": "Ventricular pump function can be quantified by the inverse relation between pressure and output, i.e., the pump function graph, which is obtained by varying arterial load without changing end-diastolic volume, inotropic state and heart rate. The ratio of pressure and output, i.e., the peripheral resistance, can be represented in the same graph by a line through the origin. The 2 pressure-output relations intersect in the working point, i.e., the pressure and flow at the prevailing steady state. In normal, anesthetized cats the ventricle appears to be matched to the arterial load in the sense that the working point is found at the optimal power, i.e., the optimal value of the product of pressure and output along the pump function graph. To maintain this matching criterion during pressure overload, the ventricular volume has to remain the same while thickening of the wall takes place: concentric hypertrophy. With volume overload, matching would be preserved with eccentric hypertrophy. Because volume and pressure overloads typically lead to eccentric and concentric hypertrophy, respectively, the matching criterion may be a valuable predictor of the geometric changes found with changes in load. This idea was further investigated experimentally by determining the position of the working point in the perinephritic cat that had 1 kidney removed and the other wrapped in cellophane for 15 to 26 weeks. The working point was no longer found at the optimal power, indicating that either matching was permanently comprised or that the ventricle was still trying to restore matching.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary hemodynamics (coronary blood flow, coronary reserve, myocardial oxygen consumption) were analyzed in both experimental and clinical essential hypertension. Significant reduced coronary reserve was found in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Extracoronary reasons for these phenomena were ruled out. Considerable thickening of the coronary resistance vessels (medial hypertrophy) in hypertensive hypertrophy associated with a marked increase in the wall thickness/radius ratio was considered sufficient to explain the impairment of coronary flow. After long-term pharmacotherapy there was normalization of both medial hypertrophy and coronary reserve. This small-vessel abnormality correlates well with clinical findings in hypertensive heart disease (angina and electrocardiographic changes despite normal coronary arteriogram). Moreover, this structural adaptation of the small vessels may carry the inherent risk of an impaired oxygen supply to the hypertrophied myocardium. Thus, late cardiac failure of the hypertrophied heart in hypertension may be attributed, in part, to this microcirculation disorder. Conversely, reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy and of hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle by specific pharmacotherapy can be considered a possible approach to the rational prevention of cardiac failure in hypertensive patients. For future investigations, controlled clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings with regard to prevention of heart failure, and pharmacotherapeutic studies are necessary to define the optimal drug regimen for reversal of vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy.\r"

Therefore, the prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias, identified on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, was analyzed in 54 patients (aged 56 +/- 10 years) with arterial hypertension and normal coronary angiograms with respect to left ventricular muscle mass, mass-to-volume ratio, systolic wall stress and coronary microangiopathy. Ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs) were assessed according to a score (modified Lown classification: 1 = no VEB, 2 = less than 30 VEB/hour, 3 = greater than 30 VEB/hour, 4 = polymorphic VEB, 5 = bigeminys, 6 = couplets, 7 = nonsustained ventricular tachycardia). Coronary blood flow was measured by the gas chromatographic argon method. Coronary reserve was determined by measuring coronary resistance before (Rcor) and after (Rmin) administration of intravenous dipyridamole (0.5 mg/kg body weight) (Cor Res = Rcor/Rmin). The frequency (p less than 0.05) and severity (p less than 0.025) of VEBs was higher in normotensive than in hypertensive patients. Although the score of VEBs did not correlate with left ventricular muscle mass (r = 0.20, difference not significant), a slight correlation with mass-to-volume ratio (r = 0.32; p less than 0.05) and systolic wall stress (r = 0.30; p less than 0.05) was found. Hypertensives with a severely reduced Cor Res (less than 2.0) had a significantly higher score of VEBs than those with a nearly normal Cor Res (greater than 3.0) (5.0 +/- 1.5 vs 3.5 +/- 1.7; p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

ST-segment analysis during 24-hour Holter electrocardiography was determined in 48 patients (24 men and 24 women, mean age 54.6 +/- 10.4 years) with essential arterial hypertension (systolic/diastolic blood pressure 189.7 +/- 29/99.5 +/- 15 mm Hg). The thickness of left ventricular posterior wall and septum were measured with echocardiography. Stenosis of coronary vessels were excluded on angiography in all patients. In 24 of 48 patients, 12.8 +/- 13.8 episodes of transient myocardial ischemia (ST-segment depression greater than or equal to 1 mm, duration of the episode greater than or equal to 1 minute) were observed. The duration of the episodes was 48.1 +/- 69.93 minutes and the maximal ST-segment depression was 1.91 +/- 0.82 mm. In 95% of the episodes the patients did not experience any angina pectoris. The degree of left ventricular wall thickness did not differ in hypertensive patients with and without transient myocardial ischemia (septum thickness 11 +/- 2 mm). It is concluded that transient myocardial ischemia often occurs in hypertensive patients. Thus, left ventricular hypertrophy does not appear to play any important role. The underlying cause appears to be the impaired coronary dilation capacity, i.e., vascular alterations.\r"

When the hypertensive group was further divided according to the coronary reserve (less than 2.5, severely impaired coronary reserve; greater than 2.5 less than 3.8, moderately impaired coronary reserve), the parameters of blood fluidity clearly correlated inversely with coronary reserve. This suggests a major importance of rheologic abnormalities on impaired coronary reserve in hypertensive patients.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nisoldipine on vascular smooth muscle and myocardium were investigated by brachial artery infusions and measurements of forearm blood flow and by intracoronary infusions and measurements of maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (dP/dtmax). Brachial artery infusions (0.1 to 16 micrograms/min/1,000 ml tissue) in 10 patients with essential hypertension increased forearm blood flow and decreased calculated forearm vascular resistance dose dependently (maximal reduction of forearm vascular resistance 88%). A comparison with the vascular effects of verapamil indicated that the vasodilator potency of nisoldipine is approximately 40- to 50-fold greater in this model supporting similar results from in vitro experiments. Coronary artery infusions of nisoldipine (12, 24 and 48 micrograms over 3 minutes each) in 9 patients undergoing diagnostic left-sided cardiac catheterization did not change dP/dtmax. This lack of effect on left ventricular contractility was similar in patients with normal or impaired left ventricular function. Even though the coronary artery concentrations during the infusion are unknown, the highest intracoronary dose was comparable to the highest brachial artery infusion. Since the coronary vasculature has been found to be at least as sensitive to nisoldipine as the peripheral vasculature, it can be assumed that nisoldipine has no negative inotropic effect even in dosages that probably induced marked vasodilation. Thus, for nisoldipine and possibly other new dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, the concept of a dissociation between peripheral vasodilatation and direct myocardial effects also seems to apply to human circulation and the heart.\r"

  ".W": "There is substantial evidence that the failing heart is in an energy-depleted state. The imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand might be the cause for adaptive metabolic changes seen in patients with severe chronic heart failure. By analyzing the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzyme pattern, an increase of LDH5 and a decrease of LDH1 was seen in myocardium from patients with chronic heart failure. Additionally, the concentration of the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) carrier was significantly elevated. After treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in 33 patients with chronic heart failure, LDH1 increased from 38.7 +/- 6.7 to 42.3 +/- 5.5 (p less than 0.005), paralleled by a decrease in LDH5 from 20.8 +/- 7.0 to 15.8 +/- 4.7 (p less than 0.001). The ADP/ATP carrier concentration also decreased significantly within the normal range. There was a good correlation between the hemodynamic data and the LDH isoenzyme pattern. The shift of the LDH isoenzyme pattern and the decrease of the ADP/ATP concentration can be taken as an indication for an improvement of the myocardial energy balance in chronic heart failure with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The heat generated by right ventricular papillary muscles of rabbits was measured after adenosine triphosphate (ATP) splitting by the contractile proteins was chemically inhibited. This tension-independent heat (TIH) (1 mJ/g wet weight) was used to calculate the total calcium (Ca) cycled in a muscle twitch by assuming that 87% of TIH was due to Ca2+ transport by the sarcoplasmic reticulum with a coupling ratio of 2 Ca2+/ATP split; the enthalpy of creatine phosphate hydrolysis buffering ATP was taken as -34 KJ/mol. The estimated Ca turnover per muscle twitch at 21 degrees C, 0.2 Hz pacing rate, and 2.5 mM Ca in the Krebs solution was approximately equal to 50 nmol/g wet weight. There was a tight positive correlation between TIH and mechanical activation during steady-state measurements but no correlation during the sharp increase in mechanical activation (treppe) when stimulation was resumed after a rest period. It is suggested that while total Ca cycling remains unchanged during the initial period of tension treppe, the free Ca2+ transient and mechanical activation increase sharply due to resaturation of high affinity Ca2+ buffers, other than troponin C, depleted of Ca2+ during the rest period.\r"

EPA and DHA increased from 0% of total adipose tissue fatty acid, in the adipose tissue of control rabbits to 2.2% and 4.9%, respectively, in MaxEPA-fed rabbits. The DHA-to-EPA ratio in the adipose tissue was higher than that in the diet, indicating alternative metabolic pathways for EPA. In the adipose tissue of herring-oil-fed rabbits, cetoleic acid increased from 0% to 7.9% of total fatty acids. The deposition of EPA and DHA was 1.8% and 2.8%, respectively. Our data indicated that these unique long-chain unsaturated fatty acids from dietary fish oils were readily incorporated into the fat stores from whence they could be mobilized.\r"

He also showed how to compute the exponent for a power-type weight-height index that would be approximately equivalent to this relative weight. Benn did not, however, recommended that this \"Benn index\" be used instead of relative weight. The properties of these two weight-height functions were investigated in data on 10,606 white men and women aged 18-74 y examined in the 1976-1980 Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II). Compared with the power-type index, relative weight was preferable in that it was easier to compute with current software packages, was invariant at standard weight-for-height, and offered more flexibility. The limitations shared by both functions are discussed. Neither function should be used uncritically.\r"

TOBEC predicted FFM (FFMT) was consistently higher than either FFMd or FFMdw for both men and women in all age groups. A theoretical calculation of percent body fat was performed with a three-component model with body density, total body water, and bone mineral content. The recalculation of fat was used to estimate a new FFM (FFMnew). These calculations resulted in a decrease in fat and an increase in FFMnew. Because the TOBEC signal is unaffected by bone mineralization, FFMT may provide a more accurate estimation of body composition than do FFMd or FFMdw in this group of individuals.\r"

Cholestyramine-treated rats demonstrated significant functional and histological protection. Recurrent proteinuria was significantly lower in PA/resin animals. Whole-kidney glomerular filtration rate in the PA/resin group was preserved at a level equivalent to normal age-matched control rats whereas the PA/cell group had a significantly lower value than did the normal animals. The extent of segmental glomerulosclerosis 24 wk after PA delivery was significantly lower in the PA/resin group.

Glutamine transport represented uptake into an osmotically active intravesicular space without significant metabolism. Glutamine uptake was temperature- and pH-dependent with maximal uptake at pH 7.5, and it was mediated by sodium-dependent and -independent processes. The initial rate of uptake was linear up to 20 s, as depicted by the formula gamma (nmol/mg protein) = 0.0009 X (s) - 0.0011 (r = 0.99). Kinetic analysis of glutamine uptake at concentrations between 0.01 and 0.3 mmol/L at 5 s under sodium and potassium gradients showed a maximal transport capacity (Vmax) of 0.39 +/- 0.04 and 0.21 +/- 0.02 nmol.mg protein-1.5 s-1 for sodium-dependent and -independent processes, respectively (p less than 0.01). Km values were 0.17 +/- 0.04 and 0.06 +/- 0.2 mmol/L, respectively (p less than 0.05). Glutamine uptake under the sodium-gradient condition was electrogenic whereas under the potassium-gradient it was electroneutral. Neutral amino acids inhibited both sodium-dependent and -independent processes.

Three indices of copper status, urinary copper, and salivary copper were determined at intervals throughout the study. Neither copper status, urinary copper, nor salivary copper differed among MPs. Sweat collections from three subjects suggested that losses of copper through sweat were very low and would not contribute significantly to copper balance. These results suggest that an amount of dietary copper slightly less than 0.8 mg/d is adequate to maintain copper status for greater than or equal to 42 d in normal, healthy men and that neither urinary nor salivary copper is affected by the amount of Cu in the diet.\r"

  ".W": "A study was conducted on a cohort of 476 women (364 black, 112 white), who attended the Jefferson County Health Department clinic for their prenatal care, to ascertain the relationship between maternal serum zinc concentration measured early in pregnancy and birth weight. For all subjects maternal serum zinc was significantly related to birth weight after various independent determinants of birth weight were controlled for. The data in this study indicate a threshold for maternal serum zinc concentration below which the prevalence of low birth weight increases significantly. Pregnant women who had serum zinc concentrations in the lowest quartile had significantly higher prevalence of low birth weight than did those mothers who had serum zinc concentrations in the upper three quartiles during pregnancy. These findings suggest that maternal serum zinc concentration measured early in pregnancy could be used to identify those women at higher risk of giving birth to a low-birth-weight infant.\r"

Mean daily energy intake averaged 9058 and 11,591 kJ for women and men, respectively; 53.8% of the energy was from carbohydrates. Mean intakes of vitamins and most minerals exceeded the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), but many had intakes below RDAs for some nutrients; greater than 60% had low zinc and copper intakes. Because 39% took a daily multivitamin-mineral supplement, some had intakes 200-600% above the RDA. Although there were notable misconceptions about nutrition, nutrition knowledge was high. Upper-gastrointestinal complaints, reported by 50%, included bloating and abdominal gas; the incidence of positive hemoccult slides was 27%. The relation among performance, dietary patterns, nutrition knowledge, and gastrointestinal function remains to be established.\r"

Fifteen patients presented with stage II, 59 with stage III, and 14 with stage IV disease. Ten neoplasms were composed of only TCC, 48 were predominantly TCC, and 30 had foci of TCC but the predominant component was serous, endometrioid, undifferentiated, or unclassified adenocarcinoma. After the primary resection of the neoplasm, 76 patients received chemotherapy, 4 received chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and 5 received radiotherapy only; 2 refused further treatment and 1 patient died immediately after the first operation. Estimated five-year survival rates were 37% for the entire group and 41% for those who received chemotherapy. Favorable prognostic indicators, statistically significant, were low clinical stage, predominant TCC in the primary tumor, and a negative second-look operation. Other prognostic indicators were the amount of residual tumor after the first operation and tumor differentiation. When the primary neoplasm was predominantly TCC, another prognostic indicator was the type of carcinoma present in the metastases. Five-year follow-up shows that 56% of the patients whose metastases were predominantly TCC have no evidence of disease, whereas only 7% of the patients whose metastases are predominantly non-TCC are disease-free. The authors' study indicates that ovarian carcinomas containing predominant TCC pattern have an excellent response to different chemotherapy regimens. Tumor recurrences and lack of response to chemotherapy are often associated with a change in the histologic appearance of the metastatic lesion.\r"

The authors evaluated the immunoreactivity of B72.3 to benign, hyperplastic prostate, and to primary adenocarcinoma of the prostate to determine the frequency of TAG-72 production by benign and malignant prostatic epithelium. Focal cytoplasmic staining of gland cells was seen in 19 of 20 cases of glandular hyperplasia, and weak, homogeneous staining of secretions was seen in five cases. In contrast, 27 of the 35 (77%) adenocarcinomas studied showed at least focal intense staining of secretions, and 30 (86%) of the tumors showed some cytoplasmic immunostaining with B72.3. Positive staining occurred in all of the well-differentiated adenocarcinomas (100%) but was seen less often in moderately differentiated (82%) and poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas (58%). Because benign gland cells may express the TAG-72 antigen, immunohistochemistry results must be interpreted with caution and with regard to the overall morphologic pattern. Nonetheless, a positive B72.3 immunostain may be useful in identifying adenocarcinoma of the prostate, especially when an intense luminal reaction is found. A negative stain does not exclude the presence of adenocarcinoma, however.\r"

The 30-year survival rate corrected for intercurrent deaths was 75%, and no deaths of breast cancer occurred after the nineteenth year of follow-up. The 30-year crude survival rate was only 28%, indicating that the great majority of these patients ultimately die of other causes than breast cancer. The nuclear DNA content could be determined by flow cytometry in 95 of the 115 cases, and 52 (55%) of them were nondiploid. DNA ploidy (diploid vs. nondiploid, P = 0.11) did not have a significant influence on long-term survival rate, but cancers with the DNA index less than 1.2 had more favorable prognosis in a univariate analysis than those with the DNA index more than 1.2 (P = 0.02). The most important independent prognostic factor in Cox's multivariate analysis was the presence of lymphatic vessel invasion of cancer cells (P less than 0.001). Several other factors, including histologic grade and type, extent of necrosis, type of tumor margin, age at diagnosis, and primary tumor size could be shown to be of prognostic value in univariate and/or multivariate analyses.\r"

Traditional histopathologic parameters and the patients' clinical outcome with a minimum follow-up period of at least five years were also analyzed. Of all the variables examined, DNA ploidy, proliferative index, number of mitoses, and tumor margin were significantly associated with an adverse clinical course. Multivariate regression analysis of the authors' data showed that DNA content was a significant predictor of the patients' clinical outcome. The authors conclude that the DNA ploidy study is a useful, objective adjunct to the clinicopathologic assessment of cystosarcoma phyllodes of the breast.\r"

  ".U": "90209967\r", 
  ".W": "Interstitial pneumonia after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is frequently associated with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. However, in a considerable proportion of the cases, no infectious agent can be determined and the interstitial pneumonia is then classified as idiopathic. Hypothetically, idiopathic interstitial pneumonia could be caused by HCMV present in such small amounts or such conformation that the virus cannot be detected by routine histopathologic analysis or viral culture techniques. To check this hypothesis, three sensitive methods for HCMV detection (in situ hybridization, the polymerase chain reaction for HCMV-DNA detection, and immunohistochemistry for the detection of HCMV immediate early antigens) have been applied on lung tissue sections of bone marrow transplant patients who died with interstitial pneumonia. Three categories were distinguished: (1) patients with HCMV-related interstitial pneumonia (n = 5); (2) patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (n = 10); and (3) patients with HCMV interstitial pneumonia who had been treated with antiviral therapy (n = 2). In the first category, all three techniques yielded clearly positive results, whereas these techniques indicated that one of the patients of the second category had HCMV-related pneumonia. In the third category no positive signals could be obtained. The presented data indicate that a direct involvement of HCMV in idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is unlikely. However, a PCR performed for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was positive in two patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. These data indicate that the introduction of new sensitive techniques such as in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and the polymerase chain reaction revives the interest for HCMV and other causative infectious agents in idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.\r"

Five cases with T-ALL, four with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LL), and seven with peripheral T-cell lymphomas were positive for beta F1. None showed positive reactivity for delta TCS1. One case with T-LL and four cases with peripheral T-cell lymphomas were positive for WT31. Of the nine cases positive for beta F1 among T-ALLs and T-LLs, six were also positive for CD1 (OKT6), whereas six of seven positive cases for CD1 were positive for beta F1. The authors therefore suggest that TCR beta is expressed in the immature T-cells just earlier than or around the same stage of differentiation as those expressing CD1. The authors' immuno-electron microscopy study revealed that positive reactivity for beta F1 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells in the cases with T-ALL, T-LL and peripheral T-cell lymphomas, and in the cytoplasm of the reactive T-cells. However, it was not localized on the surface membrane. In contrast, positive reactivity for WT31 was localized on the surface membrane of the neoplastic and reactive T-cells. Only half of the cases of peripheral T-cell lymphomas showed positive reactivity for WT31. The authors consider that it may not be a very useful antibody for the detection of TCR alpha beta on the T-cell neoplasms using frozen tissue sections.\r"

All cases were previously classified according to the French-American-British (FAB) Co-operative Group, and cases of ALL were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. Results indicated that myeloid-associated antibodies (Mac 387, KP 1 [CD68], antielastase, antilactoferrin, and antilysozyme) did not react with any case of ALL, M1-AML, or M6-AML, whereas at least one of these antibodies reacted with 20 of 21 (95%) cases of M2, M3, M4, and M5-AML. Anti-glycophorin C marked cases of M6-AML, whereas anti-CD3 labeled T-cell ALL. None of the antibodies tested specifically identified cases of B-cell ALL.

Organisms visualized on the Wright-stained peripheral smears included Histoplasma capsulatum (two), Candida sp. (four), Plasmodium sp. (three), and Staphylococcus sp. (four). Two patients had a diagnosis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); intravascular catheters were present in five other patients. In all cases the leukocyte histograms were abnormal. The instrument flagged abnormalities of the R1 region in four patients and multiple regions in nine patients. Similar flags were produced by the in vitro addition of bacteria or fungi to whole blood. These studies document that the presence of microorganisms in the peripheral blood can result in spurious white blood cell (WBC) counts or electronic differentials. The authors' findings indicate that the possibility of circulating organisms should be considered when abnormal WBC flags are detected with Coulter instrumentation.\r"

In this survey of 5,336 donors, the authors report the impact of using both of these surrogate tests on a heterogeneous donor population that was composed of white, black, Hispanic, and Asian donors. Hispanic and male donors had relatively high ALT levels, and black and Asian donors had a higher prevalence of anti-HBc than their respective counterparts. The overall impact of using both surrogate tests resulted in a discard rate of 12.1% with a disproportionately high percentage of Hispanic and male donors excluded because of ALT testing and black and Asian donors because of anti-HBc testing. It appears that surrogate testing has a much greater impact on blood collection facilities that rely considerably on Hispanic, Asian, black, or male donors than those that largely draw white or female donors.\r"

Ristocetin also will induce conductivity changes in an impedance aggregometer with either fresh whole blood or fresh platelet-rich plasma due to aggregate attachment to the electrical probe. Formaldehyde-fixed platelets, however, do not attach, and although fresh platelets agglutinate at extremes of pH, probe adhesion does not occur unless the pH is within a certain range. Incubation of platelet preparations with neuraminidase, colchicine, or cytochalasin-b affects neither aggregate formation nor probe adherence. Incubation of platelet preparations with a fibronectin tetrapeptide inhibitor eliminates aggregate formation in response to collagen but is without effect on ristocetin-induced attachment of aggregates to the impedance probe. It is suggested that the ability of platelet aggregates to attach to an impedance probe in response to ristocetin is dependent on additional aspects of the functional integrity of platelet preparations and that these changes required for probe adherence may have in vivo significance.\r"

To avoid tautology, the nature of these was confirmed by immunostaining for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and factor VIII-related antigen (FVII RAg). It was found that mean nuclear AgNOR counts in the stromal and endothelial cells of HBl exceeded significantly the counts in the tumor and endothelial cells of RCC, with no overlap in values. It is suggested that the AgNOR method is a useful adjunct in achieving the differential diagnosis of HBl and RCC in the nervous system.\r"

Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) is present in highest amounts in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney, which are considered to be the site of origin for renal cell carcinomas. A retrospective study of 63 patients who had serum GGTP levels tested within 10 days before the resection of a renal cell carcinoma was performed to determine whether serum GGTP was elevated in low stage (stages I and II) renal cell carcinomas. Only 5 of the 63 patients had elevated GGTP levels (two of which were only slightly elevated). The authors conclude that serum GGTP levels as routinely measured in clinical laboratories are not reliably elevated in low stage renal cell carcinomas.\r"

The authors here report a case of reactive lymph node hyperplasia in which prominent aggregates of PTCs were present and a distinct cell population with an immunophenotype characteristic of PTCs was identified by flow cytometry. Aside from the recognition of PTCs, this observation is important so that cell suspensions showing a distinct population of PTCs with an \"aberrant\" T-cell phenotype are not misinterpreted as providing evidence for a T-cell neoplasm.\r"

The authors report a case of pulmonary blastomycosis, confirmed by culture and direct immunofluorescence, in which some of the yeast-like cells were abnormally large. These giant yeast-like cells exceeded the size range accepted for the tissue forms of B. dermatitidis; therefore, coccidioidomycosis was considered initially in the differential diagnosis. Otherwise characteristic morphologic features of these cells, in particular multinucleation and the production of broad-based blastoconidia, helped resolve the differential diagnosis. The diagnosis can be confirmed by direct immunofluorescence or microbiologic culture.\r"

The diagnosis was confirmed after postmortem analysis of skin and aorta showed less than 5% type III collagen (normal greater than 15%). Extensive literature review failed to find any other reported cases of sudden death in infancy due to intracranial hemorrhage in patients with previously unsuspected type IV EDS.

Physical findings revealed 21 patients (84%) with some degree of altered consciousness and 25 patients (100%) with nuchal rigidity. In all instances, the cerebrospinal fluid exhibited pleocytosis with a predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Eleven patients (44%) were afebrile on presentation. Of 22 surviving patients, 10 (45%) were afebrile without subsequent fever after administration of the initial dose of antibiotics, in 5 (23%) fever resolved within 24 hours, and in 6 (27%) fever resolved within 48 hours of treatment; there was no instance of prolonged or secondary fever noted. Death occurred in 3 cases (12%). Bacterial meningitis is uncommon in older children. As compared with younger children, older children with bacterial meningitis commonly present without fever and tend to have their fever resolve shortly after effective antibiotic therapy is initiated without manifesting prolonged or secondary fever patterns. Haemophilus influenzae type b is a common cause of bacterial meningitis in children aged 6 years or older; empirical antibiotic therapy in this clinical situation should include treatment of this pathogen.\r"

The initial screening failed to detect sickle cell anemia in 4 infants, but the hemoglobinopathy in 3 of these infants was diagnosed correctly by routine retesting of those with suspected sickle cell trait. A total of 47 infants with sickle cell diseases were followed through September 1989. There was no mortality among these infants. The screening test identified 3779 infants (1:140 births) with a suspected hemoglobin trait; confirmatory retesting was obtained in 53%. The results of our experience confirm the value of newborn screening for hemoglobinopathies but suggest that a more sensitive test would improve the program.\r"

Both groups were telephoned 6 weeks post partum to determine the method of infant feeding then, and those still breast-feeding were contacted monthly until complete weaning had occurred. No significant difference in breast-feeding duration between the two groups was noted. There was no association between duration of nursing and race, marital status, or the need to return to work or school. Earlier age at introduction of supplement, younger maternal age, and participation in prenatal classes predicted breast-feeding duration by logistic regression.\r"

Binge eating (24%) and fasting (12%) were the most prevalent eating practices and were more common in boys dissatisfied with weight or shape. There was no difference in prevalence of eating practices between boys wishing to gain and boys wishing to lose weight. Although many boys were concerned about body weight and shape, they wished to increase weight and muscularity, rather than lose weight. Binge eating was common, but was not related to the binge-purge cycle described in girls, because losing weight is not a major concern, and other weight control practices were not more common among boys who wanted to lose weight vs gain.\r"

Before the OPV1 challenge, the previously epIPV-immunized recipients had a geometric mean poliovirus type 1 microneutralization antibody titer (geometric mean titer [GMT]) of 11.1 IU, which was significantly higher than the prechallenge GMT of 2.2 IU among the children who had previously received OPV. Three weeks after the OPV1 challenge, the GMTs for the epIPV-immunized recipients and the OPV-immunized recipients were 35.3 IU and 5.1 IU, respectively. For the epIPV-immunized recipients, both the prechallenge GMT and the postchallenge GMT were dependent on the D antigen content of the vaccine that they had previously received. A fourfold or greater rise in poliovirus type 1 antibody occurred after the OPV1 challenge in 50.9% of the epIPV-immunized children and in 28.6% of the OPV-immunized children; this difference was statistically significant. For both groups, antibody boosts were inversely correlated with the pre-challenge serum antibody titer. However, the epIPV-immunized children consistently were more likely to boost than the OPV-immunized children at equivalent levels of prechallenge antibody. This experience indicated that OPV1 administration effectively raises the level of serum antibody in children previously immunized with three doses of epIPV, especially in children with lower levels of preexisting antibody. This booster response was superior to the booster response of children who received three doses of OPV.\r"

For 8 offspring, the mothers learned of their partners' serostatus and received counseling against pregnancy prior to the fifth month of gestation; for 9 offspring (37.5%), the mothers learned of their own seropositivity and received counseling prior to the fifth month. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome developed in 7 (35%) of 20 fathers, 4 of whom died; HIV-related symptoms developed in 4; severe liver disease developed in 2; and 7 (35%) were in good health. In four mothers (20%) HIV-related symptoms developed. Five offspring were breast-fed for 2 days to more than 3 years, two while the mother was known to be seropositive; four of these were seronegative and healthy, and one was seropositive at 30 months of age and had persistent cervical lymphadenopathy at 48 months of age. Infants were born at term; median birth weight was 2.86 kg. Solely on the basis of serologic studies and symptoms for those with more than 15 months of follow-up, the minimum perinatal transmission rate for this group of women without putative transmission cofactors (drug usage, promiscuity, malnutrition, HIV symptoms) was at least 25%, a rate comparable to that reported for women in other risk groups.\r"

Fluoroscopically directed stiff-wire manipulation of malpositioned PD catheters has been advocated as a method of catheter salvage. Two hundred eighty-nine single-cuff PD catheters were placed surgically into 203 patients during this 4-year study. Thirty-three patients developed catheter malfunction attributed to malposition. Forty-eight stiff-wire manipulations were performed on these patients. Thirty-eight (78%) of the manipulations were described as successful at the time of transfer from radiology. However, only 25 (51%) and 12 (25%) resulted in functioning catheters at 1 week and 1 month, respectively. Only 11 of 33 patients who underwent manipulation had functional prolongation of catheter life beyond 1 month. The PD catheter was replaced by a column-disk PD catheter without additional catheter dysfunction in six patients. A second single-cuff Tenckhoff PD catheter was inserted in another six patients. Three of these six catheters again malpositioned. We conclude that stiff-wire manipulation is a useful and safe technique worth using on a limited basis for the initial episode of catheter malposition. Catheters that repetitively malposition should be replaced with a catheter that is resistant to malpositioning.\r"

  ".W": "It is advantageous to make an independent assessment of the potassium (K) secretory process and the luminal flow rate in the renal cortex to evaluate K handling by the kidney during hypokalemia or hyperkalemia. The transtubular potassium concentration gradient (TTKG) is a semiquantitative index of the activity of the K secretory process. The purpose of this study was to define expected values for the TTKG in normal subjects with hypokalemia or following an acute K load. During hypokalemia of non-renal origin, the TTKG was 0.9 +/- 0.2; in contrast, the TTKG was significantly higher during the hypokalemia of hyperaldosteronism, 6.7 +/- 1.3. The TTKG was 11.8 +/- 3.6, 2 hours after normokalemic subjects received 0.2 mg 9 alpha-fludrocortisone (9 alpha-F). To obtain expected values during hyperkalemia, normal subjects ingested 50 mmol potassium chloride; 2 hours later, the TTKG was 13.1 +/- 3.8. Therefore, the expected value for the TTKG must be interpreted relative to the concentration of K in the plasma. Circumstances were also defined where the TTKG is low despite hyperaldosteronism, namely, during a water diuresis and pre-existing hypokalemia.\r"

To explore this possibility, we studied rats that had been pretreated with indomethacin or normal saline and subsequently bilaterally nephrectomized and potassium loaded. There were no significant differences between the indomethacin and control groups in the baseline, final, or increment in plasma potassium concentration after a potassium load. Similar results were obtained whether potassium was given intraperitoneally (IP) or intravenously (IV). Serum indomethacin levels confirmed that indomethacin was well absorbed transperitoneally. We conclude that in nephrectomized but otherwise healthy rats, high-dose indomethacin does not impair the cellular uptake of an acute potassium load.\r"

We found that serum fluoride was completely ultrafiltrable across cuprophane membranes (99% +/- 4%) and that HD produced acute changes in plasma fluoride levels that correlated well with the fluoride gradient between plasma and dialysis fluid at the start of dialysis. Our HD fluids contained significantly higher fluoride concentrations than were present in commercially prepared peritoneal dialysis fluid. Our fluids are prepared from fluoridated tap water that is purified by reverse osmosis (RO). We conclude that the different concentrations of fluoride in our dialysis fluids account for the differences in the plasma flouride concentrations between our dialysis groups. Since many HD units rely on RO systems to purify fluoridated tap water, it is likely that many HD patients are being exposed inadvertently to increased concentrations of fluoride.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to quantitate the improvement in exercise capacity produced in anemic chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients after correction of their anemia with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). The maximal exercise capacity and quadriceps strength of 19 anemic HD patients was tested before and after correction of the anemia with rHuEPO. A progressive work exercise protocol (PWET) on a cycle ergometer was used to compare measurements of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), maximal heart rate, and subjective assessment of fatigue during the test. Measurements of quadriceps strength were performed before the cycle ergometer studies. At baseline, all patients had reduced VO2max (15.3 +/- 5.4 mL/kg/min) and maximal exercise heart rates (138.5 +/- 23.9 beats/min). rHuEPO increased the mean hematocrit from 21.2% to 35%, and this was associated with a 17% increase (P less than 0.0005) in the VO2max. At any specified work load, rHuEPO treatment decreased heart rate, minute ventilation, and the subjective perception of fatigue. Both isometric and isokinetic measurements of quadriceps strength were improved following administration of rHuEPO. The maximal exercise heart rate was decreased in comparison to the baseline measurements (P less than 0.04), suggesting that in contrast to normal subjects, HD patients stop exercise before oxygen transport limitations are reached. In this unselected group of chronic HD patients, rHuEPO produced clinically significant improvements in both aerobic exercise capacity and isometric and isokinetic quadriceps strength. The improvement in aerobic capacity was substantially less than would have been expected from the correction of a comparable degree of anemia in non-HD patients. None of the 19 treated patients attained the exercise performance level predicted for a sedentary normal subject.\r"

The study cases were classified into four groups, according to the cause of death and the degree of atherosclerosis. Cases in Group 1, in which death resulted from complications of severe atherosclerosis, have a mean serum cholesterol of 186.7 +/- 41.8 mg/dL, and the cholesterol is less than 200 in 65% and less than 250 in 92% of cases. Cases in Group 2, with severe atherosclerosis dying of other diseases, have a mean serum cholesterol of 174.6 +/- 60.4 mg/dL, and the cholesterol is less than 200 in 79% of cases and less than 250 in 89% of cases. Cases in Groups 3 and 4, with moderate and minimal atherosclerosis, respectively, have mean serum cholesterol values of 172.3 +/- 54.8 and 143.5 +/- 47.8 mg/dL, and the cholesterol is less than 200 in 71% and 92% and less than 250 in 92% and 96% of cases, respectively. Serum cholesterol is significantly associated with severity of atherosclerosis in the total sample (P = 0.01). Three fourths of all cases (147/194) have neither diabetes nor hypertension, and in 74% of these cases (109/147) the cholesterol is less than 200 and in 92% (135/147) the cholesterol is less than 250. In 66% (80/122) of the cases with severe atherosclerosis, the disease developed without evidence of elevated serum cholesterol, diabetes, or hypertension. Blood homocysteine, which has been shown by other studies to be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, is recommended for assessing prognosis in these cases.\r"

  ".W": "The authors determined the incidence of ibuprofen-associated renal impairment and risk factors for its development in 1908 patients treated with ibuprofen using data from a computerized medical records system. Renal impairment occurred in 343 patients (18%). Multivariable analysis revealed six independent predictors of renal impairment: age, prior renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, male gender, elevated systolic blood pressure, and diuretic use. They then tested the degree to which ibuprofen contributed to the development of renal impairment by evaluating a control group of 3933 acetaminophen recipients. Neither ibuprofen nor acetaminophen was among the independent predictors of risk when all patients were considered (adjusted odds ratio, 1.05; 95% Cl, 0.88-1.26). However, two subsets of at risk patients had an ibuprofen effect: patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age who received ibuprofen were at greater risk of renal impairment as compared to acetaminophen recipients (adjusted odds ratio, 1.34; 95% Cl, 1.05 to 1.72) as were patients with coronary artery disease (adjusted odds ratio, 2.54; 95% Cl, 1.38 to 4.68). Their results suggest that elderly patients and patients with coronary artery disease are at risk for ibuprofen-associated renal impairment and therefore should have their renal function monitored when ibuprofen and possibly other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are prescribed.\r"

The LTs were detected in the CSF of more of these patients (70%) than any of the other eicosanoids, and usually in the highest concentration. Among the 11 posthemorrhagic patients CSF eicosanoid levels were highest when determined soon after injury. Moreover, the variety of eicosanoids present, as well as concentrations, in these infants decreased with time. The types of eicosanoids most evident in the CSF of patients who required shunting were TxB2 and LTs, being present together in 5 of 6 (83%) of these infants. In contrast, 1 of 5 (20%) of the patients who did not require this neurosurgical intervention contained both TxB2 and LTs, the remaining having only one or neither eicosanoid. The highest average concentration for each eicosanoid studied was (pg/ml): PGE2, 628; PGF2 alpha, 985; PGD2, 1410; 6-keto PGF1 alpha, 544; TxB2, 486 and LTs, 1229. This study is the first to demonstrate that the CSF of preterm infants may contain a wide variety of eicosanoids and indicates that these lipids are a manifestation of neurological assault.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with anasarca, the relative importance of cardiac, pulmonary and/or hepatic dysfunction is often difficult to determine. Conventional use of the Swan-Ganz catheter helps to separate the contributions of right and left heart disease, but it is seldom used to evaluate liver dysfunction. This report describes passage of a Swan-Ganz catheter into the hepatic vein prior to pulmonary artery placement in 11 patients. Hepatic vein catheterization permitted wedged hepatic venography using contrast media and measurement of the wedged and free hepatic venous pressures. All 11 patients had pulmonary hypertension; three had cor pulmonale only, and the others had combinations of left and right heart failure. In addition, six patients had either a cirrhotic pattern on venography, or portal hypertension. Only three of these six patients had previous clinical evidence of liver disease. This study does not prove that identification of hepatic dysfunction by this method improves the outcome in such patients. However, this low risk modification of standard pulmonary artery catheterization provides additional information which is clinically useful in searching for and avoiding complications of cirrhosis, as well as offering a clearer understanding of pathophysiology in acute multisystem disease.\r"
