Clinical studies have demonstrated anistreplase to be equally efficacious as intracoronary streptokinase when given within four hours of the onset of chest pain. Thirty units, given as a single bolus intravenous injection, result in reperfusion rates of approximately 60-70 percent. The adverse-effect profile of anistreplase compares favorably with that of streptokinase, with hemorrhagic complications being the most serious. Anistreplase has two distinct advantages over both streptokinase and alteplase: (1) it can be administered as a single bolus intravenous injection and (2) it has a longer half-life which may result in decreased reocclusion rates. Anistreplase therapy is associated with reductions in both short- and long-term mortality and has been shown to preserve left ventricular function. A large, long-term, comparative clinical trial (Third International Study of Infarct Survival or ISIS-III) investigating morbidity and mortality rates with streptokinase, alteplase, and anistreplase is ongoing, as is a direct comparative study against alteplase alone (TEAM-3, Multicenter Thrombolytic Trials of Eminase in Acute Myocardial Infarction).\r"

  ".U": "90296613\r", 
  ".W": "Flutamide is a nonsteroidal pure antiandrogen that acts by inhibiting the uptake and/or binding of dihydrotestosterone to the target cell receptor, thus interfering with androgen action. Flutamide is well absorbed orally and extensively metabolized; its active metabolite, 2-hydroxyflutamide, is formed rapidly and excreted almost entirely by the kidneys. Clinical studies in prostate cancer patients have demonstrated efficacy with flutamide monotherapy in patients who had received no prior treatment, in untreated patients with combined androgen blockade concomitantly with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)-agonist, and in relapsed patients. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated a 26 percent increase in median survival for patients treated with leuprolide plus flutamide compared with leuprolide plus placebo. When given as monotherapy and in combination with an LHRH-agonist, flutamide is well tolerated. The usual adverse effects are gynecomastia and mild diarrhea when given as a single agent. In combination with an LHRH-agonist, hot flashes, loss of libido, impotence, mild nausea and vomiting, gynecomastia, and diarrhea are commonly reported. However, only diarrhea occurred more frequently in patients treated with leuprolide plus flutamide than in those treated with leuprolide plus placebo. Flutamide is indicated in combination with an LHRH-agonist (e.g., leuprolide) as initial therapy in metastatic (stage D2) prostate cancer. The usual dose is 250 mg po tid given at eight-hour intervals and started concurrently with the LHRH-agonist. Formulary addition is recommended.\r"

  ".W": "A long-term follow-up study was performed to evaluate the long-term value of performing multiple dilatations according to their procedural (single-vessel multilesion or mutltivessel dilatations) and anatomic types (single-vessel disease with multiple dilatations or multivessel disease dilatations with complete and incomplete revascularization). From 1980 until 1988, 248 patients met the following criteria: (1) at least two lesions dilated (range: 2 to 4) and (2) all attempted lesions successfully dilated. The mean length of follow-up was 33 months. The end points analyzed were death, myocardial infarction, redilatation, and bypass surgery. No differences were found for these events between the single-vessel multilesion group (144 patients) and the multivessel group (104 patients). The 4.5-year probability of event-free survival was 68% and 70%, respectively, for the multilesion group and the multivessel group. In the event-free patients, 57% versus 59% were asymptomatic and 45% versus 46% were not taking antianginal drugs. In the anatomic subgroups, there were less event-free patients in the cohort of incompletely revascularized multivessel disease patients (55% of 55 patients) when compared with the cohort of those who were completely revascularized (84% of 79 patients) or when compared with the single-vessel disease multiple dilatation patients (74% of 107 patients). The 4.5-year event-free survival probability for each group was 44%, 78%, and 74%, respectively. This difference was caused by more infarctions (9% versus 2% versus 4%, respectively) and bypass operations in the multivessel disease, incomplete revascularization group (20% versus 5% versus 10%, respectively). In event-free patients, improvement of angina was similar and was documented in over 85% of patients in each group. Furthermore, the number of asymptomatic patients at follow-up was similar in all groups except that within the incomplete revascularization group, less patients were free of antianginal drugs (21% versus 51% versus 48%). Finally, 48% of the entire cohort performed an exercise test 4.6 months (mean) after dilatation and no difference was found in any of the variables in any group. About 10% of the patients experienced angina and approximately 30% had a positive exercise test for ischemia by ST segment criteria. The functional performance in every group was over 90% of the predicted work load. These results suggest that completeness of revascularization in multivessel disease patients is an important prognostic variable. However, the symptomatic improvement after dilatation is very rewarding in all subsets of patients and argues in favor of the continued use of multiple dilatations as a treatment strategy.\r"

The protocol comprised a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 5-month prospective study carried out in an outpatient general internal medicine clinic in a university medical center. There were 92 patients ages 18 to 70, with mild primary hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure of greater than 90 mm Hg and less than 105 mm Hg) without significant cardiac, renal, cerebrovascular, hepatic, neoplastic, or hematologic disorders. Patients with severe hyperlipidemia or peripheral vascular disease were also excluded. All factors known to effect serum lipids were held constant throughout the study (i.e., diet, weight, exercise, caffeine, tobacco). Atenolol and clonidine significantly reduced blood pressure when compared with placebo. Atenolol caused significant increases in serum triglycerides and apolipoprotein B (p less than 0.05) and significant reductions in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, apolipoproteins A-I and A-II (p less than 0.05). Atenolol also induced a significant adverse effect on all lipid ratios, increasing total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol/high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-II ratios and decreasing low density lipoprotein-cholesterol/apolipoprotein-B ratio (p less than 0.05). Clonidine caused significant reductions in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, apolipoproteins AI and AII (p less than 0.05 but was neutral on all other lipids, lipid subfractions, and apolipoproteins. Clonidine did not significantly alter any of the lipid ratios.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Calcium channel blockers, adenosine compounds, amjaline, and the newer drugs flecainide and propafenone offer an efficacy rate of more than 80% for acute termination of PJRT. Choice should be based on the patient's clinical characteristics including any underlying cardiac or noncardiac pathologic conditions, hemodynamic status, and current medications. Drugs with a very short half-life (adenosine compounds) offer the possibility of repeated administration at increasing dosages or of subsequent administration of a second antiarrhythmic drug without fear of increased adverse effects or drug interactions. Drugs with a long half-life, such as calcium channel blockers, flecainide, and propafenone, have the potential advantage of preventing an immediate recurrence of the arrhythmia. Adenosine compounds are the fastest acting drugs, resulting in termination of PJRT in less than 30 seconds. The cardiac side effects of all antiarrhythmic drugs represent an exaggeration of their intrinsic electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects. Thus hemodynamic decompensation and bradyarrhythmias resulting from sinus nodal, AV nodal, or infranodal dysfunction are of major concern. Side effects of adenosine compounds are extremely common but very short lasting. Verapamil is both highly effective and safe except in very special circumstances. Guidelines for therapy of PJRT in specific groups of patients are provided.\r"

The possible triggers reported by 849 patients enrolled in the Multicenter Investigation of Limitation of Infarct Size were analyzed. Possible triggers were identified by 48.5% of the population; the most common were emotional upset (18.4%) and moderate physical activity (14.1%). Multiple possible triggers were reported by 13% of the population. Younger patients, men and those without diabetes mellitus were more likely to report a possible trigger than were older patients, women and those with diabetes. The likelihood of reporting a trigger was not affected by infarct size. This study suggests that potentially identifiable triggers may play an important role in AMI. Because potential triggering activities are common in persons with coronary artery disease, yet infrequently result in AMI, further studies are needed to identify (1) the circumstances in which a potential trigger may cause an event, (2) the specific nature of potential triggering activites, (3) the frequency of such activities in individuals who do not develop AMI and (4) the presence or absence of identifiable triggers in various subgroups of patients with infarction.\r"

Eighteen of 22 patients reported symptom benefit while taking lidoflazine 360 mg daily. Compared to baseline exercise treadmill testing, lidoflazine resulted in significant improvement in exercise duration (812 +/- 337 vs 628 +/- 357 seconds, p less than 0.01) and time to onset of chest pain (530 +/- 343 vs 348 +/- 246 seconds, p less than 0.01). The 5 patients with ischemic ST-segment changes during baseline testing demonstrated an almost 4-minute delay in ST-segment depression (3 patients) or no ST-segment depression (2 patients) while taking lidoflazine. Repeat invasive study of coronary flow in 11 patients taking lidoflazine demonstrated significantly greater coronary vasodilation at rest, during pacing, during pacing after ergonovine and after dipyridamole administration (all p less than 0.03), compared to the initial drug-free study. During the randomized, placebo-controlled phase of the study with 7-week treatment periods, 9 of 11 patients who completed this phase of the study preferred lidoflazine and all demonstrated improved exercise capacity with lidoflazine compared to placebo. However, 3 patients developed malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and 1 died while taking lidoflazine, resulting in termination of the study. Limited coronary vasodilator response in microvascular angina has a reversible vasoconstrictor component and may be due to elevated systolic calcium levels. Despite the hemodynamic, symptom and exercise benefit, lidoflazine may be unsafe for clinical use because of its propensity to cause potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

Recent studies have implicated psychosocial factors, including depression, the interaction of social isolation and life stress, and type A-B behavior pattern, as predictors of cardiac events, controlling for known parameters of disease severity. However, results tend not to be consistent and are sometimes contradictory. The present investigation was designed to test the predictive association between biobehavioral factors and clinical cardiac events. This evaluation occurred in the context of a prospective clinical trial, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS). Five-hundred two patients were recruited with greater than or equal to 10 ventricular premature complexes/hour or greater than or equal to 5 episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, recorded 6 to 60 days after a myocardial infarction. Baseline behavioral studies, conducted in approximately 66% of patients, included psychosocial questionnaires of anxiety, depression, social desirability and support, and type A-B behavior pattern. In addition, blood pressure and pulse rate reactivity to a portable videogame was assessed. The primary outcome was scored on the basis of mortality or cardiac arrest. Results indicated that the type B behavior pattern, higher levels of depression and lower pulse rate reactivity to challenge were significant risk factors for death or cardiac arrest, after adjusting statistically for a set of known clinical predictors of disease severity. The implication of these results for future research relating behavioral factors to cardiac endpoints is discussed.\r"

In this study, the relation of these biobehaviorial factors to frequency of ventricular premature complexes, a predictor of sudden death was investigated. The study population was made up of patients enrolled in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS). Ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) were assessed by multiple, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings. Patients completed trait psychosocial measures assessed at baseline and state psychosocial measures assessed periodically during a 1-year follow-up period. Psychosocial measures included self-reports of depression, anxiety, anger and type A behavior pattern. A competitive challenge using a video game was used as a stressor to elicit cardiovascular reactivity and was administered at baseline and during follow-up sessions. Cardiovascular reactivity was defined as peak level during stressor exposure minus the mean of resting levels for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate. Results indicated that biobehavioral factors were not associated with diurnal VPC rates. Furthermore, biobehavioral factors did not predict response to antiarrhythmic therapy. Based upon the results of this study, it is speculated that the established relation between behavioral factors and sudden death may not be mediated by VPC rates.\r"

A 24-hour intravenous phase measured and compared invasive hemodynamics, followed by oral administration for assessment of arrhythmia suppression. Thirty-two patients (mean age 61 years) with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) were evaluated, 15 while receiving indecainide and 17 while receiving procainamide. A total of 8 patients had serious toxicity during the intravenous phase; 6 receiving indecainide experienced increased left ventricular dysfunction or worsening arrhythmia (sustained VT, arrhythmic death) while 2 receiving procainamide developed serious hypotension. Proarrhythmia developed in 3 of 15 (20%) of the indecainide patients, but in no procainamide patient. In those tolerating indecainide, long-term suppression of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) and of runs of VT was more consistent than with procainamide. While indecainide was a potent suppressor of spontaneous VPCs and VT, patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction could not tolerate it. The indecainide patients developing serious toxicity had a common hemodynamic profile: ejection fraction less than 25%, elevated left ventricular filling pressures, low cardiac and stroke volume index and minimal cardiac reserve. Indecainide has a poor risk-benefit ratio in patients similar to the current population, who have potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias and severe left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Consumption of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) is associated with a reduced incidence of coronary arterial diseases. Dietary n-3 PUFAs act via several mechanisms. They depress plasma lipids, especially triglycerides (TGs), by inhibiting hepatic TGs and possibly apoprotein synthesis. They replace arachidonic acid (AA) in phospholipid pools with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA). EPA and DHA, when released, inhibit cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase and reduce eicosanoid synthesis, particularly thromboxane (TXA2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4), by platelets and macrophages. Reduction of the proaggregatory, vasoconstrictive TXA2 decreases the thrombotic tendency of platelets. This is augmented by the limited depression of the vasoactive antiaggregatory prostacyclin (PGI2) and the generation of antiaggregatory prostaglandin I3 (PGI3) from EPA. The n-3 PUFAs also depress eicosanoid metabolism in platelets, monocytes, and macrophages, and thereby may retard the initiation and progress of atherogenesis. n-3 PUFAs reduce blood pressure and blood viscosity and modulate membrane fluidity and associated enzyme and receptor functions. The collective effects of n-3 PUFAs may account for the reduction in coronary arterial disease in populations consuming foods containing n-3 PUFAs.\r"

Significant dose-related increases of the n-3 fatty acids 20:5, 22:5, and 22:6 in plasma phospholipids (p less than 0.0001) were found, corresponding roughly to decreases of the n-6 fatty acids 18:2 and 20:4 (p less than 0.001). Serum triglycerides and HDL3-cholesterol concentrations showed a dose-dependent reduction (p less than 0.05) and HDL2 cholesterol increased (p less than 0.05). Results for 3 and 6 g n-3 fatty acids were similar. No dose-dependent effects were observed in the VLDL-, LDL-, and total HDL-cholesterol subfractions; blood pressure; bleeding time; erythrocyte deformability; or capacity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to kill Staphylococcus aureus. This study indicates that 3 g n-3 ethyl ester fatty acids appears to be the appropriate supplementation dose in humans, at least regarding lipid-profile changes and the ability to incorporate such fatty acids in the plasma phospholipids.\r"

Calibration curves were used to assign an energy value to daytime HR above FLEX HR. Below FLEX HR energy expenditure was taken as resting metabolism. Sleeping energy expenditure was assumed to be equal to basal metabolic rate. Average HR TEE (12.99 +/- 3.83 MJ/d) and average DLW TEE (12.89 +/- 3.80 MJ/d) were similar. HR TEE discrepancies ranged from -22.2% to +52.1%, with nine values lying within +/- 10% of DLW TEE estimates. The FLEX HR method provides a close estimation of the TEE of population groups. However, an increased number of sampling days may improve the precision of individual estimates of TEE.\r"

Their responses to feeding were compared with those to a short period of fasting (15-24 h). The 9-h thermic response to the repeated feeding of HP meals was found to be greater than that to the HC meals (9.6 +/- 0.6% vs 5.7 +/- 0.4% of the energy intake, respectively, means +/- SEM, p less than 0.01). The rate of whole-body nitrogen turnover over 9 h increased from 17.6 +/- 2.2 g on the fasting day to 27.4 +/- 1.4 g during HC feeding (NS) and there was a further increase to 58.2 +/- 5.3 g resulting from HP feeding (p less than 0.001). By using theoretical estimates (based upon ATP requirements) of the metabolic cost of protein synthesis, 36 +/- 9% of the thermic response to HC feeding and 68 +/- 3% of the response to HP feeding could be accounted for by the increases in protein synthesis compared with the fasting state.\r"

  ".W": "The distinction between malignant mixed mullerian tumor (MMMT) of the female genital tract and poorly differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma (EA) is sometimes difficult and arbitrary. Although several studies have described the immunohistochemical profile of MMMT and EA, the results have varied, and controversy regarding the histogenetic relationship between them remains. The authors examined the histologic characteristics and immunohistochemistry of 31 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded MMMTs from a variety of female genital tract sites with a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method. Eighteen neoplasms were homologous and 13 were heterologous; the average patient age was 67 years. In all cases the epithelial component stained for keratin (K), whereas the stromal component stained in 48%; vimentin (V) was detected in the epithelial component in 35% and the stromal component in 81%. Myoglobin (M) detected rhabdomyoblasts in three of five cases tested; desmin (D) was found in five of six and actin (A) in all six cases with skeletal muscle. Overall, A stained the stromal components in 45% of cases, whereas none of the epithelial components stained. The coexpression of K and V in the epithelial component of 35% of cases and in the stromal component of 48% of cases led the authors to conclude that the immunoprofile of MMMT broadly overlaps with that of EA and, independent of morphologic findings, it is often not reliable or useful in distinguishing between the two. Furthermore, the variable immunoprofile suggests that MMMT may be a histogenetically heterogeneous group of neoplasms, including both carcinomas (metaplastic, sarcomatoid) as well as true carcinosarcomas. Although A detected rhabdomyoblasts in all cases, it also stained neoplastic mesenchymal elements in eight more cases, suggesting the presence of smooth muscle or myofibroblasts in the stroma of some MMMTs.\r"

The thrombocytopenia currently is controlled by intermittent vincristine, having proved refractory to steroids, splenectomy, and danazol and only partially responsive to high dose intravenous immunoglobulin. The neutropenia showed temporary improvement with immunoglobulin but has been resistant to all other therapy. This case provides further evidence for disordered immune regulation in Castleman's disease.\r"

During survey of the infection route, it was learned that the patient's pet rabbit and three other rabbits of the same family line had cervicofacial lumps. The pet rabbit had high levels of toxoplasmic antibodies. Immunofluorescence tests on the infraorbital lump also revealed Toxoplasma gondii. Therefore, it was concluded that in this case the rabbit had transmitted Toxoplasma to the patient. The authors know of no other reports of toxoplasmosis transmitted by or through rabbit to human.\r"

Paraffin sections from 41 MEMs and 43 ACSs (pulmonary, \"serous surface papillary,\" and metastatic mammary adenocarcinomas) were evaluated for their expression of Leu-M1, LN1, LN2, and the Mac 387 antigen. Diagnoses were based in each case on the results of conventional histologic and electron microscopic examinations. Leu-M1 was detected only in minute foci of three peritoneal MEMs and was absent entirely in pleural mesotheliomas. Conversely, 38 of 43 ACSs expressed this marker. Three cases of peritoneal MEM and one pleural mesothelioma were multifocally LN2 positive, as were 39 of 43 ACSs. LN1 was the most frequently expressed antigen in MEM, being observed in 18 such tumors (10 pleural; 8 peritoneal); it was also detected in 37 of 43 ACSs. Mac 387 failed to label any of the neoplasms assessed in this series. These results demonstrate similar patterns of \"myelomonocytic\" antigen expression by diverse ACS and a general absence of Leu-M1 and LN2 in MEM. LN1 and the Mac 387 antigen appear to have no additional value when compared with Leu-M1 and LN2 in the immunohistochemical evaluation of serosal neoplasms.\r"

Sixty-four such cases were divided into three histologic groups on the basis of routine and immunohistochemical stains: (1) Tubular carcinoids were small and confined to the appendix, had small amounts of intraluminal mucin with few or no goblet cells, were nonargentaffin, lacked serotonin, and were diffusely positive for glucagon. All ten with follow-up (mean, 17 months) were without metastasis. (2) Goblet cell carcinoids were confined to the appendix and mesoappendix, circumferentially surrounded the appendiceal lumen, and were often not suspected grossly. Histologically, they were often mixed with small crypt-like glands and were serotonin positive. All 22 with follow-up (mean, 19 months) were without metastasis whether or not right hemicolectomy was performed. (3) Mixed carcinoid-adenocarcinomas showed spread into the cecum or adjacent viscera at the time of diagnosis and had a large carcinomatous pattern with areas of mucinous, signet-ring, or single-file structure, in addition to goblet cell or insular carcinoid. All patients had right hemicolectomies, and all but two with follow-up died of the disease (mean, 16 months). Although a histologic spectrum exists among carcinoid tumors and certain adenocarcinomas of the appendix, it is possible to delineate three biologically distinct groups. Surgical margins should be taken of all appendices because these tumors often do not form discrete masses.\r"

In formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of ten type A, ten type B, and eight non-MG cases, the thymic epithelium and other cellular components were stained in conjunction with the basement membrane by a double immunoenzymatic method. This technique demonstrated a moderate architectural disturbance in type A thymus, with distended perivascular space (PVS), elongated medullary epithelium, and disrupted basement membrane. These changes were more prominent in type B thymus but were minimal to lacking in non-MG thymus. Compared with those in non-MG thymus, the myoid cells in MG thymuses of both types tended to cluster around the Hassall's corpuscles, with a slight decrease in number in type B but not in type A. B-lymphocytes were present in type B, type A, and non-MG thymuses in that order of abundance; the cells were confined to the medullary parenchyma in the non-MG group but were numerous both in the PVS and medulla in the MG groups. T-lymphocytes were increased in the expanded PVS of type A and B MG thymuses. The number of interdigitating reticulum cells was similar in the three groups, but the cellular distribution was more dispersed in MG thymuses of both types. These findings, although previously described in type B thymus, have not been well recognized in type A thymus. They support the view that a common abnormality (presumably chronic thymitis), differing in degree only, underlies MG thymuses regardless of the presence of follicular hyperplasia.\r"

Ringed sideroblasts may still be demonstrable by silver stain in cases of sideroblastic anemia without ringed sideroblasts, for which severe iron deficiency prevents detection of the abnormal sideroblasts by Perls' reaction. As iron has been reported to be present in mitochondria of ringed sideroblasts in the form of ferric phosphate, it is possible that the silver stain demonstrates the phosphate moiety and not the iron, thus explaining its greater sensitivity in iron deficiency as compared to Perls' reaction. Further study is necessary to confirm the staining mechanism, to elucidate the composition of iron deposits, and to explain the pathophysiology of sideroblastic anemia.\r"

Breast cancer cells from patient effusion fluids or from established cell lines were mixed with normal human bone marrow at dilutions ranging from 1:10 to 1:100,000. Cells were labeled with five directly fluoresceinated murine monoclonal antibodies reactive against epithelial cell surface determinants of 42, 55, 72, 200, and more than 200 kD. Fluorescence of tumor cells within the mixtures was then analyzed with the use of a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. In multiple experiments, one tumor cell in 10,000 nucleated marrow cells could be detected by flow cytometry. In addition, a linear correlation was observed over approximately 3 logs between the number of tumor cells added and the number of tumor cells detected. In a double-blind study comparing flow cytometry and cytology, flow cytometric analysis detected one tumor cell among 10,000 marrow precursors in 14 of 15 instances, whereas standard cytologic methods detected similar tumor contamination in 9 of 15 instances. Neither technique used individually could detect one tumor cell in 100,000 bone marrow cells. Used in combination, however, flow cytometry and cytology could detect one breast cancer cell among 100,000 normal marrow progenitors.\r"

All of the 396 units cultured were negative except one red cell unit that grew a Bacillus species, probably B. subtilis. Further studies suggested that the growth of B. subtilis was due to laboratory contamination. The authors concluded that more work is needed to study the bacterial growth and the effect on red cell enzymes in the units of blood that are exposed to room temperature for varying periods or are returned to the blood bank after 30 minutes of issuance. If no adverse effect is noted, the policy of not reissuing such units may need revision so that more units could be salvaged.\r"

During her relatively frequent episodes of acute rejection, she was treated with methylprednisolone and repeated application of ATG. A short time before the patient's death, a fine-needle aspiration of the liver revealed the cytologic diagnosis of a malignant pleomorphic medium-size cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of a higher grade of malignancy. Immunosuppression was reduced, and the patient died in cardiogenic shock related to a histologically confirmed episode of severe acute rejection 264 days after the transplantation. On autopsy, the malignant lymphoma previously diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration cytology was found to be present in the liver as the only extranodal localization. The immunohistologic analysis of the immunophenotype specified the lymphomatous neoplasia as a T-cell lymphoma. The particular importance of this case is that it is, to our knowledge, the third case of proven T-cell lymphoma following organ grafting documented in the literature and the first case described in a cardiac allograft recipient.\r"

Of these procedures 527 (30.6%) were early amniocenteses. Medical records were reviewed for maternal age, amniocentesis indication, color of amniotic fluid, gestational age, frequency of needle insertion, complications of amniocentesis and delivery, results of prenatal testing, and pregnancy outcome. Complete follow-up data were available for 517 (98.1%). There were 10 miscarriages before 28 weeks' gestation (1.9%), one loss after 28 weeks (0.2%), and one stillbirth (0.2%), resulting in a total postprocedural loss rate of 2.3%. Miscarriage within 2 weeks of amniocentesis occurred in four subjects (0.8%).\r"

  ".U": "90297113\r", 
  ".W": "Fetal distress is a widely used but poorly defined term. This confusion of definition compounds the difficulty of making an accurate diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment. The fetus reacts at the onset of asphyxia with a remarkable series of responses, primarily a complexly regulated redistribution of blood flow that serves to limit the deleterious effects of oxygen limitation in vital organs. This enables the fetus to survive asphyxia intact unless the insult is profound or prolonged. The most common asphyxial stresses imposed on the fetus during labor are insufficiency of uterine blood flow, or insufficiency of umbilical blood flow, and occasionally decrease in uterine arterial oxygenation. Each of these stresses produces characteristic fetal heart rate patterns: late decelerations, variable decelerations, or prolonged bradycardia. There is strong evidence that the presence of normal fetal heart rate variability represents normal central nervous system integrity, including adequate oxygenation. A decrease or loss of variability in the presence of these patterns is a sign that the physiologic compensations are overwhelmed as a result of the severity of asphyxia. Knowledge of the fetal responses to asphyxia, together with the known evolution of fetal heart rate patterns during asphyxia, should allow a more accurate definition of the onset of unacceptable asphyxia, and more rational management and timing of intervention.\r"

A series of 350 consecutive singleton pregnancies were included in the study. A continuous-wave Doppler instrument with a 4 MHz transducer was used. The criteria for an abnormal perinatal outcome included intrauterine growth retardation, an Apgar score of less than 7 at 5 minutes, umbilical arterial pH at birth less than 7.20, presence of thick meconium, fetal distress in labor, and neonatal complications necessitating admission to the neonatal intensive care nursery. The analytic techniques included determination of the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the kappa index. The results demonstrated that although the cutoff value of 2.9 showed the maximum inherent discriminatory power, its diagnostic efficacy (sensitivity, 0.83; specificity, 0.87 positive predictive value, 0.74; negative predictive value, 0.92; and kappa index, 0.68) was not substantially different from that of the more common cutoff value of 3.0 (sensitivity, 0.79; specificity, 0.93; positive predictive value, 0.83; negative predictive value, 0.91; and kappa index, 0.73). Both values were rated good to excellent by the kappa index. The study also demonstrated that the systolic/diastolic ratio was a better predictor of general abnormal outcome than of the suboptimal fetal growth.\r"

Only a frank breech and an anteriorly located fetal spine were associated with a successful version. Four episodes of fetal bradycardia occurred, none requiring operative intervention. There were no episodes of maternal bleeding or dislodgement of the placenta. Fifty-eight percent of all breech presentations were converted and 62% were delivered vaginally. We conclude that ultrasonography is useful in the evaluation of patients with a nonvertex presentation at term and can be used to predict which patients are likely to undergo a successful external cephalic version.\r"

Equipotent doses of esmolol and propranolol were determined by both heart rate effects and by isoproterenol response curves. Propranolol (2 mg/kg) was administered intravenously as a bolus dose and esmolol (0.4-0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1) was administered by continuous infusion. Both esmolol and propranolol significantly decreased heart rate and mean arterial pressure (P less than 0.001). Baseline pulmonary resistance and dynamic compliance did not change after the administration of either propranolol or esmolol. However, propranolol significantly shifted the methacholine dose-response curve to the left so that methacholine (0.3 mg/ml) increased pulmonary resistance by 7.9 +/- 0.97 cmH2O.l-1.s-1 (mean +/- SEM of seven dogs) after pretreatment with propranolol but only 4.4 +/- 0.89 cmH2O.l-1.s-1 (P less than 0.05) without propranolol pretreatment (control). Esmolol, however, did not significantly shift the methacholine dose-response curve. Methacholine (0.3 mg/ml) increased resistance 4.0 +/- 0.89 cmH2O.l-1.s-1 during esmolol administration. This study shows that at equipotent beta 1-blocking doses, propranolol, but not esmolol, produces significant increases in pulmonary reactivity to methacholine.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine if fentanyl and sufentanil could produce dose-related suppression of hemodynamic and hormonal responses to surgical stimulation. Eighty patients scheduled for elective CABG were studied in two consecutive protocols: protocol I was a randomized double-blind study of 40 patients who received a single dose of fentanyl (50 or 100 micrograms/kg) or sufentanil (10, 20, or 30 micrograms/kg). Hemodynamic measurements and hormonal concentrations (renin, aldosterone, cortisol, and catecholamines) were determined before and after induction and after intubation and sternotomy. Protocol II was an open randomized study of 40 patients who received sufentanil in one of four doses: 30 micrograms/kg as a single dose, 10 micrograms/kg plus infusion 0.05 microgram.kg-1.min-1, 20 micrograms/kg plus infusion 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1, or 40 micrograms/kg plus infusion 0.2 microgram.kg-1.min-1. Hemodynamic measurements and plasma sufentanil and catecholamine concentrations were determined before and after induction and after intubation, sternotomy, and aortic cannulation. Both protocols defined a hemodynamic response as a 15% or more increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from control and a hormonal response 50% or more increase over control. During protocol I, 18 patients had a hemodynamic response (average increase in SBP 22.6 +/- 2%) and 35 patients had a total of 59 hormonal responses. During protocol II, 24 patients had a hemodynamic response (average increase in SBP - 31 +/- 3%) and there were 15 catecholamine responses. There were no differences between dose groups in either protocol. It was concluded that in these dose ranges, suppression of hemodynamic or hormonal stress responses is not related to opioid dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DESIGN: Two prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials to evaluate dose response in patients receiving adenosine and to compare the effects of adenosine with those of verapamil. PATIENTS: A total of 359 patients with a tachycardia electrocardiographically consistent with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia were entered into the two protocols. Patients subsequently found to have arrhythmias other than paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia were excluded from the efficacy analysis. INTERVENTIONS: The first protocol compared sequential intravenous bolus doses of 3, 6, 9, and 12 mg of adenosine to equal volumes of saline. In the second protocol, patients received either 6 mg and, if necessary, 12 mg of adenosine or 5 mg and, if necessary, 7.5 mg of verapamil. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: When data are expressed in terms of cumulative response in eligible patients, intravenous adenosine terminated acute episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in 35.2%, 62.3%, 80.2%, and 91.4% of patients who received maximum doses of 3, 6, 9, and 12 mg, respectively, in a four-dose sequence, whereas 8.9%, 10.7%, 14.3%, and 16.1% of patients responded to four sequential placebo doses (P less than 0.0001). In the second trial, cumulative response rates after 6 mg followed, if necessary, by 12 mg of adenosine were 57.4% and 93.4%, and after 5 mg followed, if necessary, by 7.5 mg of verapamil were 81.3% and 91.4%. The average time after injection to termination of tachycardia by adenosine was 30 seconds. Adenosine caused adverse effects in 36% of patients, but they lasted less than 1 minute and were usually mild. CONCLUSIONS: Adenosine in graded doses up to 12 mg rapidly and effectively terminates acute episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in which the atrioventricular node is an integral part of the re-entrant circuit. The overall efficacy of adenosine is similar to that of verapamil, but its onset of action is more rapid. Adverse reactions to adenosine are common but are minor and brief.\r"

SETTING: Three university-based AIDS Clinical Trials Units sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). PATIENTS: Forty-one patients with AIDS-related CMV disease. Previous therapy with either zidovudine or ganciclovir was allowed. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with zidovudine, 600 to 1200 mg/d; or, if on ganciclovir maintenance, ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg body weight; blood was sampled for pharmacokinetic studies. The other drug was then administered to the patient with blood sampling and, finally, the two drugs in combination were given. Patients were continued on both drug therapies with dose reduction of zidovudine only for grade 3 or 4 toxicity. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty patients were eligible. Hematologic toxicity was frequent, with 9 of the 10 patients requiring dose reductions for grade 3 or 4 toxicity at zidovudine doses of 1200 mg/d. With zidovudine doses of 600 mg/d, 82% experienced such hematologic toxicity. Median survival was 6 months; 10 patients developed intercurrent infection and 19, progressive CMV disease. Pharmacokinetic variables (alpha and beta half-lives, volume of distribution, clearance) were not affected in combination therapy. CONCLUSION: The combination of zidovudine and ganciclovir is poorly tolerated in patients with AIDS and serious-CMV disease, with 82% developing severe to life-threatening hematologic toxicity. Such toxicity is not a result of pharmacologic interactions, drug metabolism, or excretion.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: English-language literature search using MEDLINE, Index Medicus, and bibliographic reviews of major texts and all pertinent articles. STUDY SELECTION: For pentoxifylline, randomized, double-blind controlled trials were selected. For exercise, all controlled trials were selected, because few randomized trials have been done. For smoking cessation, 26 pertinent studies were selected after an exhaustive search. DATA EXTRACTION: Study quality was evaluated; therapeutic efficacy was estimated for pentoxifylline and exercise using meta-analytic techniques. For smoking cessation, all outcomes were determined and described. RESULTS: For pentoxifylline, insufficiently reported data led to marked disparity in effect sizes, preventing a meaningful pooled estimate of effectiveness. The results for exercise therapy suggested that dynamic exercise is beneficial (pooled effect size for pain-free walking distance = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.5; P less than 0.0001). Finally, smoking cessation was associated with a reduced frequency of complications due to progressive disease and improved postoperative graft patency rates. CONCLUSIONS: The limited amount and quality of reported data precluded an overall, reliable estimate of pentoxifylline's efficacy. Structured exercise programs increased pain-free walking distance, and smoking cessation improved postoperative graft patency rates and reduced the complications of peripheral arterial disease.\r"

  ".W": "In studies in experimental animals and in edematous patients, the nonosmotic release of vasopressin has been found to be consistently associated with activation of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems. Moreover, the sympathetic nervous system is known to modulate the nonosmotic release of vasopressin and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These findings led to our proposal that body fluid volume regulation involves dynamic interaction between cardiac output and peripheral arterial resistance. In this context, neither total extracellular fluid volume nor total blood volume are determinants of renal sodium and water excretion. With a decrease in effective arterial blood volume (EABV) initiated by either decreased cardiac output or peripheral arterial vasodilation, the acute response involves vasoconstriction mediated by angiotensin, sympathetic mediators, and vasopressin. The renal vasoconstriction, which accompanies either decreased cardiac output or peripheral arterial vasodilation, causes a decreased distal tubular delivery of sodium and water, thus maximizing the water-retaining effect of vasopressin and impairing normal escape from the sodium-retaining effect of aldosterone. The elevated glomerular filtration rate and filtered sodium load seen in pregnant women allow increased distal sodium and water delivery despite a decrease in EABV, thus limiting edema formation during gestation.\r"

  ".W": "Only 6 patients with intracranial hypertension associated with unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations have been reported. We report 6 additional patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic during the past 10 years. The average age was 28 years (range, 19-44 years); 4 were women. Symptoms and signs included papilledema (6 patients), headache (6), transient nonepileptic focal symptoms (4), visual obscurations (3), ipsilateral carotid or ocular bruits (3), abnormal visual fields (3), focal seizures (2), and progressive visual loss (1). Enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the malformations in all 6 patients. The malformations were large, supplied by the branches of the middle and anterior cerebral arteries, with the posterior cerebral artery contributing in 3 patients, and all drained into the superior sagittal sinus. Associated venous obstruction was seen in 2 patients. Four patients underwent excision of the arteriovenous malformation, with resolution of papilledema in all 4. Measurements of cortical arterial and venous pressures during surgery in 3 patients showed decreased feeding artery pressures and elevated draining vein pressures, which normalized after removal of the malformation. Treatment in the 2 remaining patients consisted of medical therapy (acetazolamide, furosemide, steroids) alone in 1 patient, and in conjunction with proton beam radiation in the other. Papilledema resolved in the former patient, but the patient receiving proton beam radiation still had papilledema 2 years later. Intracranial hypertension associated with unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations occurs in young patients with high flow malformations that drain into the superior sagittal sinus, and is likely the result of increased cortical venous and superior sagittal sinus pressure. Excision of the malformation effectively reduces the intracranial pressure.\r"

These neuropathological changes produced major reductions (70-80%) in the density of muscarinic cholinergic, glycine/strychnine, and central-type benzodiazepine receptors in the ventral horn motor nuclei. The density of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors and adenosine A1 receptors was dramatically increased (250-300%) in the lateral and ventral spinal columns, reflecting the proliferation of glial cells. Bovine Akabane disease represents a useful model for assessing the processes and consequences of neuronal degeneration and demyelination and has implications for human diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\r"

We measured outcome by mortality, histological damage by light microscopy, and learning ability on an eight-arm maze, and determined the drug's mechanism of action by an immunohistochemical assay of calcium-calmodulin binding. High-dose treatment begun prior to ischemia resulted in reduced cellular damage in severely ischemic hippocampal tissue, but also caused high mortality due to respiratory depression. Treatment begun 30 minutes after ischemia resulted in little histological protection but significantly improved learning ability when tested 1 month after ischemia, and did not increase mortality. Furthermore, CGS-19755, 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally, begun either before or after ischemia substantially reduced calcium influx into ischemic neurons as evidenced by reduced calcium-calmodulin binding. We conclude that CGS-19755 prevents calcium entry into ischemic neurons and may be effective therapy for very acute cerebral ischemia.\r"

We investigated the possible role of these receptors in modulating the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in rats. (R) SCH-23390 produced up to a 50% decrease in net CSF production, compared to saline. This compound is a partial agonist at 5-HT1c serotonin receptors, and an antagonist at D1 dopamine receptors.

Different doses of piperacillin and tazobactam, as single agents and combined (8:1 ratio; dosage range, 40/5 to 200/25 mg/kg per h), and of ceftriaxone were given to experimentally infected rabbits by intravenous bolus injection followed by a 5-h constant infusion. The mean (+/- standard deviation) rates for penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid of infected animals after coadministration of both drugs were 16.6 +/- 8.4% for piperacillin and 32.5 +/- 12.6% for tazobactam. Compared with either agent alone, combination treatment resulted in significantly better bactericidal activity in the cerebrospinal fluid. The bactericidal activity of piperacillin-tazobactam was dose dependent: cerebrospinal fluid bacterial titers were reduced by 0.37 +/- 0.19 log10 CFU/ml per h with the lowest dose versus 0.96 +/- 0.25 log10 CFU/ml per h with the highest dose (P less than 0.001). At the relatively high doses of 160/20 and 200/25 mg of piperacillin-tazobactam per kg per h, the bactericidal activity of the combination was comparable to that of 10 and 25 mg of ceftriaxone per kg per h, respectively.\r"

Among the isolates (most of which caused urinary tract infections), 78% were Amr and 22% were Ami by the interpretative criteria established by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Resistance to carboxypenicillins ranged from 73 to 74%, and that to acylureidopenicillins ranged from 43 to 66%. A total of 26% of the isolates were resistant to cephalothin, and 4% were resistant to cefazolin. Resistance to cefoxitin was 1%, while resistances to cefuroxime and cefamandole were 2 and 7%, respectively. With the exception of cefsulodin (98% resistant) and cefoperazone (1% resistant), there was no resistance to newer cephalosporins or aztreonam. In general, only minor differences in the incidence of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics were noted in hospital-acquired versus non-hospital-acquired isolates as well as among isolates from various regions of the United States. TEM beta-lactamases were produced by 87% of the 237 Amr isolates examined. By our methods, OXA and chromosomal (type I) beta-lactamases were detected in 2 and 28 isolates, respectively, and plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum cephalosporinases were detected in none of the isolates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

CD-1 mice (5 weeks old) were injected intravenously with 3 x 10(5) Candida albicans yeast cells. Intraperitoneal LY or amphotericin B (AmB) therapy was begun 4 days after infection and was continued daily for 2 weeks. LY and AmB were compared at 62.5, 6.25, and 0.625 mg/kg per day, with the LY dose split into two treatments per day. Mice were observed for 30 days postinfection, and survivors were necropsied. AmB at 62.5 mg/kg per day was lethal in the absence of infection. Cumulative mortality for infected controls was 94% (17 of 18). Survival of mice treated with the control diluent for LY was the same as survival with no treatment. Survival after 0.625 mg of LY per kg per day was the same as that of the controls, and 6.25 or 62.5 mg of LY per kg per day was significantly superior. AmB treatment at 0.625 or 6.25 mg/kg per day was protective and superior to the same LY doses. Atrophied kidneys were common in AmB-treated mice, and mice treated with 6.25 mg of AmB per kg per day appeared ill during therapy. The number of CFU recovered from kidneys and spleens of surviving mice reflected the same relationships between drugs and doses as those described for mortality. C. albicans was not cleared from the kidneys of mice in any group, and only in the 6.25-mg/kg-per-day AmB treatment group was not detectable C. albicans found in the spleens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

MICs of these agents for typical S. marcescens isolates were 1 to 8, 0.25 to 0.5, and 0.03 micrograms/ml, respectively. The two isolates were fully susceptible to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, and only one was highly resistant to ampicillin and carbenicillin (MICs, greater than 1,024 micrograms/ml). Both isolates had beta-lactamases that focused at pIs 8.2 and 9.7. The penicillin-resistant isolate additionally produced the TEM-1 enzyme. The enzymes with pIs of 8.2 and 9.7 were separated by cation-exchange chromatography. The pI 8.2 beta-lactamase was a class I enzyme of the type found in most S. marcescens isolates. It was almost inactive against carbapenems and penems, as was the class I enzyme from another S. marcescens strain. The pI 9.7 enzyme hydrolyzed penems and carbapenems rapidly: kcat (turnover number) values for FCE 22101, imipenem, and meropenem were 3.4, 26, and 1% of the kcat value for cephaloridine, respectively; kcat/Km values were 140, 915, and 150% of the kcat/Km value for cephaloridine, respectively. Otherwise, the pI 9.7 enzyme had predominantly penicillinase activity.

Concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin in serum and concentrations of histamine in plasma were measured at baseline and during and after each infusion. Erythema and pruritus were classified a priori as mild, moderate, or severe. The extent of erythema was determined by the use of a burn chart, and pruritus was assessed by the subject with a rank scale. Global severity of RMS was determined by summation of the individual scores for pruritus and erythema. Baseline areas under the concentration-time curve for histamine were not significantly different for the vancomycin and teicoplanin treatments. Vancomycin caused RMS in 11 of 12 subjects (9 severe and 2 moderate cases) and was associated with a significant increase in plasma histamine (46.7 +/- 31.3 ng.min/ml, P less than 0.05). In contrast, teicoplanin did not cause RMS or elicit significant histamine release (8.7 +/- 13.2 ng.min/ml). Peak concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin in serum were 58.8 +/- 8.4 and 148.0 +/- 31.8 micrograms/ml, respectively (P less than 0.05). Assuming equal efficacy, these data suggest that teicoplanin may be a safe alternative agent in subjects experiencing severe RMS due to vancomycin; however, further studies in the clinical setting are needed.\r"

  ".W": "Susceptibility of Escherichia coli to kanamycin and seven other aminoglycosides has been found to be strongly potentiated by salicylate. At pH 7.5, in the presence of 15 mM salicylate and 0.5 micrograms of kanamycin per ml, the efficiency of plating of the bacteria was 2 x 10(-5), whereas there was no significant killing in the presence of kanamycin or salicylate alone. With 0.75 micrograms of kanamycin per ml, the addition of 2.5 mM salicylate was sufficient to reduce the efficiency of plating by more than 10(4)-fold. Synergistic effects were found also at pHs 6.5 and 8.5. To determine whether the action of salicylate resulted from its behavior as a weak acid or its salicyl structure, similar experiments were carried out with acetate and salicyl alcohol. Acetate, a membrane-permeating weak acid, showed a synergistic effect on kanamycin susceptibility at pH 6.5 that was comparable to the effect seen with salicylate at pH 6.5. However, acetate had no synergistic effect with kanamycin at pH 7.5 or 8.5. This is consistent with the ability of acetate to increase the membrane potential of cells and the dependence of susceptibility to kanamycin and other aminoglycosides on the membrane potential. Salicyl alcohol, which has a hydroxyl group in the place of the carboxyl group that is present in salicylate, was an effective synergist with kanamycin. It was equally effective at pHs 6.5 and 7.5 and somewhat more effective at pH 8.5. These results support the hypothesis that two effects are involved in the synergy between aminoglycosides and salicylate: a weak acid effect, possibly to increase the membrane potential, and an uncharacterized effect related to the salicyl structure.\r"

Oligomers with longer chain lengths were more active against HSV-2 than those with shorter ones. Of all the compounds examined, the 28-mer phosphorothioate homo-oligodeoxynucleotides were the strongest inhibitors of HSV-2. The degree of inhibition was related to the base moiety on the order of deoxycytidine = thymidine greater than deoxyadenosine. The inhibition of HSV-2 growth by S-dC28 was dose dependent with a 90% inhibitory dose of 1 microM. At 50 microM, S-dC28 inhibited HeLa S3 cell growth by less than 10%. The anti-HSV-2 activity was time and schedule dependent. The oligomer was most inhibitory to viral growth when present during the 1-h viral adsorption period, and this effect could be enhanced by continuous drug exposure after the adsorption period. S-dC28 was also an effective inhibitor of two HSV-2 drug-resistant mutants: a phosphonoformate-resistant mutant that induces an altered DNA polymerase and a 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine-resistant mutant that does not induce the viral thymidine kinase. In drug combination studies, phosphonoformate was shown to potentiate the action of S-dC28 against HSV-2 growth. In conclusion, because of their potency and selectivity, phosphorothioate homo-oligodeoxynucleotides are a promising new class of anti-HSV agents.\r"

  ".W": "A cytochrome P-450-deficient mutant of Candida albicans, strain D10, was employed to study the mode of action of imidazole antifungal agents. This mutant accumulates exclusively 14-alpha-methylsterols, resulting in a sterol profile which mimics that of azole-treated wild-type strains. Since the widely accepted primary effect of imidazoles is the inhibition of cytochrome P-450-mediated demethylation of the ergosterol precursor lanosterol, strain D10 and its wild-type revertant, strain D10R, were grown in the presence of concentrations of clotrimazole, miconazole, and ketoconazole known to inhibit demethylation. The growth of strain D10 was unaffected by these antifungal agents, while that of strain D10R was significantly reduced. At higher azole concentrations (which are known to exert a direct, disruptive action on the cell membrane), the growth of both strains was immediately and completely inhibited by clotrimazole and miconazole. Ketoconazole was membrane disruptive only for strain D10; this is the first report of a direct membrane effect for this drug. Because hyphal formation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of C. albicans and because it has been shown to be inhibited by azoles, the hypha-forming capability of strain D10 was examined. Strain D10 was shown to be seriously defective in hyphal formation, suggesting that this function may be dependent on the 14-alpha-demethylation of lanosterol. The results of this study suggest that inhibition of lanosterol demethylation per se is neither fungicidal nor fungistatic, although the growth rate is reduced. In addition, the substitution of 14-alpha-methylsterols for ergosterol results in defective hyphal formation and in a cell that is more susceptible to membrane-active agents such as ketoconazole.\r"

Its functional form was a homodimer of two 16,000-dalton polypeptides, which possibly showed an antiparallel alpha tertiary structure and which lacked marked hydrophobic regions. Visualization of the reaction was achieved by precolumn derivatization of glutathione and the adduct, separation by high-performance liquid chromatography, and fluorescence detection of both compounds. Temperature and pH optima were 20 to 30 degrees C and 8.25, respectively; Mn2+, Fe2+, and Co2+ enhanced the rate of modification; and Km values were 9.4 and 11 mM for fosfomycin and glutathione, respectively. Phosphoenolpyruvate did not interfere with fosfomycin modification. The enzyme was stable at 4 degrees C for at least 6 months but progressively lost its activity upon being heated for 60 min at temperatures over 30 degrees C.\r"

The drugs were generally hydrophobic or amphiphilic. Polymyxin B nonapeptide, which has a known outer membrane permeabilizing action, further reduced the MIC of several of these agents for the SS-B strain by a factor of approximately 10 to 30. In most cases, the resulting MICs were lower than the corresponding MICs for the parent strain grown in the presence of polymyxin B nonapeptide. In addition, the hydrophobic fluorescent probe N-phenyl naphthylamine was rapidly embedded in the membranes of the SS-B strain but was poorly embedded in those of the parent strain.\r"

  ".W": "Seven extended-spectrum beta-lactamases related to TEM and four enzymes derived from SHV-1 were transferred to a common Escherichia coli host so that the activity of a variety of beta-lactams could be tested in a uniform genetic environment. For most derivatives, penicillinase activity was 10% or less than that of strains making TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 beta-lactamase, suggesting that reduced catalytic efficiency accompanied the broader substrate spectrum. Despite this deficit, resistance to aztreonam, carumonam, cefdinir, cefepime, cefixime, cefmenoxime, cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefpirome, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, ceftibuten, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, and E1040 was enhanced. For strains producing TEM-type enzymes, however, MICs of carumonam, cefepime, cefmenoxime, cefotiam, cefpirome, and ceftibuten were 8 micrograms/ml or less. Susceptibilities of cefmetazole, cefotetan, cefoxitin, flomoxef, imipenem, meropenem, moxalactam, temocillin, FCE 22101, and Sch 34343 were unaffected. FCE 22101, imipenem, meropenem, and Sch 34343 were inhibitory for all strains at 1 microgram/ml or less. In E. coli an OmpF- porin mutation in combination with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase enhanced resistance to many of these agents, but generally by only fourfold. Hyperproduction of chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase increased resistance to 7-alpha-methoxy beta-lactams but not that to temocillin. When tested at 8 micrograms/ml, clavulanate was more potent than sulbactam or tazobactam in overcoming resistance to ampicillin, while cefoperazone-sulbactam was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanate or piperacillin-tazobactam, especially against TEM-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.\r"

All but 5 of the 139 patients completed the full treatment schedule and became afebrile in the first week of therapy. Four patients suffered relapses during the follow-up period. Of the five patients who did not complete the treatment, two left because of adverse secondary effects (1.4%), another two left for noncomplicance with the treatment (1.4%), and the remaining patient was considered a therapeutic failure because his symptoms persisted after the first week of therapy (0.7%).

The antibacterial activity of the compound was compared directly with those of SQ 83,360 (pirazmonam) and aztreonam. U-78608, SQ 83,360, and aztreonam had generally poor activity against gram-positive aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. U-78608 demonstrated activity primarily against gram-negative aerobic bacteria, with potency generally comparable to that of SQ 83,360. U-78608 and SQ 83,360 were less active than aztreonam for some gram-negative species; however, both compounds were 8- to 64-fold more active than aztreonam against Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas maltophilia. All three compounds resisted inactivation by several different beta-lactamases from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Neither U-78608 nor SQ 83,360 exhibited significant inhibition of these enzymes, while aztreonam inhibited beta-lactamases from P. aeurginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. All three compounds exhibited strong affinity to PBP 3 of Escherichia coli and moderate to negligible affinity to the other E. coli PBPs; quantitative measurements indicated that U-78608 had greater PBP 3 affinity than either SQ 83,360 or aztreonam.\r"

Subjective assessment of [11C]L-methionine uptake closely paralleled results of quantitative examination (r = 0.81). [11C]L-methionine uptake in tumor-containing brain was increased in 11 patients (mean ratio of [11C] radioactivity in tumor to normal brain: 1.5 +/- 0.57; range: 1.13-2.98). Increased tracer uptake occurred in ependymomas (3), medulloblastoma (1), and astrocytomas (5), but was less intense in low-grade tumors. L-phenylalanine reduced L-methionine uptake (25-69%) in 70% of studies. L-methionine uptake was not sensitive to competitive inhibition in brain radiation injury. Two-phase METPET is of potential value in difficult clinical situations evident in children with brain tumors, including the differential diagnosis of tumor recurrence and cerebral radiation injury.\r"

The proportions with EBV-VCA IgA antibodies at a titer of greater than or equal to 128 rose during the course of HIV infection and progression of the disease: 8% in HIV seronegatives, 11% in HIV seronegatives with LAS, 25% in HIV seronegatives prior to HIV seroconversion, 44% in asymptomatic HIV seropositives, 34% in LAS, 50% in ARC, and 58% in AIDS patients. An increase in EBV-VCA IgG and IgA titers was detected following HIV seroconversion and in samples obtained 6 months before disease progression to LAS. These data suggest the possible involvement of EBV in the natural history of HIV infection and disease progression. The possibility that EBV-VCA IgA antibody levels would be of value in prediction of progression of HIV-related illness is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often causes latent infection. Transactivation by some DNA viruses has been implicated in inducing HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis. The transactivator (IE-2) gene of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) can enhance HIV-2 as well as HIV-1 gene expression in vitro. This inducer can act in concert with the HIV-2 tat gene and T-cell activation in enhancing gene expression in human CD4+ lymphocytes. While the HIV-2 and HIV-1 tat genes and T-cell activators apparently employ independent modes of action, the CMV transactivator in combination with the HIV-2 tat or T-cell activators may employ a gene activation pathway with some common and some distinct components. Both HIV-2 and CMV transactivators enhance HIV-2 gene expression by transcriptional activation involving transcript initiation as well as elongation, with CMV transactivator affecting elongation more than the initiation. A significant proportion of transcripts appear to terminate prematurely in the absence of transactivators. Deletion mutation analysis of the HIV-2 long terminal repeat (LTR) suggests that the element that responds to CMV transactivation in human CD4+ lymphocytes is either a diffuse one or located downstream of the HIV-2 enhancer element.\r"

Binding of TAR to the purified synthetase in vitro was abolished by addition of HIV-1 Tat protein, which binds to this sequence with a high affinity. Inhibition of TAR-mediated activation of (2'-5')A synthetase by Tat was prevented in the presence of the Zn2+ and Cd2+ chelators o-phenanthroline and penicillamine, which did not impair TAR-synthetase interaction. Transient expression assays of bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in HeLa cells revealed that the levels of both CAT mRNA and CAT protein decreased after treatment of the cells with interferon, if CAT gene was linked to HIV-1 TAR segment. Cotransfection of the cells with a tat sequence containing plasmid rendered CAT gene expression insensible to the action of interferon.\r"

These treatments inhibited virus replication at nanomolar drug levels with activities in the order ddC greater than ddCTP = L(ddCTP). Studies on drug stability and uptake suggest that a large part of the free ddCTP is dephosphorylated before entering the cells, whereas L(ddCTP) remains stable over days and is taken up, probably by endocytosis. The response to L(ddCTP) suggests that the capability of liposomes for targeting drugs to macrophages in vivo could potentially be exploited to improve the therapeutic index of dideoxynucleoside drugs.\r"

  ".W": "In summary, anaesthetics and drugs used perioperatively are all xenobiotics and can be metabolized mainly by microsomal enzyme systems, which have a high activity in the liver. These enzyme systems are induced by repeated pre-administration of drugs, such as barbiturates and others which are used during the preoperative period. However, according to some reports, aerobic and anaerobic metabolism is inhibited by the simultaneous administration of drugs, such as isoflurane and halothane, halothane and enflurane, and cimetidine and halothane. Hypoxia is also an important factor in hepatic disorders and it is well known that anaerobic metabolism of halothane is increased by hypoxia and its intermediate production produces a free radical. Theoretically, this free radical is involved in hepatic disorders. In practice, in order to prevent hepatic dysfunction before, during and after anaesthesia, hypoxia and repeated pre-administration of enzyme-inducing drugs should be avoided. However, the choice and combination of drugs which inhibit drug metabolism and prevent hepato and/or nephro toxicity should be examined by further investigation.\r"

It is now possible to monitor and apply many pulmonary function tests at the bedside that were once confined to the laboratory.\r"

Preoperative optimization of concurrent medical conditions with aggressive physical and medical therapy. 4. Careful titration of intra-operative fluids with early recourse to invasive monitoring, vasopressors and inotropes. Perioperative digitalization of patients with a history of cardiovascular disease for pneumonectomy. 5. Avoidance of N2O. Ventilate intraoperatively with an air/oxygen mixture, during both two- and one-lung ventilation, titrated against the arterial oxygen saturation. Avoidance of complete intraoperative atelectasis of the ND-lung with a low level of air/oxygen CPAP. 6. Surgical alternatives. The use of a median sternotomy or limited resection. A simple cost/benefit analysis tells us that not every recent advance in thoracic anaesthesia is indicated for every patient.

DESIGN: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either conventional or two-dimensional ultrasound-guided internal jugular vein cannulation. Patients who could not be cannulated with five or fewer passes by either technique, were crossed over to the other technique. SETTING: Clinical research unit in a tertiary care center. PATIENTS: All consecutive patients who required urgent or urgent-elective internal jugular vein cannulation during the study period. INTERVENTIONS: The two-dimensional ultrasound transducer imaged all cannulation attempts. For patients randomized to ultrasound guidance, the operator viewed two-dimensional ultrasound images, and received verbal guidance from the ultrasound technician. For patients randomized to the conventional arm, two-dimensional ultrasound images were recorded without visual or verbal feedback. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two-dimensional ultrasound was significantly better than conventional guidance in reducing the number of failed site cannulations from 6/17 (35 percent), to 0/12 (0 percent), p less than 0.05. Two-dimensional ultrasound also reduced the mean number of passes required to cannulate the vein from 3.12 to 1.75 (p less than .05), and was also successful in six/six (100) of patients who failed cannulation by conventional means (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Intensivists can increase successful internal jugular vein cannulation using ultrasound guidance. Two-dimensional ultrasound should be considered for patients difficult to cannulate or those at high risk of cannulation complications.\r"

Secondary neurologic insult can be decreased by cardiorespiratory support and ICP control from the outset. Rapid neurologic assessment, airway management, and support of circulation are the basis of emergency management for head injury. Patients with severe head injury require intensive care management for two major reasons: management of ICP and management of organ system dysfunction. Care should not be withheld because of initially grim (and inaccurate) prognostic assessment. Newer techniques for assessing the adequacy of cerebral circulation may allow refinement of management strategies in the future.\r"

Pathologic examination of the resected tumor only showed immature teratoma. The serum AFP level returned to normal and remained so three months after the operation. This experience suggests that in patients with nonseminomatous GCT treated with combination chemotherapy, measurements of tumor volume alone do not provide information regarding the tumor's response.

  ".W": "After almost 50 years as first-line drugs in the management of asthma and COPD, methylxanthines have been largely superceded by inhaled adrenoceptor agonist and anticholinergic bronchodilators which are more potent and far less toxic. Accumulating evidence indicates that intravenous theophylline contributes side effects, but is rarely of benefit in acute exacerbations of asthma or COPD. In the maintenance therapy of asthma, first-line therapy is dose-optimized inhaled steroids, reducing the need for bronchodilators. Inhaled adrenoceptor agonists are second line medications, anticholinergic aerosols third line, and theophylline, if needed at all, may fulfill a minor systemic steroid-sparing function in severe asthmatics on maximum doses of the inhaled medications. In the maintenance therapy of some patients with COPD, theophylline sometimes may be useful but these responders should be identified by objectively establishing therapeutic benefit. Since many patients have side effects from the methylxanthines, while their therapeutic benefit over and above dose-optimized inhaled therapy is marginal, their continued almost routine use in the management of reversible airflow obstruction is hard to justify, although this class of drugs may be useful in selected patients in whom both subjective and objective benefit can be demonstrated. In COPD, theophylline may improve exercise capacity in some patients by still incompletely understood mechanisms probably unrelated to bronchodilation.\r"

Since a short-term \"placebo\" effect attends many therapies, this report describes results of transrectal excision only after a three-year postoperative period. Delorme's transrectal excision of internal intussusception accomplished sustained symptomatic relief in over 70 percent of otherwise refractory constipated patients. The association of internal intussusception with other abnormalities underscores the importance of defining both anatomic and functional components when selecting patients whose constipation may require surgical therapy. Critical technical elements, surgical pitfalls, and potential complications of the procedure are discussed.\r"

Each patient presented with chronic constipation requiring enemas, cathartics, and multiple hospital admissions for management. Diagnosis in each case was made with barium enema and full-thickness rectal biopsy. Four patients underwent endorectal pull-through procedures, all with good long-term results. The fifth patient, initially treated with a Duhamel retrorectal pull-through procedure, required reoperation for constipation secondary to a retained rectal septum. Review of 199 cases of adult Hirschsprung's disease enables comparison of the various operative procedures for this disorder with respect to postoperative complications and functional outcomes. Anorectal myectomy with low anterior resection, the Duhamel-Martin procedure, and the Soave endorectal pull-through procedure are the most acceptable methods for surgical management.\r"

  ".U": "90298845\r", 
  ".W": "In order to compare prohormone processing in two distinct pituitary cell types, somatomammotrope cells (GH3) and corticotrope cells (AtT-20) were stably transfected with vectors encoding preproneuropeptide Y (preproNPY) containing four different pairs of basic amino acids at the single endoproteolytic cleavage site: wildtype or KR (lysine-arginine), RR, RK, and KK. The GH-NPY cell lines cleaved proNPY to a similar extent, regardless of the sequence of the basic amino acids at the cleavage site (KR = RR = RK = KK). AtT-20-NPY cells are known to exhibit a strong hierarchy of cleavage site preference when processing wildtype and mutated proNPY forms (KR = RR greater than RK much greater than KK). All four types of GH-NPY and AtT-NPY cells faithfully produced NPY (1-36) NH2 from proNPY (1-69), regardless of the amino acid sequence at the cleavage site. All four types of GH-NPY cells produced some of the expected proNPY-COOH-terminal peptide with Ser40 at its NH2-terminal [proNPY (40-69)]. GH3 cells expressing the RR, RK, and KK forms of proNPY yielded in addition some proNPY-COOH-terminal peptide retaining the amino terminals Lys39 or Arg39 residue. In contrast, AtT-NPY-RK cells produced only the Lys39 form of proNPY-COOH-terminal peptide while the other three AtT-NPY lines (KR, RR, and KK) produced only the Ser40 form of proNPY-COOH-terminal peptide. The residence time of proNPY and NPY in GH3 cells was dramatically increased by treatment with insulin, estradiol, and epidermal growth factor, in concert with the expected increase in PRL synthesis and decrease in GH synthesis; increased residence time in the cells did not result in an increase in the extent of cleavage of proNPY to NPY. AtT-20 cells did not respond to the somatomammotrope-specific set of hormones. Thus, there are several important differences in the posttranslational processing and storage of peptide hormones in corticotropes and somatomammotropes.\r"

  ".U": "90298864\r", 
  ".W": "We recently reported isolation, characterization and synthesis of a novel ovine hypothalamic peptide with 38 residues which stimulates accumulation of cAMP in rat anterior pituitary cell cultures. The peptide was named PACAP38 (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide with 38 residues). The presence of another peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 1-27 residues (PACAP27) was also demonstrated. Both PACAP38 and PACAP27 have an amidated C-terminus. Antisera against synthetic PACAP27 were generated in rabbits. These antisera were tested for titer and specificity in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. One of the antisera (no. 88121-3) exhibited a high titer of antibody, which was specific to PACAP27 and PACAP38 with exception of slight cross-reactivity with ovine CRF (oCRF). Therefore, the antibodies against oCRF were removed from the antiserum using a solid phase method. Removal of oCRF antibodies was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A dense immunoreactive fiber network was found in both external and internal zones of the median eminence and pituitary stalk. The fibers were demonstrated to be in close contact with the hypophysial portal capillaries. The preabsorption of antiserum with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide or with the mixture containing TRH, LHRH, oCRF, ovine GH-releasing factor, somatostatin, and bovine thyroglobulin did not affect the immunostaining. On the other hand, the preabsorption of antiserum with an excess of PACAP27 or PACAP38 abolished the immunostaining. Therefore, the staining is considered specific for PACAP27 and PACAP38. Stained fibers were also present in the posterior pituitary. A dense fiber network was observed and the lateral hypothalamus the fibers appeared to cling to unstained neuronal cell bodies and their dendrites. In the lateral septum the fibers surrounded some blood vessels. Immunolabeled cell bodies were found in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. These findings support the view that PACAP may play a multifunctional role, including that of a hypophysiotropic hormone, neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, and vasoregulator.\r"

To do this, [125I]CBG, [125I] asialo-CBG, and [125I]asialofetuin were used as probes to differentiate the binding activities of the two receptors. On hepatic membranes, CBG bound to a single set of sites with a Kd of 0.74 microM, asialofetuin bound to a single set of sites with a Kd of 0.018 microM, asialo-CBG bound to two sets of sites with Kd values of 0.004 and 1.4 microM and in the presence of 1 microM asialofetium, asialo-CBG bound to a single set of sites with a Kd of 0.53 microM, not different (P greater than 0.2) from the Kd of CBG. Cross-competition studies using the three 125I-labeled ligands and allowing each to compete with the three radioinert ligands indicated the existence of two separate receptors. Desialylation of hepatic membranes differentially affected the binding of CBG and asialofetuin. Finally, whole cells bound CBG specifically, but internalized it to only a minimal extent (less than 10%). This observation does not support a role for the CBG-receptor system in the entry of steroids into cells.\r"

  ".W": "Cold stress stimulates the release of both ACTH and TSH from the pituitary. More striking changes in ACTH content have been seen in the intermediate lobe after cold stress. Therefore, this study was designed to test responses of individual anterior lobe corticotropes to cold exposure. Male rats were exposed to either 30 min of cold (+3-5 C), 30 min of a novel, temperate environment (+24 C) or were unstressed (+24 C). Pituitaries were fixed and embedded in preparation for immunolabeling for ACTH or TSH-beta at the light (semithin sections) and electron microscopic levels. The semithin sections were used to measure areas of corticotropes and thyrotropes with Bioquant image analysis equipment. Separate groups of pituitaries were dissociated and the cells were cultured for 2 or 15 h. Then the cells were stimulated for 5-10 min with biotinylated analogs of corticotropin-releasing hormone (bio-CRH) or arginine vasopressin (bio-AVP) to detect the target cells cytochemically. A third group of dissociated cells were fixed for immunolabeling for ACTH, 16K fragment of pro-opiomelanocortin, beta-endorphin, or TSH-beta. Cold exposure resulted in a 1-4-fold increase in the levels of serum ACTH over that of unstressed rats. This was correlated with a 40% increase in the percentage of cells that contained 16K fragment and a 30-40% increase in percentages of cells storing ACTH or beta-endorphin. Cold stress also increased the percentage of cells that bound bio-CRH or bio-AVP by 45%. Analyses of semithin sections showed that areas of corticotropes increased by 21% following cold stress. The number of rows of immunolabeled (ACTH) secretion granules also increased in corticotropes from cold-stressed rats. Exposure to a novel environment for 30 min resulted in no significant increase in serum ACTH over that of unstressed rats. There was, however, a 20% increase in percentages of cells that stored 16K fragment, beta-endorphin, or target cells that bound bio-CRH. However, the corticotropes were not significantly larger. Many of the cells exhibited reduced numbers of immunolabeled secretory granules. Other corticotropes resembled those from cold-stressed rats. When TSH cells were studied, their percentages increased from 8 +/- 3% to 15.8 +/- 4% and their areas increased by 22% following exposure to cold. After exposure to a novel environment, percentages of cells that stored TSH-beta increased to 11 +/- 2%, however, no changes in areas of TSH cells were measured. These studies demonstrated that the anterior lobe corticotrope is clearly activated by exposure to both cold and novel environment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We examined GnRH metabolism by pituitary cells in vitro and the metabolism of exogenously administered GnRH in vivo in the presence and absence of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). Ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys were implanted with E2- and/or P4-filled Silastic capsules to simulate the estrogen and progesterone patterns of the normal menstrual cycle. Peripheral levels of GnRH after a 1-microgram iv injection were highest in the E2-replaced monkeys. Peripheral GnRH levels reached a higher peak and remained in circulation longer in monkeys treated with E2-filled Silastic implants than in those treated with E2 plus P4 or nonsteroid-replaced ovariectomized monkeys. In agreement with the in vivo data, GnRH was rapidly metabolized by acutely dispersed cells isolated from pituitaries removed from nonsteroid-replaced ovariectomized monkeys. Priming with E2 followed by P4 in vivo attenuated the clearance of GnRH in vitro, and E2 treatment alone almost completely blocked the ability of pituitary cells to bind and/or degrade GnRH in vitro. In a parallel study, cells prepared from rat pituitaries removed on the morning of proestrus (when serum E2 is highest) metabolized GnRH in vitro more slowly than pituitary cells removed at estrus, diestrus, or metestrus. In summary, our data suggest that E2 inhibits GnRH metabolism by monkey and rat pituitary cells in vitro and exogenously administered GnRH in vivo. Although the precise mechanism of action of E2 is unknown, inhibition of membrane-bound and serum proteases seems likely. The action of E2 may be to increase GnRH presentation to the pituitary and enhance LH and FSH secretion under conditions where circulating levels of the hormone are elevated, such as at midcycle.\r"

  ".U": "90298879\r", 
  ".W": "Although hypothalamic GnRH release is known to be modulated by neural and hormonal factors, the relationship between altered GnRH secretion and GnRH synthesis remains unclear. In an attempt to address this question, we examined GnRH gene expression in the rat hypothalamus using in situ hybridization histochemistry. An 25S-labeled antisense RNA probe was used to identify neurons expressing GnRH mRNA in an area that included the diagonal band of Broca, the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, and the preoptic area. The number of GnRH mRNA-expressing cells was determined at various times during the rat estrous cycle. During proestrus, the number of GnRH mRNA-expressing cells decreased somewhat at 1400-1600 h, increased significantly at 1800 h (the time of the LH surge), then gradually returned to basal levels at 2200 h. Expression did not change substantially at other times during the estrous cycle. To understand this close temporal relationship between the LH surge and increased GnRH mRNA levels, we examined GnRH gene expression in proestrous animals in which the LH surge was blocked with pentobarbital. Pentobarbital treatment blocked the increase in the number of GnRH mRNA-expressing cells normally observed at 1800 h in saline-treated controls, suggesting that the increase in GnRH gene expression is closely coupled to secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus. Finally, we addressed the question of whether ovarian steroids have direct effects on GnRH gene expression by examining GnRH mRNA levels in ovariectomized steroid-treated rats at a time before (1100 h) and a time after (1800 h) hypothalamic GnRH hypersecretion. At 1100 h, no significant changes were observed, but at 1800 h, estrogen-treated rats showed a significant increase in both the number of GnRH mRNA-expressing cells and serum LH levels. This suggests that estrogen influences GnRH gene expression indirectly, perhaps by altering hypothalamic GnRH release. Our results in each of these models suggest that GnRH mRNA levels increase in response to GnRH hypersecretion at the time of the LH surge.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of protein kinase-C (PKC) inhibition on insulin receptor phosphorylation in HepG2 cells was analyzed by two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps. In basal cells, there was one major insulin receptor-derived tryptic phosphothreonine peptide and at least four phosphoserine peptides. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) stimulated phosphorylation of the phosphothreonine peptide, some of the basal phosphoserine peptides, and at least one phosphoserine peptide that was not detected in the basal state. Staurosporine completely inhibited the PDBU-mediated phosphorylation. Although staurosporine also inhibited basal phosphorylation of the phosphothreonine peptide, down-regulation of PKC did not, suggesting that PKC does not mediate basal insulin receptor phosphorylation. Insulin treatment resulted in the appearance of four phosphotyrosine peptides. It also stimulated the phosphorylation of at least two phosphoserine peptides. One of these may have been a complex of two or more distinct but poorly resolved phosphopeptides, which was seen in basal cells and a component of which seemed to be stimulated by PDBU. However, neither staurosporine nor down-regulation of PKC diminished insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of these peptides, indicating that insulin-stimulated receptor serine phosphorylation did not involve PKC activity. The addition of staurosporine to cells that had been incubated with PDBU resulted in the very rapid decay of phosphorylation of the phosphothreonine-containing peptide, indicating that this site of phosphorylation turns over very rapidly, while some of the other phosphoserine-containing peptides, including the major unique site of phosphorylation stimulated by PDBU, turned over more slowly. Thus, the insulin receptor contains several sites of serine/threonine phosphorylation, some of which are substrates for more than one protein kinase. This may permit complex modulation of insulin receptor functions in response to multiple signalling pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor binding-proteins 1 and 2 (IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2) and endothelial cell IGF binding proteins (ECBP) were individually perfused through isolated beating rat hearts in the absence and presence of insulin. Insulin caused an increased movement of IGFBP-1 from the vascular space to tissues of the heart. Subendothelial content of IGFBP-1 was 110%, 126% (p less than .01) and 132% (p less than 0.05) of control hearts when perfused with 1, 10 and 100 ng/ml insulin, respectively. . In contrast, insulin treatment was associated with a decrease in ECBP content in cardiac tissue, being 83%, 62% (p less than 0.005) and 73% (p less than 0.05) of control when perfused with 1, 10 and 100 ng/ml insulin. The efflux of IGFBP-2 from the intravascular space was unaffected by insulin. The subendothelial tissue distribution of the transported binding proteins was not changed by insulin perfusion, with IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 localizing predominantly in cardiac muscle and ECBP having greater affinity for connective tissue elements. We conclude that in the perfused rat heart, insulin can differentially alter transcapillary movement of IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2 and endothelial cell IGF-binding proteins. Such insulin-facilitated changes could potentially mediate nutrient-dependent transport of IGF-I and IGF-II to peripheral tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Extensive remodeling of the follicular extracellular matrix occurs during the process of ovulation. This remodeling involves the breakdown of collagen, which is regulated, in part, by the action of the metalloproteinase collagenase and its associated inhibitors. In the present study, follicular metalloproteinase inhibitors were characterized to determine whether they were serum-borne or of ovarian origin, possibly a tissue-derived inhibitor known as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP). Human follicular fluid and granulosa cells were obtained from preovulatory follicles of patients in an in vitro fertilization program. Chromatographic separation of follicular fluid on Sepharose 6B resulted in two peaks of inhibitory activity. The large molecular radius (Mr) inhibitor was similar in size to the serum-borne metalloproteinase inhibitor alpha 2-macroglobulin (i.e. Mr 700,000) whereas the small Mr inhibitor approximated the size of TIMP (i.e. Mr 29,000). Incubation of aliquots from either of the two peaks of inhibitor activity or an alpha 2-macroglobulin standard with an antibody to alpha 2-macroglobulin decreased the inhibitory activity in both the large Mr peak and the alpha 2-macroglobulin standard by 86.6 +/- 1.7% and 71.5 +/- 7.7% (n = 4, P less than 0.005), respectively, implying cross-reactivity with the alpha 2-macroglobulin antibody. The inhibitory activity in the small Mr peak, however, was unchanged. Northern analysis of total granulosa cell RNA demonstrated TIMP messenger RNA (mRNA) in all eight granulosa cell samples examined whereas alpha 2-macroglobulin mRNA was virtually undetectable. A positive correlation (r = 0.85, P less than 0.01) was observed between the levels of TIMP mRNA and the ratio of the follicular estradiol-progesterone concentration. However, inhibitor activity in the follicular fluid was not correlated with the levels of TIMP mRNA (r = 0.05). These findings confirm the presence of alpha 2-macroglobulin in follicular fluid and demonstrate that human preovulatory granulosa cells contain mRNA for TIMP, an inhibitor that regulates metalloproteinases such as collagenase, gelatinase, and proteoglycanase. Additionally, the expression of TIMP mRNA is steroid related and may be hormonally regulated. It is proposed that TIMP produced in the granulosa cell compartment in conjunction with alpha 2-macroglobulin from the serum may act to control the site and extent of ovarian connective tissue remodeling.\r"

The transduction mechanisms involved in muscarinic receptor activation are now better understood. Receptor-linked phosphoinositide hydrolysis leads to release of calcium ions from intracellular stores, resulting in contraction of airway smooth muscle. At least five subtypes of muscarinic receptor have now been cloned, although only three subtypes can be distinguished pharmacologically. M1 receptors are facilitatory to neurotransmission in airway parasympathetic ganglion cells and have also been identified in airway submucosal glands and on the alveolar walls of human lung. M2 receptors are located on postganglionic nerves and function as powerful feedback inhibitory receptors (autoreceptors) that are likely to be involved in modulation of reflex bronchoconstriction. These receptors may be dysfunctional in asthmatic airways. M3 receptors are present on airway smooth muscle and submucosal glands and mediate the classical muscarinic effects in airways. Molecular biology techniques should now allow further study of the factors that regulate transcription and expression of muscarinic receptors in airways.\r"

Both techniques are highly sensitive to differences in epithelial permeability. PD (mV) was assayed with a KCl-saturated agar bridge technique in the lower trachea of Fischer 344 rats depleted of SP by neonatal capsaicin treatment. Capsaicin treatment is known to ablate a subpopulation of primary afferent fibers containing SP. Resorptive clearance (clearance in 1 h) was measured with 99mTc-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid administered as a 100-microliters (100 microCi) bolus. Depletion of SP by neonatal treatment with capsaicin resulted in a highly significant increase in resorptive clearance (P less than 0.001). There was also a significant difference in PD in the lower trachea, the values being less negative for the capsaicin-treated rats (P less than 0.005). The increase in resorptive clearance may reflect the leakiness of the epithelial membrane, as also suggested by the decrease in PD. Aside from its known involvement as a neurotransmitter in neurogenic inflammation, SP may, under normal physiological conditions, have an additional role in the maintenance of epithelial barrier function.\r"

We investigated the influence of maximal exercise on glucoregulation in non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects (NIDDM). Seven NIDDM and seven healthy control males bicycled 7 min at 60% of their maximal O2 consumption (VO2max), 3 min at 100% VO2max, and 2 min at 110% VO2max. In both groups, glucose production (Ra) increased more with exercise than did glucose uptake (Rd) and, accordingly, plasma glucose increased. However, in NIDDM subjects the increase in Ra was hastened and Rd inhibited compared with controls, so the increase in glucose occurred earlier and was greater [147 +/- 21 to 169 +/- 19 (30 min postexercise) vs. 90 +/- 4 to 100 +/- 5 (SE) mg/dl (10 min postexercise), P less than 0.05]. Glucose levels remained elevated for greater than 60 min postexercise in both groups. Glucose clearance increased during exercise but decreased postexercise to or below (NIDDM, P less than 0.05) basal levels, despite increased insulin levels (P less than 0.05). Plasma epinephrine and glucagon responses to exercise were higher in NIDDM than in control subjects (P less than 0.05). By use of the insulin clamp technique at 40 microU.m-2.min-1 of insulin with plasma glucose maintained at basal levels, glucose disposal in NIDDM subjects, but not in controls, was enhanced 24 h after exercise. It is concluded that, because of exaggerated counter-regulatory hormonal responses, maximal dynamic exercise results in a 60-min period of postexercise hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in NIDDM. However, this event is followed by a period of increased insulin effect on Rd that is present 24 h after exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Physiol. 60: 123-132, 1986) may reflect inhomogeneous parallel time constants or the inherent viscoelastic properties of the respiratory tissues. However, studies on the lung alone or chest wall alone indicate that their impedance features are also dependent on the tidal volumes (VT) of the forced oscillations. The goals of this study were 1) to identify how total Zrs at lower frequencies measured with random noise (RN) compared with that measure with larger VT, 2) to identify how Zrs measured with RN is affected by bronchoconstriction, and 3) to identify the impact of using linear models for analyzing such data. We measured Zrs in six healthy dogs by use of a RN technique from 0.125 to 4 Hz or with a ventilator from 0.125 to 0.75 Hz with VT from 50 to 250 ml. Then methacholine was administered and the RN was repeated. Two linear models were fit to each separate set of data. Both models assume uniform airways leading to viscoelastic tissues. For healthy dogs, the respiratory resistance (Rrs) decreased with frequency, with most of the decrease occurring from 0.125 to 0.375 Hz. Significant VT dependence of Rrs was seen only at these lower frequencies, with Rrs higher as VT decreased. The respiratory compliance (Crs) was dependent on VT in a similar fashion at all frequencies, with Crs decreasing as VT decreased. Both linear models fit the data well at all VT, but the viscoelastic parameters of each model were very sensitive to VT. After methacholine, the minimum Rrs increased as did the total drop with frequency. Nevertheless the same models fit the data well, and both the airways and tissue parameters were altered after methacholine. We conclude that inferences based only on low-frequency Zrs data are problematic because of the effects of VT on such data (and subsequent linear modeling of it) and the apparent inability of such data to differentiate parallel inhomogeneities from normal viscoelastic properties of the respiratory tissues.\r"

These categories are related to the known transmission routes of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

In 1986, AIDS was the eighth leading cause of premature death in this country, and if current trends continue, it will become the second by 1992. Although HIV infection rates in \"risk group\" members have been extensively studied, much less is known about infection rates in persons outside these groups. A variety of surveys are under way to monitor the spread of HIV. The epidemiologic puzzle of Kaposi's sarcoma is considered, as well as reasons for the decrease in it as a proportion of all AIDS cases.\r"

There is no evidence for transmission by close interpersonal nonsexual contact or insect vectors. Health care workers are at risk for HIV transmission through accidental parenteral inoculation or extensive exposure to blood on nonintact skin or mucous membranes. Fortunately, population studies indicate that this risk is low and may be further reduced by adherence to simple infection control guidelines. The accumulated information on low rates of occupational transmission of HIV makes unwarranted the treatment of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or HIV infection as if they were highly contagious in the health care setting.\r"

  ".W": "The general physical characteristics and replication of retroviruses are considered, along with assays for viral products. The specific agent for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is characterized as a lentivirus causing persistent, lifelong infection. While human immunodeficiency virus retroviruses share many of the same properties as other replication-competent viruses, genetic variability occurs among HIV isolates, and this variability may have a considerable effect on the virus' virulence, cell type specificity, viral susceptibility to antiviral compounds, clinical presentation, and disease progression. The most notable difference between HIV replication and other retroviruses is the intricate control of HIV gene expression by viral and cellular factors. Possible mechanisms by which HIV kills infected cells include the formulation of multinucleate syncytia; cytopathic components within the virions themselves; and interaction between viral envelope proteins and the CD4 molecule on the cell surface. Agents shown to inhibit viral replication at the level of the reverse transcriptase are phosphonoformate, sulfated polysaccharides, rifabutin, and nucleoside analogs, as well as purine and pyrimidine analogs. To date, only one nucleoside analog, zidovudine, has demonstrated clear clinical benefit and anti-HIV activity.\r"

Features of the HIV life cycle may explain aspects of the pathogenesis of HIV-induced disease. The tropism of HIV for CD4+ cells of both lymphocytic and monocytic origin is of considerable importance in bringing about immune deficiency. The variability of the HIV envelope limits the ability of host-immune response to control the infection effectively. Finally, the ability of HIV to persist is latently integrated DNA in infected cells that can be reactivated by cellular signals responsible for the control of normal immune cell activation links HIV replication to normal host cell functions. This can help explain the chronic but progressive nature of the infection.\r"

Because levels of both antigen and antibody vary throughout disease development, knowledge of how and why such changes occur will lend insight into viral pathogenic mechanisms and will facilitate the development of differential diagnostic tests for classifying AIDS patients and their disease states. This task becomes very complex when dealing with HIV viruses because they possess an unprecedented number of regulatory genes for members of the retrovirus family.\r"

This system includes antigen-presenting Langerhans cells, dermal and epidermal T lymphocytes, cytokine-producing keratinocytes, and draining peripheral lymph nodes. In patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), this surveillance system appears to be compromised, as evidenced by a reduction in the epidermal Langerhans cell population. Because human epidermal Langerhans cell express surface-bound CD4 antigens, HLA-DR antigens, and Fc-IgG receptors, all of which are involved in HIV-1 binding to, or entry into, the target cell, the reduction in Langerhans cells in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) may be a direct consequence of HIV-1 infection and subsequent injury to Langerhans cells. Detailed ultrastructural studies have confirmed moderate to severe morphologic damage in some Langerhans cells of such patients and the presence of HIV-1-like particles on Langerhans cell surface membranes and in the extracellular spaces. The biologic consequences of Langerhans cell infection by HIV-1 could be either impaired antigen presentation function of viable Langerhans cells or possible transmission of the retrovirus to the T-cell compartment in skin or lymph nodes, with subsequent depletion of CD4+ T cells via widespread syncytia formation between HIV-1-infected and noninfected cells. The facts that herpes simplex virus, specific cytokines, and ultraviolet B radiation can activate signals for HIV-1 expression and that epidermal cells can elaborate large amounts of cytokines, particularly with enhanced ultraviolet B exposure, may have important clinical implications for HIV-1-infected patients.\r"

In the mid-twentieth century, more aggressive forms of Kaposi's sarcoma were found to be an endemic disease especially common among young black men in central Africa. Kaposi's sarcoma also occurs in iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients, such as kidney transplant recipients. In 1981, the sudden occurrence of an unusual, disseminated form of Kaposi's sarcoma in homosexual men in New York and California heralded the epidemic now known as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Ninety-five percent of all AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS) has been in homosexual men; however, the incidence of AIDS-KS has diminished from greater than 40% of men with AIDS since 1981 to less than 20% in 1989. The remaining 5% of AIDS-KS has been seen in all other populations at risk for AIDS. The reasons for the remarkable persistent increased prevalence of AIDS-KS among homosexual men remains obscure. Clinically, AIDS-KS is a highly varied neoplastic disease characterized by multifocal mucocutaneous lesions often with lymphatic and visceral involvement. The etiology of Kaposi's sarcoma remains unknown although various hypotheses have been suggested, including endothelial-tumor growth factors, oncogenic expression, genetic predisposition, and environmental cofactors. An as-yet unidentified viruslike agent has been proposed as a possible direct cause of this neoplasm. Different treatment modalities for Kaposi's sarcoma have been employed with varying success, these include localized radiation therapy, cryotherapy, electrocauterization, surgical excision, and a variety of systemic chemotherapeutic regimens, as well as alpha-interferon. Although all available treatments help control the lesions, none lengthens survival.\r"

This and other findings suggest that one or more cofactors associated with the homosexual lifestyle, rather than a special viral strain, probably influence the development of KS in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Possible reasons for the decline include changes in homosexual behaviors, leading to the practice of safer sexual techniques, and a decrease in use of nitrite inhalants. Identification of the KS-AIDS cofactor(s) could be invaluable to developing prevention and treatment strategies.\r"

One hundred thirty-nine patients (106 men) were randomly allocated according to a prearranged treatment schedule to either dose and were treated single-blind (endoscopist). One hundred twenty-six patients (63 given 150 mg ranitidine and 63 given 300 mg) completed the trial. In the per-protocol analysis, 55 patients given full doses (81%) and 47 given half doses (70%) of ranitidine had healed ulcers at 4 weeks. Sixty full-dose and 55 half-dose patients (95% and 87%, respectively), had healed ulcers at 8 weeks. The difference was not significant using the chi 2 test (two-tailed), but the 95% confidence limits were in favor of the 300-mg dose. This study had a 75% power to detect a 25% difference in healing rates between the two groups.\r"

  ".U": "90300132\r", 
  ".W": "Aspirin is commonly accepted as a risk factor for gastric ulcer; however, there is little published evidence linking aspirin consumption to duodenal ulcer. The effect of 1 g of aspirin per day on site-specific ulcer hospitalizations was examined using data from a 3-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 4,524 subjects (Aspirin Myocardial Infarction Study). There were 23 duodenal ulcer and 14 gastric ulcer hospitalizations during the follow-up period. All but two were verified by endoscopy, radiogram, or biopsy/surgery. For males, a Cox-model survival analysis showed that the age- and smoking-adjusted relative risk for duodenal ulcer hospitalization was 10.7 times higher for the aspirin group than for the placebo group (95% confidence interval, 2.5 to 45.5; p less than 0.0001). The adjusted relative risk for gastric ulcer was 9.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 71.4; p = 0.04). Due to the small number of females in the study, the relationship between site-specific ulcer and aspirin consumption for females was not analyzed. However, for males and females combined, the age-, smoking-, and sex-adjusted relative risk for peptic ulcer hospitalization was 7.7 (95% confidence interval, 2.7 to 21.7; p less than 0.0001). We conclude that chronic aspirin use is a risk factor for hospitalization for both duodenal and gastric ulcer in males, and for peptic ulcer in males and females.\r"

We conducted a retrospective review of patients with ultrasonographic diagnosis of biliary tract sludge during the 6-year period from 1979 to 1985. Of the 87 patients with gallbladder sludge alone, 11 (13%) had definite clinical findings and evolving laboratory abnormalities consistent with acute biliary tract disease. Four of these 11 patients proved to have gallstones at the time of surgery, while three had sludge alone as the apparent cause of their biliary tract symptoms. The clinical illness in four remaining patients resolved with medical therapy. We conclude that gallbladder sludge, as defined by ultrasound, may be associated with acute biliary tract disease.\r"

  ".W": "Histologic activity of chronic cholestasis and lymphocytic piecemeal necrosis, a characteristic finding of chronic active hepatitis, was examined semiquantitatively in 157 liver biopsy specimens from 122 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Although both of these lesions were usually admixed variably in a single liver specimen, semiquantitative assessment made it possible to classify liver biopsy specimens into four groups: group A, no or minimum cholestatic or hepatitic changes (58 specimens); group B, predominantly cholestatic changes (37 specimens); and group C, predominantly hepatitic changes (54 specimens). Only eight specimens fell into group D, prominent cholestatic as well as hepatitic changes. Serial liver biopsies of specimens within groups B and C showed a persistence of group B- and C-type pathologies, while liver biopsies of group A specimens frequently changed to group B or C. Immunohistochemical studies illustrated that lymphocytic piecemeal necrosis mainly consisted of activated T lymphocytes as seen in chronic active hepatitis. Our data suggest that either of two hepatic parenchymal lesions predominates and persists in each liver biopsy specimen. A high cholestatic score appeared to relate to poor prognoses of the patients and also to the degree of cirrhotic transformation. This grouping system may be valuable in the clinicopathologic assessment of PBC, when it is combined with ordinary staging.\r"

Urinalysis revealed increased heparan sulfate. At necropsy, aortic and mitral valves revealed nodular thickening and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive, metachromatic granules in renal proximal tubules. The brain weighed 400 g and demonstrated cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with a retrocerebellar meningeal cyst. Cortical neurons contained periodic acid-Schiff-positive and cresyl violet-reactive granules. White matter demonstrated brown metachromasia and intense fibrillary gliosis. Conjunctival fibroblasts contained amorphous vacuoles with dense osmiophilic nucleoid cores. Pleomorphic extracellular, intraneural and intraglial inclusions were noted in the brain. Activities of arylsulfatase A, B and C were diminished markedly in autopsied tissue from brain, liver, and kidney (0, 0 and less than 10% of control activities, respectively). Partial deficiencies of iduronate sulfatase and heparan sulfatase were noted in different tissues. Variable decreased enzyme activities were expressed in leukocytes: arylsulfatase A, less than 33%; B, 40%; and C, 90%; heparan sulfatase, 2%; and iduronate sulfatase was not detectable. Near normal activities were found in cultured fibroblasts.\r"

The program utilized gender-matched normal limits developed from 35 LL patients at CSMC. The multicenter results as compared to those of 168 patients from CSMC were not significantly different with respect to the overall sensitivities (94% versus 95%) and specificities (44% versus 56%) for identification of CAD and normalcy rates which were determined in LL patients (82% for both) and with respect to identification of individual diseased arteries. The results indicate that our method for quantifying tomographic 201TI stress scintigrams utilizing standard normal limits can be applied at other institutions by different operators, using a variety of cameras and computers, with similar accuracy to that currently obtained at our institution.\r"

T4 values fell significantly by seven days of therapy, and the decreased values were sustained. FT3 and FT4I also showed corresponding decreases in value. All subjects showed clinical improvement by both subjective and objective criteria. During therapy, escape from the effect of iopanoic acid was not encountered. However, after stopping the drug for 2-4 wk, the patients' iodine-131 uptake become as high as the pretherapy level, enabling them to undergo radioiodine treatment for thyrotoxicosis. The treatment strategy can be aimed at achieving quick euthyroidism and in planning radioiodine treatment as early as possible in high risk patients. This treatment may also be useful in preoperative control of thyrotoxicosis.\r"

The renal uptake method of Gates correlated poorly to the standards at all GFR levels even when corrected for body surface area or blood volume. The Russell two point and Jackson urinary GFR's can be used as complementary techniques and are recommended as primary methods of scintigraphic GFR determination.\r"

  ".W": "Two complementary DNAs (cDNAs) previously isolated, one by functional screening and the other by immunological screening of a Dictyostelium discoideum expression library, encode two proteins, Gip17 and Guk7.2, sharing 71% homology. In the present study, we found that the expression of their messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is developmentally regulated, with a sharp decrease during the first hours of differentiation. The Gip17 protein was purified to homogeneity from D. discoideum amoebas and from recombinant Escherichia coli and was conclusively identified as a nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase. NDP kinases play a major role in synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates and, in many systems, are found associated with guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins. We found the Gip17 protein to be 77% homologous to the human Nm23 protein and 75% homologous to the Drosophila melanogaster Awd protein. The levels of murine and human nm23 mRNA and Nm23 protein are significantly reduced in tumor cells of high metastatic potential, suggesting that Nm23 is involved in suppression of mammalian tumor metastasis, and mutants of the awd gene exhibit widespread development abnormalities, suggesting that Awd is involved in D. melanogaster development. The high percentage of homology of the Gip17 and Guk7.2 proteins with the Nm23 and Awd proteins indicates that Nm23 and Awd also have nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity. Possible modulations in the activity of this metabolic enzyme could be related to the altered metabolism of tumor cells and the control of metastatic potential. Our results point to an unexpected role of NDP kinase in development, growth control, and oncogenic transformation.\r"

Patients received two 5-day cycles of 100,000 Cetus U/kg (600,000 IU/kg) of rIL-2 infused intravenously over 15 minutes every 8 hours; each treatment cycle was separated by 1 week. No objective responses were seen. The toxicity of rIL-2 given alone at these high doses was similar to that noted with high-dose rIL-2-LAK cell therapy. The lack of responses seen in this trial also differed from the 21% response rate observed by the NCI Surgery Branch, using rIL-2 alone at an identical schedule and dose in 56 patients with renal cell carcinoma. Only minor differences in such recognized prognostic variables as performance status, tumor burden, and rIL-2 dose intensity were noted between this study and other trials reported by the NCI Surgery Branch and by the IL-2-LAK Working Group. Our analysis indicates that, because of the smaller number of patients in our trial, not enough subjects were included with the ideal characteristics to attain the 21% response rate seen in the NCI study. However, the precise nature of these characteristics remains unclear.\r"

Over the past two decades important influences on the cardiovascular system have been either rediscovered or observed for the first time. The combined use of tobacco cigarettes and alcohol appears to increase the risk of many of these clinical abnormalities. While many individuals addicted to ethanol have subclinical abnormalities of the heart, somewhat less than a majority develop symptomatic cardiac problems. These include heart failure and arrhythmias. In addition to supraventricular arrhythmias that often normalize spontaneously, there is an increased incidence of sudden death that peaks at about 50 years of age in the alcoholic population. A significant degree of blood pressure elevation occurs in individuals who abuse alcohol. This appears to be transient and is normalized in most individuals during abstinence. The increased incidence of hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic stroke in middle age also appears to decline when alcohol abuse is interrupted. A preventive effect of mild to moderate drinking on coronary artery disease is, at present, equivocal, largely due to the question of appropriate controls.\r"

  ".W": "The present study compared directly the ability of precipitating and nonprecipitating antibodies to form and sustain glomerular immune deposits. The antigen phenylated gelatin (DNP-GL) was injected i.v. into rats. DNP-GL is cleared from the circulation rapidly and becomes localized in glomeruli. Two hours later, rats received either precipitating or nonprecipitating mouse monoclonal anti-DNP antibodies. These antibodies were comparable with respect to size, affinity, number of antigen combining sites and isoelectric point. However, in vitro, nonprecipitating antibodies demonstrated a faster dissociation rate from antigen than precipitating antibodies. Control rats received DNP-GL alone or antibody alone. Antibody deposition in glomeruli was quantitated by Computerized Image Analysis (CIA) of immunoperoxidase stained tissue sections and by glomerular radioactive counts in experiments using 125I labelled antibodies. We demonstrated that glomerular uptake of anti-DNP antibody was similar two hours after injection of precipitating and nonprecipitating antibodies. However, six or more hours after injection, significantly less antibody was present in the glomeruli of rats injected with nonprecipitating antibodies. These differences could not be explained by a greater rate of antigen removal from kidney in rats injected with nonprecipitating antibodies. To assess whether nonprecipitating antibodies modify the glomerular binding and retention of precipitating antibody, in a separate series of experiments rats were injected with equal amounts of precipitating and nonprecipitating antibodies. Both types of antibody bound to glomeruli. However, with time glomerular antibody levels paralleled those found in rats injected with nonprecipitating antibody alone. We conclude that the precipitating characteristics of antibodies do not affect their ability to deposit in kidney.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This mRNA was more abundantly expressed in the kidneys of 17-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats than those of age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats. The putative protein encoded by this cDNA is a homologue of cyclophilin, a cytosolic binding protein for cyclosporin A. This cyclophilin-like protein mRNA was expressed in all the tissues examined, including the adrenal, atrium, brain, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, and ventricle. Sodium depletion in rats increased the expression level of this mRNA not only in the kidney but also in the liver. The administration of cyclosporin A in rats increased the expression level of this mRNA in the kidneys and livers. By virtue of its possible involvement in sodium homeostasis and its homology to cyclophilin, this molecule might have significant implications in the mechanism of cyclosporine-induced renal insufficiency and hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Since recent studies indicate that cyclosporine (CsA) disrupts endothelial integrity and that injured endothelial cells release excess endothelin, we examined endothelin's role in acute cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. Following CsA (20 mg/kg i.v.), rabbit anti-porcine endothelin (aE) serum was continuously infused into a first order branch of the main renal artery in Munich-Wistar rats whereupon the hemodynamics of glomeruli not infused with aE as well as those infused with aE within the same kidney were simultaneously assessed by micropuncture techniques. In CsA treated kidneys, in glomeruli not infused with aE, single nephron GFR (SNGFR) and glomerular plasma flow rate (QA) fell profoundly (on average by 42 and 48%, respectively) below the baseline values in association with lower glomerular capillary pressure and elevated afferent arteriolar resistance. By contrast, in glomeruli infused with aE within the same CsA treated kidneys, this vasoconstrictive pattern was markedly attenuated: SNGFR was, on average, only 19% lower than baseline and values for QA as well as other parameters determining glomerular filtration were at or near the levels observed before administration of CsA. In another group of rats (N = 6) an identical dose of CsA was given to measure the circulating level of endothelin. In these CsA treated rats, endothelin level (measured by radioimmunoassay) was elevated at 41.7 +/- 14.7 pg/ml, contrasting the value of less than 2 pg/ml uniformly observed in identically instrumented normal rats not given CsA (N = 5). Thus, cyclosporine is a potential inducer for endothelin release and endothelin appears to have a pivotal role in pathophysiology of cyclosporine-induced acute renal vasoconstriction and glomerular dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of high concentrations of glucose on PTH secretion from cultured bovine parathyroid cells. Increasing medium concentration of glucose caused suppression of PTH secretion. A significant suppression of PTH secretion was found within 48 hours of incubation with as little as 15 mM glucose. The addition of choline chloride to the medium did not suppress PTH secretion, although the osmolality was the same as that of the medium containing 50 mM glucose. When cells previously exposed to 50 mM glucose were reincubated in the medium containing 5 mM glucose for another 48 hours, a complete recovery of PTH secretion was observed. In the cells exposed to 50 mM glucose, the magnitude of the response of PTH secretion to 10(-6) M isoproterenol was blunted. Acid-urea gel electrophoresis revealed that the pattern of intact PTH and fragments secreted from cells exposed to high concentration of glucose was similar to that from control cells. Removal of insulin from the medium resulted in a suppression of PTH secretion similar to changes observed with high concentrations of glucose. The suppressive effects of high concentrations of glucose and lack of insulin were additive. However, we cannot exclude from the present studies whether the suppressive effects of the lack of insulin on PTH secretion was secondary to the fact that insulin may be required for the maintenance of parathyroid cells. The present studies demonstrate that glucose directly modulates PTH secretion in primary parathyroid cell culture.\r"

We therefore randomly assigned 1214 patients who had recovered from acute myocardial infarction (mean interval from the onset of symptoms to randomization, 27 days) to treatment with warfarin (607 patients) or placebo (607 patients) for an average of 37 months (range, 24 to 63). RESULTS. At the end of the treatment period, there had been 123 deaths in the placebo group and 94 in the warfarin group--a reduction in risk of 24 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4 to 44 percent; P = 0.027). A total of 124 patients in the placebo group had reinfarctions, as compared with 82 in the warfarin group--a reduction of 34 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 54 percent; P = 0.0007). Furthermore, we observed a reduction of 55 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 30 to 77 percent) in the number of total cerebrovascular accidents in the warfarin group as compared with the placebo group (44 vs. 20; P = 0.0015). Serious bleeding was noted in 0.6 percent of the warfarin-treated patients per year. CONCLUSIONS. Long-term therapy with warfarin has an important beneficial effect after myocardial infarction and can be recommended in the treatment of patients who survive the acute phase.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Indirect-immunofluorescence studies of skin and cultured dermal fibroblasts from patients with the Marfan syndrome demonstrate apparent deficiency of one element of connective tissue--the microfibrillar-fiber system--in assays using specific antibodies against fibrillin, a major microfibrillar protein. This study was designed to test whether these immunostaining abnormalities are consistent and diagnostic features of the disease. METHODS. We studied patients with either the Marfan syndrome or various other inherited connective-tissue disorders and normal subjects according to a single-blind protocol in which coded samples of skin, fibroblast cultures, or both were analyzed without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis and classified as \"Marfan\" or \"non-Marfan\" before the sample codes were broken. RESULTS. Of the 27 patients with the Marfan syndrome, 24 were correctly identified by the decreased content of microfibrillar fibers in their skin, cultured fibroblasts, or both; in contrast, 19 of 25 patients with other heritable disorders of connective tissue and all 13 normal subjects were correctly classified as \"non-Marfan\" by these assays (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. These results document consistent, relatively specific abnormalities of microfibrillar fibers in the Marfan syndrome. The biomechanical incompetence of these structural elements, due to quantitative or qualitative abnormalities, may account for the pleiotropic clinical manifestations of the disease. Therefore, various defects in the expression, structure, assembly, or degradation of the constituent structural glycoprotein (or glycoproteins) of microfibrils may be implicated in the causation of the Marfan syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Measles kills about 2 million children annually, and there is no specific therapy for the disease. It has been suggested that vitamin A may be of benefit in the treatment of measles. METHODS. We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial involving 189 children who were hospitalized at a regional center in South Africa because of measles complicated by pneumonia, diarrhea, or croup. The children (median age, 10 months) were assigned to receive either vitamin A (total dose, 400,000 IU of retinyl palmitate, given orally; n = 92) or placebo (n = 97), beginning within five days of the onset of the rash. At base line, the characteristics of the two groups were similar. RESULTS. Although clinically apparent vitamin A deficiency is rare in this population, the children's serum retinol levels were markedly depressed (mean [+/- SEM], 0.405 +/- 0.021 mumols per liter [11.6 +/- 0.6 micrograms per deciliter]), and 92 percent of them had hyporetinemia (serum retinol level less than 0.7 mumols per liter [20 micrograms per deciliter]). Serum concentrations of retinol-binding protein (mean, 30.1 +/- 2.0 mg per liter) and albumin (mean, 33.4 +/- 0.5 g per liter) were also low. As compared with the placebo group, the children who received vitamin A recovered more rapidly from pneumonia (mean, 6.3 vs. 12.4 days, respectively; P less than 0.001) and diarrhea (mean, 5.6 vs. 8.5 days; P less than 0.001), had less croup (13 vs. 27 cases; P = 0.03), and spent fewer days in the hospital (mean, 10.6 vs. 14.8 days; P = 0.01). Of the 12 children who died, 10 were among those given placebo (P = 0.05). For the group treated with vitamin A, the risk of death or a major complication during the hospital stay was half that of the control group (relative risk, 0.51; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.74). CONCLUSIONS. Treatment with vitamin A reduces morbidity and mortality in measles, and all children with severe measles should be given vitamin A supplements, whether or not they are thought to have a nutritional deficiency.\r"

Published reports of 20 trepanations in 19 skulls are reviewed. All were believed to have been performed ante mortem. Most were from the pre-Columbian era. Eleven were from Canada (8 from British Columbia) and 8 from the United States. The location of skull perforation was parietal in 9 cases and less often frontal (3) or occipital (3). The average skull opening was oval or oblong, with a diameter of 3.0 cm. The method of trepanation was probably gradual scraping in most cases. Skull fractures were not present in any case. About 90% of the trepanations showed evidence of healing, indicating survival. The authors discuss the evidence for skull trepanation in the United States and Canada, and compare these findings to the better studied South and Central American material.\r"

Subtotal excision of the tumor improves the pain and may convert a carbamazepine-resistant neuralgia into a responsive one. Total excision is often followed by a cure. Faced with such a case, the tumor should always be excised first, as this usually cures the neuralgia. Surgical treatment of the neuralgia in the presence of the tumor may be followed by disastrous results. An alternative hypothesis to the pathogenesis of the contralateral neuralgia is presented.\r"

  ".W": "Three patients with a recently described tumor of neuronal origin, intraventricular neurocytoma, are presented. These tumors occur as intraventricular lesions in young patients, and the prognosis after surgical treatment is favorable. The initial pathological diagnosis of intraventricular neurocytoma may be difficult because of the striking resemblance of these tumors to oligodendroglioma and, to a lesser extent, ependymoma on light microscopic examination. Despite the use of wide-ranging panels of monoclonal antibodies, previous authors have not found any characteristic immunohistochemical staining patterns, but in our three patients, the use of synaptophysin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and Leu-7 demonstrated staining patterns that may be useful in the diagnosis of this tumor. The monoclonal antibody Ki-67 was used to stain one tumor and showed a low cell proliferation rate. We have reviewed the clinical, radiological, and pathological features of these 3 patients and 17 previously described patients in an attempt to determine the important diagnostic features of intraventricular neurocytoma. Intraventricular neurocytoma should be considered in any young patient with symptoms of raised intracranial pressure and radiological evidence of an intraventricular lesion. Pathological diagnosis requires the use of electron microscopy to show features of neuronal differentiation; however, immunohistochemical demonstration of a neuronal phenotype is also a useful adjunct to diagnosis. Failure to use specialized techniques for pathological diagnosis will lead to misdiagnosis of these lesions as oligodendrogliomas, as was the initial diagnosis in 2 of our patients before review.\r"

Certain stigmata found in these patients and their families are among those commonly seen in Marfan's disease. The concept, if valid, has important implications affecting therapeutic choices and may offer insights into unexplained failures. The finding of significant family involvement strengthens the possibility of a heritable substratum for this category of low back disease.\r"

  ".W": "Excitotoxin-induced neural tissue damage is mediated through specific receptors. We studied the in vivo effect of two selective N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists on the compressed spinal cord segments of rats harboring a thoracolumbar epidural tumor. The effect of a single intramuscular treatment with either MK-801 (3 mg/kg) or ketamine (110 mg/kg) given at the onset of paraplegia was evaluated 30 hours later. In saline-treated control animals, significant increases in water content, prostaglandin E2, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha were evident. Treatment with either agent resulted in a normal water content in the compressed segments but had no effect on prostaglandin synthesis. Evaluation of the effect of treatment on the course of the disease required dose reduction by 45% for ketamine and by 30% for MK-801, to avoid the excessive sedative effect. Treatment was started at the first appearance of neurological dysfunction (Grade 1) and continued to paraplegia (Grade 5). The mean time interval between Grades 1 and 5 was 2.1 +/- 0.3 days in saline-treated control animals, and it was not significantly altered by either ketamine or MK-801. Our study indicates that in the end stage of epidural compression, when ischemia is present, excitotoxins probably participate in the evolution of a cytotoxic edema. It is suggested that treatment initiated at the onset of paraplegia may still reduce the cytotoxic edema, but its potential clinical value requires further investigations.\r"

The effect of these treatments on vascular permeability of the normal and compressed spinal cord was quantitated by the Evans blue dye technique. Tumor-free and tumor-bearing rats were assigned randomly for treatment as follows: 0.5 ml of saline or three doses at 12-hour intervals of either dexamethasone (5 mg/kg), methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg), indomethacin (5 mg/kg every 24 hours), or a single dose of either ketamine (110 mg/kg) or MK-801 (3 mg/kg). Treatment was given at the onset of paraplegia, and the animals were killed after 30 hours. In tumor-bearing rats in the early symptomatic stage, extravasation of Evans blue dye was 4.8 times greater than that of the normal cord (P less than 0.001) and at the onset of paraplegia it was 9.9 times greater (P less than 0.0006). Glucocorticoids and indomethacin reduced dye extravasation in paraplegic animals (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.003, respectively), but the decreased permeability induced by ketamine and MK-801 did not reach the level of significance. In tumor-free control animals permeability was not changed by administration of either glucocorticoids or indomethacin but was significantly reduced by ketamine or MK-801 (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Type-specific antibodies, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and complement are integral to immunity against group B Streptococcus, and experimental data are presented to support the importance of these components. The newborn infant is handicapped by temporary deficiencies in host defenses, and approaches for restoring immunocompetence, such as immunization of the mother or passive administration of intravenous immunoglobulins or other immune factors, are presented for consideration.

  ".W": "The similarity in the susceptibility to bacterial infections of newborns and older patients with complement deficiencies, neutropenia, or neutrophil function defects has suggested that neutrophils and/or complement might also be defective in newborns. Although no individual element of the phagocytic host defense system is severely deficient, several partial deficiencies have been identified. These involve important amplification pathways of complement and neutrophil activation and may combine to cause significant decreases in phagocyte activity at sites of infection. Because of decreased specific antibody, initial activation of the classical complement pathway is decreased. Low levels of C3 and factor B decrease amplification by the alternative pathway and result in marked decreases in opsonization and generation of chemotactic activity from C5. There are also quantitative and qualitative neutrophil defects. The recent observations that newborns' neutrophils are relatively deficient in membrane expression of their major adherence protein/C3bi receptor help explain the decreased mobility and phagocytic activity of these cells. Thus, several partial deficiencies combine to cause severe impairments in delivery of neutrophils to sites of infection and contribute to the increased susceptibility of the newborn to infection.\r"

Alternatively, inhibitors of specific glycoproteins of virus-cell binding might be used to prevent the productive infection of intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, since many enteric viruses require proteolytic enzymes for protein cleavage, protease inhibitors may prove effective for inhibition of intestinal viral replication. At this time, these methods have proven useful for the inhibition of rotavirus infection in experimental animals. The successful application of these and other methods for the prevention of enteric infections in humans might substantially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with enteric diseases in high-risk neonates.\r"

  ".W": "Fibronectin is a large-molecular-weight glycoprotein present on most cell surfaces, in extracellular fluids, and in plasma. Both cell-associated and soluble fibronectin are thought to have important roles in the inflammatory response and host defense and may contribute to the maintenance of microvascular integrity during septic episodes. Newborn infants have levels of fibronectin in plasma that are one-third to one-half those found in the healthy adult. In addition, neonates with respiratory distress syndrome, perinatal asphyxia, bacterial sepsis, intrauterine growth retardation, or postnatal malnutrition have a further depression in their plasma levels of fibronectin. The low plasma concentration of fibronectin in newborn infants may contribute to the hypofunction of the neonatal reticuloendothelial system and predispose to the development of sepsis. Rates of synthesis of plasma fibronectin are diminished in the neonate, and an inverse correlation between fibronectin half-life and gestational age exists. The role of fibronectin in treatment or prophylaxis of neonatal sepsis remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as prophylaxis for late sepsis was evaluated in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial involving 240 infants of very low birth weight (less than 1,300 g). Each infant received a total of five doses of either IVIG (1 g/d) or an albumin placebo. The first four doses were administered between days 1 and 5 of life, and the last dose was administered on day 15 or shortly thereafter. Preliminary analysis of data available for 126 patients showed that in the first 30 days, sepsis developed in nine of 61 patients given IVIG and in 16 of 65 given placebo (one-tailed P = .065). At 70 days, the number who developed sepsis was similar in the two groups: 20 for those who received IVIG vs. 23 for those who received placebo. When patients with coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections were deleted from the totals, the results were essentially the same, i.e., three of 61 who received IVIG vs. nine of 65 who received placebo (one-tailed P = .041), developed sepsis during the first 30 days and 12 of 61 vs. 13 of 65, respectively, had developed sepsis at 70 days. In the IVIG group, the median peak level of serum IgG at day 7 was 1,700 mg/dL and the IgG levels were significantly greater than those in the placebo group for days 7-42. These data suggest that infusions of IVIG at the doses and dosing intervals used in this study may be effective in decreasing the incidence of late-onset sepsis during the first month of life in infants of very low birth weight.\r"

Humoral immunity was long thought to play only a small role in prevention, reduction of severity, or recovery from RSV infections of the lower respiratory tract. We recently performed a series of experiments in RSV-infected cotton rats, owl monkeys, and human infants to assess the role of humoral immunity in the prevention or recovery from RSV infections. This report summarizes studies utilizing intravenous IgG (IVIG) administered parenterally or topically (into the lower airway) for prophylaxis or treatment of RSV infections of the lower respiratory tract. The prophylactic administration (parenteral or topical) of IVIG to cotton rats or its therapeutic administration to RSV-infected cotton rats, owl monkeys, or humans significantly reduced RSV replication. The reductions in titers of virus correlated positively with titers of RSV-neutralizing antibody. Clinical trials are indicated to determine whether parenteral IVIG prophylaxis might prevent serious RSV infections in high-risk infants.\r"

  ".W": "Several lines of evidence suggest that passive immunization as adjunctive therapy for or prevention of group B streptococcal (GBS) sepsis in neonates will require the use of preparations of human intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) that are hyperimmune for protective antibodies to GBS. Results from both in vitro and in vivo experiments utilizing commercially available IVIG preparations suggest that the doses necessary for achieving levels of pathogen-specific antibody capable of promoting efficient opsonization and phagocytosis of GBS may be prohibitive. Several laboratories have reported that standard IVIG preparations contain only modest levels of antibodies to the four capsular polysaccharides of GBS (the protective moieties), are variable in their effect on in vitro opsonophagocytosis by dose and method of preparation, and are significantly less protective in animal models than is IVIG prepared from adults immunized with GBS polysaccharide vaccines. Further, when we gave a single infusion of standard IVIG at a dose of either 500 or 750 mg/kg to 10 premature neonates during the first week of life, opsonophagocytosis of type III GBS by their sera and adult neutrophils was observed only when high levels of specific antibody were achieved, levels only transiently achieved in nonimmune infants. Commercial preparation of human immune globulin hyperimmune for GBS will be required for optimal adjunctive therapy in patients with sepsis due to GBS and for the possible prevention of late-onset infant disease.\r"

Standard intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is made from large pools of plasma obtained from normal blood donors. However, lot-to-lot variation in titers of antibody to specific microbial pathogens may diminish therapeutic efficacy. Since group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an important neonatal pathogen, a preparation with high titers of activity against GBS was prepared and studied. Plasma was obtained from volunteers immunized with a polyvalent GBS vaccine and was processed by the Swiss Red Cross for intravenous infusion. This high-titered GBS intravenous immunoglobulin (GBS-IVIG) was shown to be superior both in vitro and in vivo to standard IVIG. GBS-IVIG provided protection when therapy was delayed for up to 24 hours after infection. Standard IVIG did not protect animals against all GBS strains. However, GBS-IVIG enhanced survival from infection with all strains tested, even when the challenge dose of GBS was increased by 2 log units. Specific hyperimmune globulins to pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae have also been studied. Immunization of adult volunteers as a means of obtaining hyperimmune globulin appears to be an effective method of producing high-titered pathogen-specific preparations of IVIG.\r"

  ".W": "Colony-stimulating factors, such as the granulocyte-macrophage and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSF and G-CSF), are glycoproteins with biologic specificity defined by their ability to support proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells of various lineages. Their physiologic activities include stimulation and proliferation of early stem cell precursors and functional activation of mature peripheral effector cells. Recently produced recombinant human (rh) GM-CSF and G-CSF have been demonstrated to regulate hematopoietic neutrophil progenitor colony growth; to stimulate the release of bone marrow neutrophil storage pools; and to prime mature effector functions, including chemotaxis, oxidative metabolism, phagocytosis, C3bi receptor expression, and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity in adults. We examined the effects of rh-GM-CSF on priming superoxide release and chemotaxis of neonatal (cord) polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and of rh-G-CSF and rh-GM-CSF on bone marrow neutrophil egress in the neonatal rat. A time-response evaluation of the effect of rh-GM-CSF revealed enhanced release of superoxide by PMNs. PMN chemotaxis also was enhanced by rh-GM-CSF, with a maximal response occurring earlier than enhanced superoxide release. Intraperitoneal administration of rh-G-CSF or rh-GM-CSF to 1-day-old rats resulted in significant increases in white blood cell counts and significant early neutrophilia. Bone marrow examination revealed that the neutrophilia was secondary to egress and mild depletion of the neutrophil storage pool but that the neutrophil storage pool later returned to normal. These preliminary studies suggest that rh-GM-CSF and rh-G-CSF prime neonatal effector function and induces significant PMN egress and neutrophilia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Many are thought to be mediated by the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM), a complex extracellular matrix that surrounds the photoreceptors and lies between them and the RPE. Histochemical, immunocytochemical, and lectin probes for several IPM constituents revealed that components of the IPM in the rat undergo a major shift in distribution or molecular conformation after the transition between light and dark. In the light, various IPM constituents concentrated in bands at the apical and basal regions of the outer segment zone; in the dark, they distributed much more uniformly throughout the zone. The change in IPM distribution was triggered by the light-dark transition; it was not a circadian event, and it was not driven by a systemic factor. The light-evoked change in IPM distribution may facilitate the transfer of substances between the photoreceptors and the RPE.\r"

Expression of this protein, designated TBP-1 (for Tat binding protein-1), was observed in a variety of cell lines, with expression being highest in human cells. TBP-1 was localized predominantly in the nucleus, which is consistent with the nuclear localization of Tat. In cotransfection experiments, expression of TBP-1 was able to specifically suppress Tat-mediated transactivation. The strategy described may be useful for direct identification and cloning of genes encoding proteins that associate with other proteins to modulate their activity in a positive or negative fashion.\r"

  ".W": "In Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-infected chickens, wounding leads to tumor formation with nearly 100% frequency in tissues that would otherwise remain tumor-free. Identifying molecular mediators of this phenomenon should yield important clues to the mechanisms involved in RSV tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemical staining showed that TGF-beta is present locally shortly after wounding, but not unwounded controls. In addition, subcutaneous administration of recombinant transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) could substitute completely for wounding in tumor induction. A treatment protocol of four doses of 800 nanograms of TGF-beta resulted in v-src-expressing tumors with 100% frequency; four doses of only 10 nanograms still led to tumor formation in 80% of the animals. This effect was specific, as other growth factors with suggested roles in wound healing did not elicit the same response. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) or TGF-alpha had no effect, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) yielded only occasional tumors after longer latency. TGF-beta release during the wound-healing response may thus be a critical event that creates a conducive environment for RSV tumorigenesis and may act as a cofactor for transformation in this system.\r"

Most of the immunoreactive cells observed were CD11b monocytes, and even these were only scattered in the connective tissue.

  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a naturally occurring mitogen which, in its recombinant form, is under intensive investigation for therapeutic use. Receptor activation by EGF induces up-regulation of synthesis of specific proteins as well as proliferation and differentiation of the corneal epithelium, keratocytes, and endothelium both in vivo and in vitro. With topical application of EGF, corneal wounds could possibly heal within hours, and the strength of the stromal scars is also increased; this may lead to the prospect of sutureless surgery. It may be possible to treat degenerative and dystrophic disorders of the cornea, especially of the endothelium, and to enhance the density of endothelial cells in donor corneas prior to transplantation. Combination therapy with EGF, fibroblast growth factor, and corticosteroids may be advantageous in producing a synergistic effect. It is possible that, with increased knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and the development of appropriate delivery systems, EGF could become an integral part of the next generation of ophthalmic pharmaceuticals.\r"

  ".U": "90302877\r", 
  ".W": "This study was undertaken to examine the antinociceptive roles of different subtypes of opiate receptors and their interactions at the level of the spinal cord. We recorded extracellularly the activity of the single wide dynamic range neurons evoked by noxious radiant heat (51 degrees C) in decerebrate, spinally transected cats. The separate intrathecal administration of DAGO selective mu-agonist, n = 28), morphine (less selective mu-agonist, n = 22), DPDPE (selective delta-agonist, n = 25), and DADL (less selective delta-agonist, n = 17) produced statistically significant suppression of noxiously evoked activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, intravenously administered naloxone (nonselective opiate antagonist) reversed the suppressive effects of all opiates studied. Intravenously administered ICI 174,864 (selective delta-antagonist) reversed the effects of DPDPE. These results, based on relative selectivity for opiate receptors, indicate that both mu- and delta-opiate receptors can modulate the input of nociceptive information in the spinal dorsal horn. To study interactions between mu- and delta-receptors at the level of the spinal cord, a combination of the above agonists was injected intrathecally--namely, an ineffective or slightly effective dose of DAGO (1 or 1.5 micrograms, respectively) that was combined with an ineffective dose of DPDPE (30 micrograms). The intrathecal combination of DAGO and DPDPE produced significant synergistic suppressive effects of noxiously evoked activity. These findings, again based on relative selectivity, suggest that drug combinations that include both selective mu- and delta-agonists may be a useful method of lowering the total amount of any one drug, thus decreasing the likelihood of side effects, while at the same time producing significant analgesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) and dopamine infusion (4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) on superior mesenteric artery blood flow (SMABF), the mesenteric arteriovenous oxygen difference (AVDO2), and the mesenteric venous lactate concentration were studied in nine patients before abdominal aortic reconstruction. Thoracic epidural anesthesia reduced SMABF, as measured by electromagnetic flowmetry, to 77% +/- 8% (mean +/- SEM) of control (P less than 0.05), and mean arterial pressure to 46% +/- 4% of control (P less than 0.01). The mesenteric AVDO2 increased from 27 +/- 3 to 39 +/- 6 mL/L (P less than 0.05) and superior mesenteric venous lactate from 1.03 +/- 0.11 to 1.60 +/- 0.38 mmol/kg (P less than 0.05); systemic AVDO2 and lactate did not change. Dopamine had no significant effect on SMABF and mean arterial pressure before TEA. However, dopamine increased SMABF during TEA (from 77% +/- 8% to 137% +/- 21% of control; P less than 0.01), returned mesenteric AVDO2 to 27 +/- 3 mL/L (P less than 0.05), and elevated mean arterial pressure to 62% +/- 4% of control (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that the decrease in perfusion pressure during TEA reduces SMABF with resultant evidence of intestinal reductive metabolism. The intestinal blood flow during TEA was improved by dopamine.\r"
