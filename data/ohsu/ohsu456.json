  ".W": "Leukotrienes (LTs) C4 and B4 are potent proinflammatory mediators with a wide variety of biologic activities, including smooth muscle contraction, mucus hypersecretion, and leukocyte activation, which may be of particular relevance to the pathology of asthma and other respiratory diseases. We measured the concentrations of LTC4 and LTB4 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 16 atopic subjects with asthma (eight symptomatic and eight asymptomatic) and from 14 control subjects without asthma (six with hay fever and eight nonatopic). The amounts detected in symptomatic subjects with asthma were significantly higher than in control subjects (LTB4, 0.58 +/- 0.06 versus 0.36 +/- 0.05 pmol/ml, p less than 0.05; LTC4, 0.36 +/- 0.1 versus 0.12 +/- 0.02 pmol/ml, p less than 0.01). LTC4 and LTB4 were also measured in 17 patients: nine with interstitial lung disease of varying etiology (cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis [CFA] or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), three with sarcoidosis, one with extrinsic allergic alveolitis, one with sulphonamide-induced pneumonia, and one patient with eosinophilic granuloma. The concentrations of LTB4 (but not LTC4) were significantly greater in patients with CFA compared with normal control subjects (0.69 +/- 0.3 versus 0.36 +/- 0.05 pmol/ml, p less than 0.01). There was a significant correlation (p less than 0.05) between the percentage of neutrophils and the concentration of LTB4 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) of the group with interstitial lung disease as a whole. This study provides evidence for a role for LTs in the airways of subjects with day-to-day asthma and suggests that LTB4 may also be involved in the recruitment of granulocytes into the lung in patients with CFA.\r"

  ".W": "B cells from patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVI) were investigated as to their surface-molecule display and their functional ability to transit through defined in vitro developmental stages. Patients' B cells were analyzed by dual color-flow cytometry and found to have an abnormal surface-molecule display characterized by depressed Leu 8 and CD21 expression. Membrane immunoglobulin (mu, delta, and light chain) were normally displayed. The lack of Leu 8 and CD21 expression did not represent the normal loss of these antigens from B cells with activation because the cells did not demonstrate enhanced display of activation markers, nor did they demonstrate enhanced display of early B cell molecules, such as common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen or CD5. Small resting B cells from the patients were isolated and tested for their ability to respond functionally to a series of activation, proliferation, and differentiation signals. B cells from 14 of 17 patients failed to transit from proliferation to differentiation with increased immunoglobulin production when B cells were stimulated with T cell replacing factor +/- phorbol myristate acetate. Cells of one patient failed to proliferate, whereas B cells from the remaining two patients with CVI did not undergo activation (size change and RNA synthesis) when they were exposed to antimu antibody or low-dose phorbol myristate acetate. These studies demonstrate that most patients with CVI have B cells displaying an altered-surface phenotype that is associated with a specific functional defect in transiting from cell proliferation to differentiation and immunoglobulin production.\r"

Survival correlates directly with the degree of hepatic dysfunction, although all patients regardless of Child's status have a statistically significant survival advantage when treated until esophageal variceal obliteration is achieved. All patients treated with EVS should be followed for life, but virtually all follow-up can be done on an outpatient basis. Shunt surgery should be reserved for: (a) patients whose acute bleeding cannot be controlled with EVS at the time of index bleed; and (b) patients who rebleed repeatedly or uncontrollably from gastric or duodenal varices. EVS is more cost-effective than other available treatments. It also effectively stabilizes potential candidates for orthotopic liver transplantation. Despite a progressive increase in the admissions for bleeding varices at our institution, the introduction of EVS has been associated with a significant decline in portosystemic shunt therapy. We believe that EVS is now the first-line treatment for all patients with bleeding esophageal varices.\r"

Multiple biopsy specimens were taken from 120 patients, including four normal controls, who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for evaluation of upper abdominal pain and discomfort, nausea, bilious vomiting, weight loss, and anemia. The patients included 58 men and 62 women, with a mean age of 53 years. Of these, 16 patients had gastric ulcers, 19 had duodenal ulcers, 26 had reflux gastritis (after either gastric surgery or cholecystectomy), one had a gastric polyp, one had Barrett's esophagus, and the remaining 53 had gastritis due to unspecified causes. Campylobacter-like organisms were demonstrated by light and electron microscopy in 50 of 69 patients of the nonbile gastritis group (72%) and in seven of 15 patients of the bile gastritis group (47%) (p0.05). The presence of bacteria in both groups correlated with histologically significant inflammation (particularly chronic active gastritis); similar histologic changes were noted in both major groups of nonbile gastritis and bile gastritis. Campylobacter pylori is common in all forms of gastritis in association with histologic inflammation.\r"

In those with CD, the small intestine alone was involved in 16% and ileocolitis was found in 58%; joint disease affected 11 patients (29%) and perianal disease 13 patients (34%). Twenty black patients (53%) underwent one disease-related surgical procedure, and 10 (50%) of those required two or more reoperations. Nine UC patients (35%) underwent surgery, and, except for three cases of sclerosing cholangitis (12%), black patients with UC showed no clinical findings different from white UC patients. In our American black patients, the course of IBD was similar to that of white patients, although in Crohn's disease the reoperation rate and the rate of joint involvement were higher in our black IBD patients; primary sclerosing cholangitis was also found in a larger percentage of black patients with UC than in our white patient population.\r"

The release of histamine was calcium- and temperature-dependent and did not involve cytotoxicity. There was an excellent correlation (r = 0.88; p less than 0.001) between the maximum percent histamine release from human basophils induced by rabbit anti-IgE (R-aIgE) and H-aIgE. H-aIgE was approximately 30 times more potent than R-aIgE in inducing mediator release from human basophils, skin, and lung mast cells. H-aIgE specifically desensitized human basophils to a subsequent challenge with both H-aIgE and R-aIgE. Lactic acid removal of IgE from human basophils blocked the releasing activity of both R-aIgE and H-aIgE. Passive sensitization with hyperimmune sera or purified IgE myeloma restored the response of basophils to both R-aIgE and H-aIgE. IgE purified from three different myeloma patients concentration-dependently blocked the histamine releasing activity of both R-aIgE and H-aIgE.\r"

The ETAF activity was assayed as the co-mitogenic activity of the crude epidermal cell supernatants on phytohemagglutinin-stimulated murine thymocytes. Lidocaine reduced the ETAF activity significantly, most markedly at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. The reduction was not caused by cytotoxicity, by co-production of inhibitory factors, or by modification of the ETAF molecule. Although the murine thymocyte assay was highly sensitive to lidocaine, the reduction of ETAF activity was not the result of carryover of lidocaine to the thymocyte assay. Our results indicate that lidocaine inhibits ETAF production in vitro, and suggest that conventional procedures, such as lidocaine anesthesia, which are acceptable for morphologic techniques, might not be suitable for functional studies of the cellular components of the skin.\r"

  ".W": "A simple, rapid, nonradioactive method has been developed to facilitate the direct detection of point mutations that cause genetic disease. The method operates on the basis of the specific amplification of a target allele by the polymerase chain reaction with extension primers designed such that their 3' end is placed at the mutation site. When this base is complementary to that of the specific allele, the DNA segment is amplified; when it is not complementary, the polymerase chain reaction cannot proceed. When alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) deficiency was used as a model, the technique of allele-specific amplification was capable of selective detection of five different mutations that cause the alpha 1AT deficiency state, including three different naturally occurring single-base substitution mutations (alleles Z, S, and Nullbellingham), an insertion mutation (Nullmattawa), and a deletion mutation (Nullgranite falls). Double-blind evaluation of 47 samples of genomic DNA demonstrated 100% accuracy of the method. The technique of allele-specific amplification is rapid, simple, and does not require the existence of a convenient restriction endonuclease site or the use of radioactive materials, and thus should have broad applicability for the detection of known genetic diseases in a highly sensitive and specific fashion.\r"

The age-adjusted overall prevalence of BH in the population of Copenhagen was estimated to be 10.1%; 12.5% in men and 8.2% in women. The overall prevalence of clinically relevant chronic airflow limitation (forced expiratory volume in 1 s less than 60% of that predicted) was 3.7% and not significantly different between sexes. Both airflow limitation and BH increased with age, smoking, alcohol consumption, short education, and low income. However, the association of airflow limitation with alcohol consumption, education and income was much weaker than the association with smoking. Regardless of smoking habits, the majority of subjects with airflow limitation did not report symptoms of bronchial hypersecretion.\r"

Neither clinical parameters nor histological subclassification correlated with patient outcome. In contrast, three immunologic features of these lymphomas showed a statistically significant relationship with actuarial survival. Neoplasms that manifested greater than or equal to 25% Ki-67+ cells (proliferation-associated antigen), less than 25% Leu 4+ cells (pan-T antigen), or less than 15% Leu 3+ cells (helper/inducer T-subset antigen) were associated with significantly decreased patient survival as compared to neoplasms with the reverse phenotype (P = .02, P = .003, P = .0005, respectively). Leu 3 findings were of particular importance in initial biopsies (P = .0007), while the Ki-67 findings were significant regardless of time of biopsy (P = .01 for biopsies at diagnosis and P = .004 for other biopsies). These data indicate that immunologic analysis can demonstrate subsets of diffuse small-cell lymphoma with different biologic potential, and suggest that such analysis be included in the routine work-up of patients with this type of neoplasm.\r"

However, the incidence and duration of these effects have not been systematically studied in a large outpatient oncology population. This survey was conducted over two consecutive 6-week periods in the adult oncology clinics of two university teaching hospitals. The objectives were: (1) to document the incidence and duration of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting; (2) to identify variables that influence nausea and vomiting; and (3) to describe patterns of antiemetic prescribing and compliance. One hundred thirty-eight completed patient-maintained diaries were returned (70% response rate). Anticipatory nausea and vomiting were reported by 9.4% and 6.5% of patients, respectively. Fifty percent and 27% of patients reported nausea and vomiting, respectively, on the day chemotherapy was administered (day 1: acute nausea and vomiting phase). Percentages fell to 22% and 11% by day three and 14% and 2.5% on day 5. Of patients who reported nausea and vomiting during the five-day period, 52% and 33% experienced nausea and vomiting, respectively, during the delayed period only (days 2 through 5: delayed emesis phase). Emetogenicity of chemotherapy significantly influenced incidence and duration of those symptoms. Sixty-seven percent of patients reported taking antiemetics on one or more days during the survey period. Of patients who reported antiemetic use, 92% reported antiemetics on day 1, 51% on day 3, and 31% on day 5. At-home antiemetic use was related to the emetogenicity of chemotherapy received. Patients who receive moderate to strong emetogens as defined in this report should receive antiemetic therapy for a minimum of three days. Increasing the dose of antiemetic prescribed both in the clinic and at home may be of benefit.\r"

The circumferential profile analysis was applied to determine the presence of transient defect (TD) and persistent defect (PD) preoperatively, and the fate of perfusion abnormality and asynergy after the surgery was assessed. Preoperative PET demonstrated 100 segments with perfusion abnormalities, including 69 TD and 31 PD. Fifty-six of the 69 TD (81%) improved in regional perfusion, while only four of 31 PD (13%) improved in perfusion postoperatively (p less than 0.001). Of 75 segments showing regional asynergy on contrast or radionuclide ventriculography preoperatively, 34 of 48 segments with TD (71%) improved in asynergy, while only five of 27 segments with PD (19%) improved in asynergy postoperatively (p less than 0.001). Stress-delayed 201TI tomography was performed in 22 of them. The predictive values for improvement in perfusion (77%) and asynergy (65%) were similar as those by [13N]ammonia PET (81% and 71%, respectively). However, the predictive values for no improvement in perfusion and asynergy by 201TI tended to be low (66% and 58%, respectively), as compared to those in 13N ammonia PET (87%; p less than 0.05 and 81%; p = 0.09, respectively). We conclude that an accurate prediction of reversible ischemia and asynergy can be achieved with rest-stress [13N]ammonia PET. Particularly, it can identify irreversible areas more accurately than the commonly performed stress-delayed 201TI imaging.\r"

In contrast, some cortical periventricular and sylvian lesions and all the parasagittal lesions well visualized in SPECT studies were not diagnosed by ultrasound scans. In neonates with subependymal and/or intraventricular hemorrhage the existence of a parenchymal abnormality was only diagnosed by SPECT. These results indicate that [123I]IMP or [99mTc]HM-PAO brain SPECT shows a potential clinical value as the neurodevelopmental outcome is clearly related to the site, the extent, and the number of cerebral lesions. Long-term clinical follow-up is, however, mandatory in order to define which SPECT abnormality is associated with neurologic deficit.\r"

  ".W": "A method of pretargeted immunolocalization of a mouse cell subset, using dual specificity monoclonal antibody conjugates and labeled divalent haptens, is described. Conjugates were prepared by coupling F(ab')2 fragments of an antibody specific for the allelic mouse B cell antigen Lyb8.2, to Fab' fragments of an anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl antibody. Divalent and monovalent haptens were obtained by coupling dinitrophenyl to peptides or to diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid. In vitro, divalent haptens bind with higher affinity to mouse spleen lymphocyte-bound than to excess soluble conjugate (affinity enhancement). In vivo, localization of 125I- or 111In-labeled divalent haptens in mouse spleen is much higher than that of the monovalent analogs. Thus, using divalent haptens, a new kind of specificity to target cells was achieved, suggesting that affinity enhancement may improve target to background ratios in radioimmunoscintigraphy.\r"

  ".W": "L-[2-18F]fluorotyrosine (2-18FTyr) was evaluated as a tracer of cerebral protein synthesis for positron emission tomography (PET). Its metabolism in murine cerebrum was studied. The uptake in brain reaches a value of approximately 2% of the injected dose per gram tissue after 60 min. The incorporation of the tracer into tissue proteins was proven by discontinuous SDS gel electrophoresis. The protein bound fraction of tissue activity increased to 84% and 89% after 60 and 120 min p.i., respectively. High performance liquid chromatography analysis showed a concomitant decrease of free 2-18FTyr in tissue with time. The sum of free 2-18FTyr, tRNA-and protein-bound 2-18FTyr in cerebral tissue gave an almost quantitative activity balance of 96 +/- 4% at all times examined. A significant formation of fluorodopa or fluorodopamine must therefore be excluded. This shows that L-[2-18F]fluorotyrosine is a promising tracer for quantitation of protein synthesis rates with PET based on a three-compartment model.\r"

  ".W": "The rapid progress in positron emission tomography technology has created the dilemma of how to compare data from old and new tomographs. We examined cerebral metabolic data from two scanners, with different spatial resolutions and methods of attenuation correction, to see if data from the lower resolution tomograph (ECAT II) could be \"corrected\" and then compared to data from the higher resolution scanner (Scanditronix PC1024-7B). Nine subjects were scanned on both tomographs after a single injection of [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. Regional and lobar gray matter metabolic rates for glucose were obtained from comparable images from each scanner. Ratios of lobar to global gray matter metabolism also were calculated. Regression coefficients and percent differences were computed to compare ECAT II and PC1024 data. Twenty-four of the 36 regions showed significant regression slopes, and PC1024 measures of glucose utilization ranged from 30% to 120% higher than those from the ECAT II. Lobar differences between the two machines were less variable (50% to 80%), and ratios generally differed by only +/- 5%. Since there was no simple and consistent relation between regional metabolic rates on the two tomographs, an overall adjustment of regional ECAT values for comparison to PC1024 values would be impossible. A region-by-region adjustment would be necessary. On the other hand, ratios are sufficiently similar that direct comparisons could be made.\r"

Of the 482 episodes of bacteremia, 164 (34%) were in children initially managed as outpatients.

However, 9 of these 20 children with complications were returned by their parents for reevaluation because of persistent symptoms and signs before the results of the blood cultures were known to clinicians. During the 12 years of the study, four cases of meningitis were detected directly as a result of the positive blood culture.

In CSF1, IL-1 beta was detected in 95% of samples; the mean (+/- 1 SD) concentration was 944 +/- 1293 pg/ml. Patients with CSF1 IL-1 beta concentrations greater than or equal to 500 pg/ml were more likely to have neurologic sequelae (p = 0.001). Tumor necrosis factor was present in 75% of CSF1 samples; the mean concentration was 787 +/- 3358 pg/ml. In CSF2 the mean IL-1 beta concentration was 135 +/- 343 pg/ml, and IL-1 beta concentrations correlated significantly with CSF2 leukocyte count, with glucose, lactate, protein, and tumor necrosis factor concentrations, and with neurologic sequelae. Tumor necrosis factor was detected in CSF2 specimens of 53 of 106 patients, with a mean concentration of 21 +/- 65 pg/ml. Of the 106 patients, 47 received dexamethasone therapy at the time of diagnosis. These patients had significantly lower concentrations of IL-1 beta and higher glucose and lower lactate concentrations in CSF2, and they had a significantly shorter duration of fever compared with the values in patients not treated with steroids (p less than or equal to 0.002). Our data suggest a possible role of IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor as mediators of meningeal inflammation in patients with bacterial meningitis, and might explain, in part, the beneficial effect of dexamethasone as adjunctive treatment in this disease.\r"

The present studies examined the relationship between the CD4 cell count and three functional assays: T cell colony formation in semisolid media, the capacity of PHA-stimulated cells to express IL-2 receptors, and their ability to synthesize and secrete IL-2. Cells from antibody-positive homosexuals with normal numbers of CD4 cells (greater than 700/microliters) showed defective reactivity in two assays, colony growth, and IL-2 receptor expression. These defects became progressively more pronounced in homosexuals with moderate (400-700 cells/microliters) and severe (less than 400/microliters) reductions in assays for IL-2 production by PHA-stimulated lymphocytes. Mixing experiments suggest that cells from HIV-infected men nonspecifically inhibit the colony growth of normal cells; this abnormality could be reversed by addition of exogenous IL-2. These data suggest that defective colony growth and reduced IL-2 expression are functional abnormalities directly resulting from HIV infection. Furthermore, these changes can precede the CD4 lymphopenia induced by this viral infection.\r"

Virus was recovered from blood mononuclear cells and viral antigen was detected in serum 12 days postinoculation (PI) in all inoculated animals. Virus was also isolated in all five animals tested 74 to 226 days PI. Antibodies to different structural proteins of SIV and HIV-2 were demonstrated by ELISA, Western blot, and radioimmunoprecipitation assay from day 31 PI concomitantly with a reduction of viral proteins in the serum. Reappearance of antigen accompanied by a fall in antibody to gag products (p26) was observed in two monkeys 69 days PI. All SIV-infected monkeys showed a pronounced decrease in CD4+ lymphocytes demonstrable already 12 days PI. They also developed persistent lymphadenopathy. Thus, infection of cynomolgus monkeys with SIVsm mimics events in human immunodeficiency virus infection in humans but the course of evolution of pathogenic events in the monkey is markedly compressed. This experimental model will be useful for evaluation of HIV vaccines and antiviral testing.\r"

HIV-2SBL-6669 had been propagated for a long time in continuous human cell lines whereas HIV-2SBL-K135 had been grown only in fresh human and monkey lymphocyte cultures or previously for a short time in a continuous cell line. Virus was isolated from three or four animals inoculated with HIV-2SBL-K135 but in none of six monkeys inoculated with HIV-2SBL-6669. All animals seroconverted although the antibody response was higher in SBL-K135 virus-infected monkeys. Varying degrees of lymphadenopathy were observed but there were no significant changes in the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The infection was transferred to two monkeys inoculated with blood from a previously SBL-K135 virus-infected monkey. Four animals inoculated with HIV-2SBL-K135, which had never been propagated in continuous human cell lines, showed strong antibody responses against both gag- and env- encoded proteins of HIV-2. None of the SBL-6669 infected monkeys showed antibodies to core proteins. HIV-2 infection of cynomolgus monkeys represents a useful experimental model for HIV vaccine trials and antiviral testing.\r"

Self-report data were collected from 556 men and women, ages 18 and 21, at two points in time. The data indicated that at least a minimum level of drinking and driving, as well as smoking marijuana and driving, is engaged in at least once for the majority of youth. Correlations between eight driving behaviors and consumption variables indicated that frequency of substance use was strongly related to frequency of driving while intoxicated (DWI). Regression analyses revealed that coping use of substances was the strongest predictor of driving under the influence. A path model examining the effect of stress, negative states and risk-taking orientations (T1) on driving under the influence as mediated through coping use (T2) was tested. Results showed that risk-taking orientation was the strongest predictor of DWI, both directly and indirectly (as mediated through coping use).

Measures were obtained from two drinking surveys conducted as part of a panel study of aging. Results indicate that the event of retirement was not a significant predictor of changes in average alcohol consumption, although retirees showed more variability between T1 and T2. Considering other binary drinking behavior variables, continuing workers and eventual retirees did not differ in the proportions moving into or out of the nondrinker status, or the situation of consuming an average of 3+ drinks/day. However, retirees by T2 were more likely to report the onset of periodic heavier drinking and problems with drinking. Evidence from this study indicates that retirement generally heralds no great shift in alcohol consumption or drinking behaviors.\r"

Posttreatment interviews were conducted with 81 patients approximately 6 months following discharge to assess the relationship between self-efficacy and relapse. As expected, self-efficacy increased during treatment and was higher among abstainers than relapsers at follow-up. Contrary to expectations, low self-efficacy at intake was related to longer inpatient residence and more positive conditions of discharge. Furthermore, abstainers had slightly lower self-efficacy scores than relapsers at intake and increased their self-efficacy two-fold over relapsers during the course of treatment. Contrary to previous research with tobacco smoking, self-efficacy ratings at the end of treatment were not related to substance abuse at follow-up. It is proposed that the present findings are consistent with previous research in demonstrating a relationship between self-efficacy and outcome, and provide new information suggesting that low self-efficacy may be related to positive outcome under certain circumstances. Hypotheses are advanced regarding (1) the potential utility of intreatment change measures, (2) the role of underestimation in self-efficacy ratings and (3) the role of denial in substance abuse populations.\r"

The reconstructive technique has been developed over the years through several ingenious methods of replacement. As a result of recent refinements in microvascular anastomosis techniques, many studies concerning one-stage, immediate cervical-esophagus reconstruction have been reported. An experimental study on esophageal reconstruction has been developed using a free intestinal transplantation in two distinct strains of rats. One of the groups consisted of a heterogeneous population of Wistar rats and the other an inbred Lewis strain. In our study the Wistar group reacted as in allograft transplantations and developed an immunological rejection process. The Lewis strain reacted according to isogenic transplantations. The surviving rats were killed and microscopical studies of the reconstructed esophagus were performed. This study is a low-cost, practical experimental model to achieve a better knowledge of the behavior of the transplanted organs.\r"

Here we derive new information from the study of Ca2+ movements induced both by InsP3 and a specific GTP-activated Ca2+ translocation process. The latter mechanism is clearly distinct from that activated by InsP3 and may involve the translocation of Ca2+ between compartments without its release into the cytosol. This idea is supported by the fact that GTP activates Ca2+ movement into the InsP3-releasable pool. In the light of this evidence we postulated that there are two intracellular Ca2+ pools distinguishable by InsP3-sensitivity and oxalate-permeability, and that movement between them is activated by GTP. We report here direct evidence for the existence and separation of two distinct Ca2+-pumping compartments with properties coinciding with those predicted. Of these, the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool is identified within a purified rough endoplasmic reticulum fraction, an observation consistent with recent InsP3 receptor-localization studies. Ca2+ translocation between pools may reflect function of a class of small GTP-binding proteins known to mediate interorganelle transfer in eukaryotic cells.\r"

However, since the demonstration of functional specialization in the macaque cortex, the question of a colour centre in man has been reinvestigated, based on patients with similar lesions in the visual cortex. In order to study the colour centre in normal human subjects, we used the technique of positron emission tomography (PET), which measures increases in blood flow resulting from increased activity in the cerebral cortex. A comparison of the results of PET scans of subjects viewing multi-coloured and black-and-white displays has identified a region of normal human cerebral cortex specialized for colour vision.\r"

About 10 of the approximately 100 genes of EBV are expressed in recently immortalized B cells and although there is circumstantial evidence that at least three of these may contribute to the process of immortalization, there is no direct evidence that any particular gene is required. We have developed a genetic analysis of EBV that uses a transformation-defective strain of the virus as a helper virus in conjunction with DNA that contains all of the viral cis-acting elements required for replication, cleavage and packaging during the lytic phase of the viral life cycle. This DNA can include viral genes required for immortalization that complement the transformation-defective virus strain. The DNA can be amplified and packaged by the products of the helper virus and the packaged DNA is infectious. We have analysed two viral genes expressed in immortalized cells and find that the gene encoding EBV nuclear antigen-2 is required for immortalization, whereas the gene for the EBV nuclear antigen leader protein is not.\r"

We now report the detection of high frequency (approximately 300 Hz) vibration of sub-nanometre amplitude in non-beating flagellar axonemes. This vibration could reflect the movement of individual activated dynein arms.\r"

Whether similar functional recovery could be established after a delay in the treatment was investigated. Rat spinal cords were contused and allowed to recover untreated for 10 days. At that time, a stimulator delivering 3 microA of direct current was applied to the dorsal portion of the cord such that the cathode was oriented either rostral or caudal to the lesion. Inactive stimulators were also used as controls. Rats were then assessed behaviorally and clinically at weekly intervals up to 3 weeks on an inclined plane and then killed for histological assessments. The results indicate that both the \"cathode rostral\" and \"anode rostral\" groups performed statistically significantly better on the inclined plane than the \"no current\" group. The cathode rostral and anode rostral group animals also demonstrated superior motor abilities. The number of axons in the dorsal funiculi rostral to the lesion in the actively treated groups were also statistically significantly greater than no current controls. The cathode rostral group animals demonstrated a greater number of viable neuronal cell bodies near the site of the lesion. These data suggest that electric fields may facilitate functional recovery and regeneration in the mammalian spinal cord, even after a delay in such treatment.\r"

In vitro human whey inhibited the growth of most but not all of the enteropathogenic strains tested. The test strains multiplied in both bacterial growth medium and commercial infant-feeding formula controls, with the exception of the Campylobacter strains, which were markedly inhibited in formula. These results confirm and extend previous observations that human whey contains components capable of inhibiting enteropathogenic bacteria and which may be associated with the protective effects of breast feeding. The precise mechanisms of these inhibitory effects merit further study.\r"

Because children usually acquire their infection from adults, it follows that we have had a concomitant rise in PPNG among sexually abused children. The Centers for Disease Control now recommends ceftriaxone for the first line treatment of gonorrhea but there are no data as to its use in children for this indication. From May, 1987, through March, 1989, 33 children, 4 days to 10 years of age, were admitted to Kings County Hospital for 34 episodes of gonorrhea. Nine (26.5%) were caused by PPNG. Twenty-three were female; 10 were male. There were 17 isolates from the vagina, 3 from the urethra, 9 from the pharynx, 9 from the rectum and 6 from the eye. Eight children (all girls) had infections at greater than or equal to 1 site; 2 were infected at 3 sites. Twenty-eight children were sexually abused and 5 were neonates with ophthalmia (1 PPNG). All isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone by disc diffusion testing. Agar dilution was performed for 18 isolates; minimal inhibitory concentrations to ceftriaxone were less than or equal to 0.06 mg/liter. The 5 PPNG isolates tested had minimal inhibitory concentrations to penicillin of 2 to 16 mg/liter and 3 isolates were resistant to tetracycline with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 32 mg/liter. Twenty-eight children were treated with a single dose of ceftriaxone, including the 5 neonates with ophthalmia; the dose was 125 mg if less than 45 kg or 250 mg if greater than 45 kg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Exposure of human T cells and some mouse T cells to the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an activator of protein kinase C, caused the dissociation of p56lck and CD4. Activation of protein kinase C may therefore interrupt regulation of p56lck by CD4 and alter the ability of p56lck to interact with polypeptide substrates. In contrast, exposure of cells to TPA did not cause dissociation of p56lck and CD8. Regulation of p56lck by CD4 may therefore differ from regulation by CD8.\r"

However, the relation between coronary arterial diameter (assessed by angiography) and true luminal size of arteries that are occluded and filled by collaterals has not been completely characterized. This study was done to measure the luminal diameter of coronary arteries before and after bypass grafting. Twenty-six patients (20 men and 6 women, aged 34 to 72 years) had coronary angiography before and from 1 to 35 months after bypass surgery. Coronary arterial luminal diameter was similar before and after operation for the 18 insignificantly narrowed arteries and the 24 arteries with narrowings that filled by anterograde flow before operation and were bypassed. In contrast, in the 21 arteries that were occluded and filled by collateral flow, coronary arterial diameter was significantly larger (p less than 0.001) after operation. Thus, when a coronary artery is occluded and filled by collaterals, its true luminal size is consistently underestimated by the angiogram.\r"

  ".W": "This study compared the results of stress and rest single-photon emission computed tomography imaging of myocardial perfusion using technetium-99m isonitrile (RP-30A) with the results of stress and redistribution tomographic thallium imaging and the results of coronary arteriography in 39 patients, 11 without and 28 with coronary artery disease (CAD). Each patient underwent 2 exercise studies at identical workload, heart rate and double product. In a subset of 13 patients, concomitant evaluation of left ventricular (LV) function using first-pass radionuclide angiography with a multi-crystal camera also was performed with bolus injections of isonitrile. Isonitrile had similar sensitivity (82 vs 82%, difference not significant), a slightly--but not significantly--higher specificity (100 vs 82%) and similar predictive accuracy (87 vs 82%) to thallium-201. The tracer uptake was assessed in 20 segments/study. There was concordance between the isonitrile and thallium-201 images in 723 of the 780 segments (93%) (kappa = 0.83 +/- 0.02). In general, the isonitrile images were considered of better quality than the thallium-201 images. All 10 patients with CAD who underwent concomitant first-pass radionuclide angiography had either perfusion abnormalities or an abnormal ejection fraction response to exercise. Thus, technetium-99m isonitrile provides a reliable method of assessment of CAD with a sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy comparable to that of exercise thallium-201 imaging. Additional advantages include better image quality and the ability to obtain concomitant assessment of LV function with the use of first-pass radionuclide angiography.\r"

  ".W": "We present herein a case of focal fatty infiltration of the liver, in which extremely unusual findings were exhibited on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the radiocolloid liver scan. Liver scan was performed on a 46-yr-old patient with a clinical picture of acute alcoholic hepatitis. Multiple hot spots were demonstrated by SPECT scan, and these lesions corresponded to focal fatty infiltration, which were proven by computed tomography (CT). These hot spots disappeared rapidly in accordance with the improvement in fatty change on CT, and with the improvement in the clinical picture. The hot spots in this case were believed to represent the nonuniform intrahepatic shuntings, which presumably caused the development of focal fatty infiltration as well. SPECT may be useful in detecting and monitoring the alteration of hepatic circulation in alcoholic patients with focal fatty infiltration of the liver when planar colloid liver scan shows a mottled pattern.\r"

Records from the Michigan Kidney Registry (MKR) for 1973 to 1984 were linked to those of the Michigan Cancer Foundation's Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System (MDCSS) to identify cases in the dialysis cohort. The expected number of cancers in the ESRD population was calculated using the race-, sex-, age- and calendar year-specific incidence rates of the tricounty metropolitan Detroit region of 4 million residents. The standardized incidence ratio (observed:expected) was significantly increased for all in situ tumors combined, as well as for invasive tumors of the kidney, the corpus uteri, and the prostate. The four-fold to five-fold excess (P less than 0.005) observed for renal and endometrial cancers, in addition to the significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) risk of prostate cancer indicates that patients maintained on dialysis should be evaluated for these tumors when they experience even minor symptoms. Population-based cancer and renal disease registries provide excellent opportunities for investigating etiologic hypotheses and future studies should incorporate potential risk factors when analyzing these data.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of major bleeding in outpatients treated with warfarin and to identify predictive factors known at the start of therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 565 patients starting outpatient therapy with warfarin upon discharge from a university hospital were reviewed. Follow-up information was obtained for 562 patients (99.5%). Bleeding was classified as major or minor using explicit criteria. The cumulative incidence of bleeding was estimated by means of survival analysis. Independent risk factors for major bleeding were identified using Cox regression analysis in 375 randomly chosen patients; they were tested in the remaining 187 patients. RESULTS: Major bleeding occurred in 65 patients (12%) and was fatal in 10 patients (2%). The cumulative incidences of major bleeding at one, 12, and 48 months were 3%, 11%, and 22%, respectively. The monthly risk of major bleeding decreased over time, from 3% during the first month of outpatient therapy to 0.3% per month after the first year of therapy. Five independent risk factors for major bleeding--age 65 years or greater, history of stroke, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, a serious comorbid condition (recent myocardial infarction, renal insufficiency, or severe anemia), atrial fibrillation--predicted major bleeding in the testing group; the cumulative incidence of major bleeding at 48 months was 2% in 57 low-risk patients, 17% in 110 middle-risk patients, and 63% in 20 high-risk patients. CONCLUSION: These findings provide a quantitative basis for evaluating the risk of major bleeding in individual patients at the start of outpatient therapy with warfarin. Whether the risk of bleeding can be reduced in high-risk patients without reducing the benefit of therapy remains to be determined.\r"

Whole brain metabolism was similar in the two groups, and region/whole brain analysis of metabolic data showed that metabolism in the calcarine posterior cortex was decreased by 14% (P less than .05) with eye closure. Glucose metabolism in other regions was not different between the two groups. In experiment 2, we compared glucose metabolism in six patients with severe bilateral optic neuropathies to 12 age- and sex-matched normal controls. Whole brain glucose metabolism was unchanged in the optic neuropathy group compared to controls. However, statistically significant reductions in glucose metabolism in the optic neuropathy group were found in anterior calcarine cortex (17%), posterior calcarine cortex (27%), peristriate cortex (27%), and lateral occipital cortex (15%). The metabolic effects of damage to the pregeniculate visual system went well beyond those of simple eye closure.\r"

The validity of iodoamphetamine (IMP) SPECT study in the evaluation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) or neurologic function is still controversial. In this study, the authors showed several cases in whom SPECT images of brain were not compatible with their neurologic deficits. In 2 typical cases, a large low-density area was observed in the non-dominant hemisphere in computed tomography (CT) scan, but no apparent motor-sensory deficits in left limbs were present. In these patients, SPECT study also revealed flow reduction in the affected side of the brain. So there was a possibility that an IMP brain image could not always reflect CBF, which maintains neurologic function of the brain.\r"

Sessions were performed as many times as needed for each individual case. One hundred seventy-eight patients in Child-Pugh class C were excluded from surgical treatment; the remaining 121 patients (Child AB) were selected using the following criteria: liver volume (ultrasound) between 1000 to 2500 ml, portal perfusion (sequential scintigraphy) more than 30%, no activity or progression of liver disease proved by biopsy, no stenosis of the hepatic arteries, and suitable anatomy to perform the Warren shunt. Only 32 patients fulfilled these criteria. In seven of these cases the shunt was technically impossible to perform. Operative mortality rate was 8% and the late mortality rate was 12%. No history of rebleeding, encephalopathy, and/or shunt thrombosis was recorded. Five-year survival rate, according to the method of Kaplan-Meier was 75%. We conclude that the Warren shunt is the treatment of choice for elective management of bleeding esophageal varices. The postoperative results can be improved with strict selection using the above criteria. The preoperative use of sclerotherapy has a positive influence. Prophylactic management to prevent encephalopathy is also recommended.\r"

The PBL were cultured with 5u/ml recombinant IL-2 and were repeatedly stimulated with irradiated fresh or cultured autologous tumor cells. Cytotoxicity was determined by four-hour chromium release assays. Specific cytotoxicity developed in 30 to 40 days, after three or four stimulations with tumor. The PBL-derived CTL are CD3+ and are mixed for CD4+ and CD8+ phenotypes. They lysed autologous melanoma and failed to lyse allogeneic melanoma, K562, or autologous lymphocytes. The lysis of autologous tumor was maintained for more than 4 months. The cells proliferated in response to autologous, but not allogeneic melanoma cells, in a dose-dependent manner. Lysis of the autologous tumor target was inhibited with w6/32, a monoclonal antibody to HLA Class I antigens. It is concluded that PBL may serve as a plentiful and renewable source of precursor cells for the generation of autologous tumor-specific CTL, which may be useful in specific adoptive cellular immunotherapy of melanoma.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) performed in the setting of emergent failure of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty causes minimal increased risk compared with routine CABG. We reviewed the records of 103 patients undergoing emergency CABG for failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (group 1) and compared them with an identical number of consecutive CABG patients from 1987 (group 2). Group 1 had a lower risk profile evidenced by lower mean age (p less than 0.01), fewer diseased vessels (p less than 0.0001), better ventricular function (p less than 0.001), fewer left main lesions (p less than 0.0001), and fewer patients with acute ischemia requiring intravenous administration of nitroglycerin (p less than 0.01). Despite these differences, the group 1 patients had a higher mortality rate (11% versus 1%; p less than 0.01) and a higher rate of perioperative infarctions (new Q wave) (22% versus 6%; p less than 0.01). An analysis of risk factors was performed in the group 1 patients using 36 preoperative and operative variables. Multivariate analysis revealed that left ventricular score (p less than 0.0001), preoperative (after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) need for inotropic support (p less than 0.005), and age (p less than 0.025) were independent predictors of operative mortality. In conclusion, emergency CABG after failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty carries a significantly greater risk of operative death and perioperative infarction than elective CABG.\r"

  ".W": "Of 2,859 patients having percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, 201 (7%) underwent emergency coronary artery bypass grafting. Two categories of patients were reviewed. Group 1 consisted of 126 patients of 2,304 who had immediate coronary artery bypass grafting after failed elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Ninety-eight of these patients had angiographic evidence of occlusion of a coronary artery, and 28 had angiographic evidence of coronary artery dissection. Epicardial hemorrhage was observed at operation in 20% (25 patients). Three deaths (2.4%) occurred in group 1, and an average of 3.3 grafts was performed per patient. Group 2 comprised 75 of 555 patients who had unsuccessful attempted percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty during an evolving myocardial infarction and required immediate coronary artery bypass grafting. Angiography revealed coronary artery occlusion in 61 patients with dissection in 14. All group 2 patients had evidence of myocardial injury by electrocardiographic and enzymatic (myocardial-specific isoenzyme of creatine kinase) criteria. Three deaths (4%) occurred in this group, and there was an average of 3.4 grafts per patient. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is routinely performed without surgical consultation, although an operating room and team are usually available. Supportive techniques include the intraaortic balloon pump and percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass. In those patients with coronary artery dissection, care must be taken to reestablish the true lumen of the coronary artery. Hemopericardium should be surgically explored and broken guidewires or other foreign bodies or debris removed. From 1979 through 1986, the number of patients requiring emergency coronary artery bypass grafting after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty steadily declined to less than 5%.\r"

  ".W": "The long-term patency of the internal mammary artery (IMA) graft is better than that of the saphenous vein graft in coronary bypass procedures. The better patency is thought to be due in part to a relatively low incidence of atherosclerosis in the IMA. In the present study, the incidence of atherosclerosis in the IMA was evaluated in a consecutive Finnish autopsy series of 160 patients. Forty-five patients (28%) had marked occlusion in some coronary arteries as well as a history of angina pectoris. Only 5 (3.1%) of the 160 patients had notable stenosis in the IMA. Three of these 5 patients did not have coronary heart disease. Macroscopic or microscopic signs of atherosclerosis were found in 12.4% of 314 IMAs. We conclude that the low incidence of atherosclerosis in the IMAs in our study is due to their good resistance to the sclerotic process, although the incidence of ischemic heart diseases in Finland is among the highest in the world.\r"

Although cardiac isoenzymes became markedly elevated shortly after the completion of 14 doses of IL-2 (100,000 U/kg of IL-2 every eight hours), serial electrocardiograms revealed only nonspecific changes. Echocardiography documented diffuse myocardial dysfunction, with akinesis of the anteroseptal region, suggestive of myocardial infarction. This anteroseptal hypokinesis persisted over a five-day period. The patient died unexpectedly and postmortem evaluation of the heart revealed a severe, diffuse lymphocytic, and eosinophilic myocarditis with myocyte necrosis, especially prominent in the anteroseptal region. This is the first histologically confirmed case of myocarditis reported, to our knowledge, in association with IL-2 therapy for cancer.\r"

The cells in the peripheral blood as well as those obtained from lymph node biopsy were strongly periodic acid-Schiff positive; the positivity was diastase sensitive. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of glycogen in the cytoplasmic vacuoles. Serologic tests were negative for human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 antibody. The data presented in this article support the existence of a vacuolated variant of peripheral T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and further expand the morphological spectrum of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.\r"

Age-adjusted rates by sex were comparable. There were no seasonal trends in incidence, but rates increased with time. On January 1, 1980, the prevalence of a history of ocular herpes simplex infection was 149 per 100,000 population (95% CI, 115 to 183).\r"

Clinical examinations disclosed bilateral corneal edema, no inflammation, and normal intraocular pressures. There was no history of similarly affected family members. The patients underwent penetrating keratoplasty at ages 4 months (patient 1) and 12 years (patient 2). Light and electron microscopic studies of the corneal buttons from both patients revealed areas of degeneration of the endothelium and separation of rounded endothelial cells. The morphologic features were strikingly similar to those in two acquired forms of corneal disorders--autoimmune endotheliopathy and \"acute endotheliitis.\" Immunocytologic and in situ hybridization studies for herpes simplex virus were not consistent with either productive or latent corneal infection. Ultrastructural changes in Descemet's membrane reflect delayed or abnormal development of the postnatal nonbanded layer in patients 1 and 2, respectively. These suggest an intrauterine insult that resulted in endothelial dysfunction. The histologic and ultrastructural features of these two congenital cases are not typical of those seen in any of the recognized causes of congenital corneal clouding. We propose that these cases represent a unique congenital corneal endotheliopathy of undetermined origin.\r"

In this in vitro study, over 100 foods, beverages, and drugs were diluted to concentrations potentially present in the stomachs of outpatients being evaluated for gastrointestinal bleeding. These were mixed with known concentrations of blood and tested with different brands of guaiac cards. Decreased guaiac test sensitivity was associated with activated charcoal, dimethylaminoethanol, red chile, N-acetylcysteine, rifampin, red Jell-O (General Foods Corp, White Plains, NY), orange juice, Pepto-Bismol (Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals, Norwich, NY), simethicone, spaghetti sauce, and several red wines. Chlorophyll and methylene blue-containing tablets produced false-positive results, but other blue and blue-green colored tablets did not, except at high concentrations. Previously described false-negative results with vitamin C, bile, and certain antacids were confirmed, as were false-positive results with iodide, bromide, cupric sulfate, iron salts, and hypochlorite. Physicians should exercise caution when interpreting guaiac card tests of gastric aspirates, especially in the outpatient setting.\r"

Initial angioplasty was successful in 1011 patients (87%). In 202 (20%) symptomatic restenosis developed. Of these, 196 were treated with redilatation; this was successful in 181 (92%). After a second dilatation, restenosis developed in 47 patients (26%). Of these, 41 (87%) were treated with a third angioplasty, with primary success in 38 (93%). A further restenosis developed in 13 of these 38 patients (34%). Eight patients were treated with a fourth angioplasty with restenosis in four (50%). Two of these four patients underwent a fifth angioplasty (with continuing success at long term follow up in both). Overall, 14 of the 47 (30%) patients who developed restenosis twice were eventually treated with coronary bypass surgery. Most patients (33), however, were treated only with repeated angioplasties. Of these 33 patients, 27 were treated with a third angioplasty, four with a fourth procedure, and two with a fifth. Twenty-nine (88%) were symptom free at a mean follow up of 28 (range 8 to 86) months. The combined success rate for a third, fourth, and fifth angioplasty was 94%. These data suggest that most patients with recurrent restenosis after angioplasty may be managed successfully and safely with repeated redilatations.\r"

Fifty seven patients who had angina that was not adequately controlled by standard medications were referred for elective coronary artery bypass surgery (group 1). Fifty seven other patients had symptoms that were well controlled on medical treatment (group 2). Patients underwent treadmill exercise testing (n = 109) and 48 hours of ambulatory ST segment monitoring (total 5125 hours). Patients in group 1 had more severe coronary artery disease and a shorter time to 1 mm ST segment depression and maximal exercise. Twenty two patients in group 1 (38%) and 16 in group 2 (28%) had greater than or equal to 1 episode of silent ischaemia during 48 hours of ST monitoring. There was no significant difference in the mean frequency of silent ischaemic episodes in 24 hours between the two groups (group 1 0.72 v group 2 0.64); however, the mean frequency of painful ischaemic episodes in 24 hours was greater in group 1 patients (0.51) than in group 2 (0.11). In both groups the frequency of silent ischaemia was significantly related to a positive exercise test, as was the total duration of silent ischaemia. The circadian variation of silent ischaemia showed a peak of episodes in the evening in both groups. The frequency of silent ischaemia in patients with coronary artery disease and angina receiving standard antianginal medications was not related to the severity of symptoms, but was significantly related to a positive exercise test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The influence of naloxone on the effects of high frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in angina pectoris induced by atrial pacing was studied in 11 patients with severe coronary artery disease. The patients were catheterised and treated with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on two occasions, double blind and in random order, with a single intravenous dose of saline or with a single intravenous dose of 50 mg naloxone. Treatment with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation increased tolerance to pacing and significantly improved lactate metabolism with placebo and with naloxone. The positive effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation were thus reproducible and not reversed by single intravenous doses of naloxone. The results indicate that the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on the heart are not mediated by beta endorphin but they do not exclude activation of more short-acting opioids such as delta or kappa receptor agonists (met-enkephalin or dynorphin or both) because naloxone has a low affinity for these receptors. Non-opioid mechanisms may also be important.\r"

Group 1 (506 patients) did not have important coronary artery disease, group 2 (69 patients) had coronary artery disease and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, and group 3 (55 patients) had coronary artery disease but did not undergo myocardial revascularisation. Early mortality (within 30 days of operation) was significantly lower for group 1 (6%) than for group 2 (13%) and for group 3 (16%). Operative mortality in all three groups was lower in patients operated on more recently. The three year survival of patients in group 1 (83%) was significantly higher than that of patients in group 3 (62%) but not than that of patients in group 2 (76%). The findings of this study suggest that the presence of coronary artery disease increases the risk of aortic valve replacement whether or not coronary artery grafting is performed. Myocardial revascularisation, however, seems to return patients with aortic valve and coronary artery disease to a survival curve similar to that of patients with isolated aortic valve disease.\r"

Suction blisters were produced on irradiated areas on days 0, 3 and 7 after UVB. Irradiated EC were harvested and co-cultured with autologous T lymphocytes in the presence of antigens (PPD, HSV) or mitogen (ConA). Culture supernatants were tested for IL-1 activity using the thymocyte comitogenity assay. We found that a single 200 mJ/cm2 dose of UVB caused an immediate suppression of the antigen-presenting function of EC, but no alteration in their IL-1 production capacity or surface marker expression (ATPase, CDI). PPD- and HSV-induced lymphocyte proliferation was decreased 70-80% and ConA-driven proliferation 30% when compared to non-irradiated EC. However, this suppression was restored on days 3 and 7 after UVB irradiation, this being coexistent with an increased capacity of EC to produce IL-1. It remains to be elucidated whether the immediate UVB-induced photoimmunosuppression observed in the present study is due to inhibitory mediators or impaired membrane function of EC or both.\r"

The results indicate that right-skewed G0/G1 peaks are seen frequently in both benign disorders and known and suspected CTCL. Such peaks may reflect increased stainability of DNA due to chromatin dispersion during cell activation and/or cell proliferation and do not constitute reliable evidence of malignancy. In contrast, discrete aneuploid DNA peaks are confined to malignant lesions, but are seen almost exclusively in the advanced stages in which the diagnosis can be established easily based on routine histological criteria. These data indicate that DNA measurements by flow cytometry is of only limited help in the early recognition of CTCL and support the view that the lymphoid infiltrate in early CTCL may be reactive (rather than neoplastic) or alternatively may contain only minor reactive (rather than neoplastic) or alternatively may contain only minor populations of abnormal (malignant) cells which cannot be detected by currently available DNA measurement techniques.\r"

Fifty-eight of these children also underwent analysis of the visual evoked potential (VEP), and 40 underwent colour vision analysis. Seventeen children were found to have complete congenital achromatopsia (rod monochromatism), being identified by their total colour blindness, reduced visual acuity, and reduced or absent photopic and flicker (30 Hz) ERGs. Two children with incomplete X-linked congenital achromatopsia were also found. This study identified the need to investigate children with nystagmus by means of the ERG and suggested that the ERG was useful where the diagnosis was uncertain, particularly at early school age. The incidence of congenital achromatopsia in a group of otherwise undiagnosed children with early onset nystagmus was high (29%), with 40% being classified as having congenital idiopathic nystagmus.\r"

The percent of Leu-11b-positive cells was 11% +/- 3% in the patients, compared with 12% +/- 4% in the control patients. Ten of 26 patients, however, had NK activity lower than all of the control values at three different effector to target cell ratios (E:T) (P less than 0.005). The values of those patients with low unstimulated NK activity remained low despite stimulation with interleukin-2 (IL-2) or alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN), whereas the values of those patients with normal unstimulated activity responded to IL-2 and alpha-IFN like the control patients. Three of the ten patients with low NK activity had a history of malignant neoplasms. None of the 16 patients with normal NK activity had a history of malignant neoplasms (P less than 0.05). We conclude that patients with myeloproliferative disorders frequently have low endogenous NK cell activity in vitro. The dysfunction of the NK system appears to be intrinsic because the relative number of NK cells was similar to control values and the response to stimulation with IL-2 and alpha-IFN was suboptimal. There may be a relationship between low NK activity and the development of malignant disease in such patients.\r"

There were nine primary tumors, 15 metastatic tumors, and five multifocal lymphomas. Co-bleomycin concentrations also were measured in primary and metastatic B-16 melanoma tumors in mice. In humans, metastases to lymph nodes (1.58 +/- 0.51 %ID/ml X minutes) showed significantly higher (P less than 0.01) tumor cumulative concentrations of Co-bleomycin than metastases to liver, bone, lung, and brain (0.76 +/- 0.20 %ID/ml X minutes). The cumulative concentrations of Co-bleomycin in human lymphomas (1.1 +/- 0.25 %ID/ml X minutes) also were significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than the concentrations in human metastases other than lymph nodes. The cumulative concentration in cerebral metastases (0.65 +/- 0.18 %ID/ml X minutes) was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than in noncerebral metastases (1.22 +/- 0.53 %ID/ml X minutes). Primary tumors in humans showed higher concentrations of Co-bleomycin than metastases, except for lymph nodes. In contrast with humans, murine metastases showed higher concentrations of Co-bleomycin (6.20 +/- 2.65 %ID/g) than primary tumors (2.94 +/- 0.90 %ID/g) (P less than 0.001). The concentrations of Co-bleomycin in murine tumors that were affected by bleomycin were about three orders of magnitude higher than in human tumors. The results of this in vivo study document the differences in drug delivery of Co-57-labeled bleomycin to human primary and metastatic tumors and show differences in drug delivery between human and murine tumors.\r"

The uterus was free of retained products but the lower uterine segment failed to contract despite bimanual uterine compression and intravenous oxytocin. Prostaglandin F2 alpha was injected into the lower uterine segment via a transvaginal approach. This was rapidly followed by cardiovascular collapse and later by pulmonary oedema. The differential diagnosis and subsequent management are discussed.\r"

In the three successive ten-year periods (1958-67, 1968-77, 1978-87) the incidence of PR-ARF fell from 43% to 2.8% with respect to the total number of ARF, and from 1/3,000 to 1/15,000 with respect to the total number of pregnancies. Maternal mortality was high (32%), with 5 cases of death in the last ten years. Irreversible renal damage was recorded in 11.6% of PR-ARF, and, in particular, in 26.3% of cases in preeclampsia-eclampsia (PE-E). Worse maternal and renal prognosis occurred in PE-E complicated by abruptio placentae. Neither disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), microangiopathic hemolytic anemia nor prostacyclin imbalance were significantly related to the severity of renal damage. Heparin therapy did not modify DIC evolution and renal outcome and was aggravated by severe hemorrhagic complications. In conclusion, PR-ARF has become a rare, but still critical occurrence, and the most effective measures would be a program of careful prevention.\r"

Carving is an important physical sign suggesting possible drug and alcohol abuse during adolescence. Eighty-five adolescent female patients in a long-term outpatient, self-payment, therapeutic community-type of adolescent drug treatment program, participated in a descriptive survey of \"carving\" behaviors. Forty-one girls (48%) admitted to deliberate cutting of their own wrists, arms, or other body parts without suicidal intent. Fifteen of the 85 girls (18%) cut themselves six or more times. Many girls had scarified their bodies with their boyfriends' initials as a visible means of demonstrating their affection and loyalty. They also carved rock group symbols or a Christian cross. Large and disfiguring scars were noted on 14 patients. The girls explained the behavior as a method of dealing with depressed affect, anger, emotional pain, or emptiness. Suicide attempts, usually by purposeful overdose of medication, had been made by 24 (59%) of 41 girls who carved themselves. Multiple suicide attempts were associated with habitual carving. Epidemics of carving, led by one or more angry, depressed, or lonely adolescents, may occur in closed facilities such as correctional institutions and drug abuse treatment facilities.\r"

Toe walking was found to be more frequent in those diagnostic subgroups with more severe language disorders. Toe walking also correlated with lower IQ scores (p less than 0.0001). The sensitivities, specificities, predictive validities and odds ratios all supported the hypothesized association between toe walking and language disorders. Further prospective studies of the neurodevelopmental outcome of children with toe walking are needed to determine whether this behavior can identify children at risk for language disorders.\r"

The effect of SM 201-995, a somatostatin analogue, was investigated in conscious cirrhotic rats before, during and after experimental bleeding from the portal territory. 3. Before haemorrhage, somatostatin analogue (8 micrograms h-1 kg-1 body weight, intravenously) produced a significant decrease in portal pressure (17%), whereas a placebo (saline) lacked significant effect. 4. The rats were then subjected to spontaneous bleeding, by disconnection of the portal catheter from the pressure gauge, for a 5 min period. At the end of the haemorrhage, haemodynamic parameters did not significantly differ between the group receiving somatostatin analogue and that receiving placebo. 5. Fifteen minutes after the end of the bleeding period, portal pressure was significantly lower in rats receiving somatostatin analogue [8.5 +/- 0.5 mmHg (1.13 +/- 0.07 kPa), mean +/- SEM] than in rats receiving placebo [11.0 +/- 1.1 mmHg (1.50 +/- 0.15 kPa)]. 6. The volume of blood lost and mortality were significantly lower in the group treated with somatostatin analogue (2.3 +/- 0.1 ml/100 g body weight and 8%, respectively) than in the group receiving placebo (3.0 +/- 0.1 ml/100 g body weight and 50%, respectively). 7. These results demonstrate, in an experimental model, the beneficial effect of somatostatin analogue for the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension. They suggest that administration of this substance should be started as soon as possible after the beginning of haemorrhage and continued after the cessation of bleeding.\r"

However, its longer term or local effects on bone turnover in vivo are unknown. To study these, we injected IL-1 alpha once daily for 3 days into the sc tissue over the calvariae of normal mice and examined its effects on calvarial bone morphology during the subsequent 4 weeks using quantitative histomorphometry. Increased bone resorption inside the calvariae and elevated plasma calcium concentrations were present 24 h after the last IL-1 injection. These early systemic effects were not prevented by indomethacin. During the following 3-4 weeks most of the bone on the injected side of the calvariae was resorbed by osteoclasts and was subsequently replaced by increased amounts of new bone. These longer term local effects on bone turnover were prevented by indomethacin. However, indomethacin did not prevent the formation of new bone inside the calvariae at sites of resorption induced by IL-1 independent of prostaglandin production. These findings indicate that IL-1 stimulates bone turnover systemically, independent of prostaglandin production, and that it has profound long term local effects on bone turnover that are mediated through prostaglandins.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormalities in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) during development of hypertension were investigated using in vivo and in vitro methods. Plasma ACTH responses to hemorrhage and ether stress were significantly smaller in 7-week-old SHR than in age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), while plasma corticosterone baseline levels and its response to stress were greater in SHR than in WKY. There was no significant difference in the plasma ACTH response to ether stress between bilaterally adrenalectomized SHR and WKY replaced with a 25% corticosterone pellet for 6 days. Adrenalectomy prevented the development of hypertension in SHR; however, corticosterone replacement restored hypertension. Plasma ACTH showed a smaller response to iv CRH injection in SHR than in WKY, while the ACTH response to arginine vasopressin was not different between SHR and WKY. CRH concentrations in the median eminence, posterior pituitary, and cerebral cortex were lower in SHR than in WKY, while the CRH concentration in the median eminence was not different in SHR and WKY when they were adrenalectomized with or without corticosterone replacement. Basal in vitro CRH release from hypothalamic tissue was reduced in SHR, while CRH release in response to 56 mM KCl was not different in SHR and WKY. These results suggest that adrenocortical function is enhanced in young SHR, that reduced ACTH response to stress and exogenous CRH in SHR may be ascribed to higher plasma corticosterone levels, and that corticosterone is essential for the development of hypertension in SHR.\r"

  ".U": "89338245\r", 
  ".W": "We previously identified a group of cytoplasmic phosphoproteins whose phosphorylation could be related to the multihormonal regulation of PRL in the homogeneous tumor-derived GH cell lines (set of proteins 1-11) and in heterogeneous normal anterior pituitary cells in culture (set of proteins 1-15). In normal cells, a mixture of hypothalamic hormones induced, like the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, stronger phosphorylation changes than TRH alone. Proteins of the set 1-15 are therefore likely to be present also in the nonmammotrophic anterior pituitary cell types, where their phosphorylation can be regulated by the hormones specific of the cell type considered. This interpretation is confirmed by the presence of the same proteins in cells of the corticotroph-like AtT-20/D16 cell line and the regulation of their phosphorylation by CRF. The same phosphoproteins were also detected in non dissociated anterior pituitary tissue from ovariectomized rats. Their phosphorylation was regulated by various hormones and other extracellular agents in a way similar to their regulation in anterior pituitary cells in culture. A 5-day estradiol implant pretreatment of the ovariectomized rats, which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland both directly and indirectly, resulted in a very high level of basal phosphorylation of proteins 1-15. Only very little further stimulation was achieved by the addition of exogenous hypothalamic hormones, indicating that the actual physiological regulatory pathways are the same as those unraveled in the various cell culture model systems. In conclusion, phosphorylation of proteins 1-15 1) can be related to the multihormonal regulation of the various anterior pituitary cell types in culture and 2) corresponds to intracellular molecular mechanisms actually involved in the physiological regulations of pituitary functions in the intact anterior pituitary gland.\r"

  ".U": "89338292\r", 
  ".W": "Fetal and neonatal calcium requirements impose heavy demands on maternal bone and mineral homeostasis. The functional response of maternal osteoblasts to this stress is poorly understood. Therefore, plasma osteocalcin (OC) levels were measured by homologous RIA in age-matched nonpregnant, pregnant, and postpartum ewes to evaluate osteoblast function. In pregnant ewes from day 35 of gestation to term, the plasma OC level was suppressed to 8.2 +/- 0.5 micrograms/liter (mean +/- SEM; n = 36) compared with age-matched nonpregnant ewes (18.3 +/- 1.1 micrograms/liter; n = 39; P less than 0.0005). Plasma OC rose to the nonpregnant value by day 20 postpartum and was elevated above this level for the following 40 days (e.g. 44.0 +/- 5.0 micrograms/liter at 48-53 days; P less than 0.0005). The timing of changes in plasma OC levels and weaning did not correlate. The validity of plasma OC measurement as a marker of osteoblast function was assessed by determining the OC plasma production and clearance rates using an [125I]ovine OC infusion method. The OC plasma production rates in matched controls (n = 6), pregnant (n = 9), and 48-53-day postpartum sheep (n = 7) were 1.5 +/- 0.2, 0.5 +/- 0.04 (P less than 0.001 vs. control), and 3.6 +/- 0.6 mg/day (P less than 0.005 vs. pregnant sheep), respectively. In one ewe studied longitudinally, the OC plasma production rate increased by 15 days after parturition and achieved a 10-fold elevation at 49 days postpartum. The OC plasma clearance rate (3.3 +/- 0.3 liters/h) was the same in control, pregnant, and postpartum ewes. It is concluded that 1) changes in plasma OC levels during and after ovine pregnancy reflected changes in OC production, 2) plasma OC measurements are likely to be a useful index of osteoblast function in pregnancy, and 3) osteoblast function appears to be depressed during ovine pregnancy and enhanced markedly in the interval 20-60 days postpartum. The relationship between osteoblast function, as indicated by OC production, and bone formation remains to be clarified.\r"

Plasma corticosterone concentrations were measured in separate groups of animals at the same time points, with females showing higher levels than males at all times, and both sexes exhibiting the well characterized diurnal rhythm. There was a significant decrease (greater in females) in the content of prepro-CRH (ppCRH) mRNA between midday and midnight in rats of both sexes. Previous studies have demonstrated that the content of ppCRH mRNA in the PVH responds inversely to changes in the concentration of plasma corticosteroid in a concentration-dependent manner. The present study suggests that ppCRH mRNA in the PVH may respond in a similar way to fluctuating concentrations of plasma corticosterone throughout the day, and that although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated, diurnal changes in the rate of CRH synthesis may be involved in the expression of diurnal rhythms within the hypothalamo-hypophysial-adrenal axis.\r"

Opsonisation of Campylobacter fetus, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter jejuni was mediated by antibody and enhanced by complement. Antibody was not, however, required for the phagocytosis of Campylobacter pylori because it activates the classical pathway of complement directly. This unusual property may be important in the pathogenesis of C pylori associated gastritis and duodenal ulcer.\r"

We have examined the action of bismuth subcitrate, the active ingredient of De-Nol, on gastroduodenal bicarbonate secretion by isolated amphibian mucosa. Addition of bismuth subcitrate (10(-6) to 10(-4) M) to the luminal solution produced a dose dependent increase in bicarbonate secretion from both gastric and duodenal mucosae without a change in transmucosal potential difference. The magnitude of this stimulation was greater for gastric than duodenal mucosae at all dose ranges. A second bismuth salt, bismuth oxynitrate, produced similar increases in bicarbonate secretion from gastric mucosae. Pretreatment of gastric mucosa with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10(-5) and 10(-4) M), did not abolish the secretory response to bismuth subcitrate. Similar treatment with the chloride transport inhibitor, 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS) (10(-3) M) prevented the secretory response to bismuth subcitrate.\r"

The prevalence of peptic ulcer increased with age, with a peak prevalence of 28.8% in the 5th decade of life. Peptic ulcer was not related to socio-economic status. The prevalence of complications, such as bleeding, stenosis, or perforation were similar to those reported in the West.\r"

Overall, 29 (32%) of the 92 patients treated with the addition of sucralfate rebled, compared to 37 (42%) of 88 patients managed by sclerotherapy alone (p less than 0.10), but when patients with well-compensated liver disease were considered, the respective figures were 14 (24%) and 25 (42%)--a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05). The frequency (approximately 70%), number (per patient) and extent of sclerotherapy-induced esophageal mucosal ulceration were not different for the two groups, although proven rebleeding from the ulceration occurred less frequently in those receiving sucralfate (10 and 20 occasions, respectively, p less than 0.05). Mortality was not different for the two groups. Thus, use of sucralfate will reduce the frequency of rebleeding during long-term treatment by sclerotherapy, although benefit appears to be restricted to well-compensated patients and without an endoscopic overt effect upon esophageal mucosal ulceration.\r"

The aim of this study was to establish the cause of increased ammonia liberation in the gut after intraluminal bleeding. Therefore, blood was sampled from catheterized piglets [20 +/- 0.8 kg (means +/- S.E.); n = 10] to determine ammonia, urea and amino acid levels before and 1, 2, 3 and 6 hr after a standard pig meal (750 gm, 12% protein). After 1 week, this procedure was repeated after ingestion of an isonitrogenous amount of bovine whole blood (400 ml). In a second series of experiments, the same procedures were performed after ingestion of plasma, whole blood, erythrocytes and feed. Electromagnetically measured total intestinal, small and large bowel flow was not significantly influenced by the type of meal ingested. Portal ammonia release was significantly increased 2-fold after a blood meal, whereas intestinal glutamine utilization did not increase. Plasma urea levels were increased 200 to 300% after whole blood and erythrocytes, whereas after ingestion of plasma, urea levels were similar to values in controls. Glutamine utilization was not different among the various groups and occurred predominantly in the small bowel. In the fasted state, small bowel glutamine utilization paralleled ammonia production. In the fed state, this equimolar relationship could not be assessed because luminal glutamine utilization could not be determined. Isoleucine levels decreased to 25% of fasting levels. Analysis of blood constituents revealed a complete lack of isoleucine in the hemoglobin molecule. Net total alpha-amino-nitrogen absorption was doubled after a blood meal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The most marked alteration was found in a patient with persisting neurological symptoms (\"complicated migraine\"). In most cases the areas of decreased tracer uptake corresponded to headache localization as well as to topography of neurologic symptoms during migraine attacks. It may be concluded that migraine attacks occur in connection with exacerbations of preexisting changes of cerebral autoregulation due to endogenous or exogenous factors.\r"

The involvement of thromboxane receptors in Forssman shock was determined with SQ 30,741, which was characterized as a selective antagonist of these receptors in guinea pig airways in vitro and in vivo. A volume of antiserum producing consistent, sublethal bronchoconstriction was given either alone (control) or 3 min after SQ 30,741 (0.03, 0.3, or 1.0 mg/kg iv) to urethan-anesthetized guinea pigs. In controls, maximum reductions in dynamic compliance (-59 +/- 6%, P less than 0.01) and increases in airways resistance (383 +/- 97%, P less than 0.01) were detected 1 min after antiserum. Both responses were significantly inhibited by SQ 30,741, either partially at 0.03 mg/kg or completely at 0.3 mg/kg. An accompanying thrombocytopenia was not abated by SQ 30,741. In separate experiments, bronchospasm was reduced by aerosol administration of 0.1% SQ 30,741 and completely prevented by aspirin (10 mg/kg iv). When Forssman antiserum was injected in lethal quantities to other guinea pigs, SQ 30,741 (1 mg/kg iv) attentuated only the resistance component of bronchospasm and did not prevent death. These data demonstrate that thromboxane receptor stimulation is a pivotal step in the pulmonary manifestations of sublethal Forssman shock but is less crucial in more severe forms of the reaction.\r"

In the absence of serum and insulin, muscles maintained at approximately 93% of resting length atrophied with significant decreases in dry weight, protein content, and contractile force, and in the levels of activity of citrate synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. Inclusion of 1.0 mU/ml of insulin in the culture medium prevented the decreases in muscle mass, twitch tension, and citrate synthase activity and minimized the decreases in lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and tetanic tension. Inclusion of 10% serum, in addition to 1 mU/ml insulin, in the medium did not have clear cut additional benefits. Stretching muscles to 110% of resting length (L0) resulted in marked deterioration with decreases in total protein, enzyme levels, and contractile force. Keeping muscles at approximately 93% L0 was as effective as maintenance at L0 in preventing atrophy and loss of contractile force and enzyme activities. This organ culture procedure, which maintains frog sartorius muscle in good condition without serum for at least 5 days, may provide a useful model for studying the regulatory mechanisms responsible for a variety of adaptations in muscle.\r"

The two forms of human CGRP as well as rat CGRP were capable of stimulating renal cortical adenylate cyclase activity in a concentration-related manner, with a half-maximally effective concentration (EC50) similar to that of human CT and approximately 100-1000 times higher than that of salmon CT. However, in the medullo-papillary portion, in which both salmon CT and human CT were inactive, the two forms of human and rat CGRP increased adenylate cyclase activity by 100%, with EC50 values ranging from 36 nmol/L to 1 mumol/L. In cortical membrane preparations the effect of CGRP was additive to that of salmon CT. We concluded that regional differences exist in the effect of CT and CGRP in human renal tissue and that in the medullo-papillary portion and possibly in the cortex, CGRP stimulates adenylate cyclase activity through a CT-independent mechanism.\r"

A progressive loss of the lumbar bone density was observed as a function of time after orchidectomy. Both the biochemical indices of bone resorption (urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio and plasma tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) and bone formation (serum osteocalcin and bone isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase) were significantly increased in the patients compared with healthy controls. A positive correlation was found between urinary hydroxyproline excretion and percent change in spinal bone mineral density per yr. Because of this increase in the biochemically indicated bone resorption, nine of the patients were studied again after 1-3 yr and were thereafter treated with intranasal calcitonin. Urinary hydroxyproline excretion normalized after 3 months of treatment, and a significant decrease, but not to normal levels, was also observed in the mean values for the other biochemical indices of bone remodeling. Thus, testosterone deficiency, like estrogen deficiency, is associated with accelerated bone loss. The increase in osteoresorption was partially corrected by calcitonin treatment.\r"

  ".W": "21-Hydroxylase-deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia (LOAH) appears to affect 1-6% of hyperandrogenic women. Screening and diagnostic criteria for LOAH have not been well established, as these patients are clinically indistinguishable from other hyperandrogenic women. The following prospective study was undertaken to 1) determine the predictive value of screening hyperandrogenic women for LOAH with a morning follicular phase basal 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-HP) level and 2) compare the various in vivo estimates of 21-hydroxylase activity after adrenal stimulation for the diagnosis of LOAH. Twenty-one euandrogenic control women (physically normal, without hirsutism, with regular menses, and a negative family history) were studied. The clinical population consisted of 164 consecutive unselected patients seen at the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine between 1983 and 1987 demonstrating hirsutism and/or hyperandrogenic oligomenorrhea. Controls and patients underwent acute adrenal stimulation with 1 mg ACTH-(1-24), administered in the morning to fasting patients in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. Blood was sampled before and 30 min after ACTH-(1-24) administration. Steroid RIA determinations were performed for 17-HP, progesterone, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, FSH, LH, and PRL. Three estimates of 21-hydroxylase activity were studied: the 17-HP level 30 min post-ACTH (17-HP30), the change in 17-HP (delta 17-HP0-30) and the summed rate of change in 17-HP and progesterone ([delta 17-HP0-30) + delta P0-30]/30 min). The upper 95th percentiles for these estimates of 21-hydroxylase activity in control women were 9.6 nmol/L (316 ng/dL), 8.8 nmol/L (292 ng/dL), and 0.39 nmol/L.min (13 ng/dL.min), respectively. Thirteen of 164 (7.9%) hyperandrogenic women had at least 1 abnormal 21-hydroxylase measurement. Four of these women (2.4%) had 17-HP measurements 3- to 20-fold above the upper normal 95th percentile (17-HP30 greater than 36.3 nmol/L or 1200 ng/dL) and were considered as suffering from LOAH. In our population the 3 measures of 21-hydroxylase studied clearly differentiated the LOAH women from all others, although a single 17-HP level 30 min post-ACTH was the simplest and most cost effective. Nine other hyperandrogenic women (5.5%) had at least 1 abnormal 21-hydroxylase measurement less than 3-fold the upper normal 95th percentile value and were designated as having mild 21-hydroxylase deficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Intraarterial AVP at lower doses (0.05 and 0.1 ng/kg per min) caused forearm vasoconstriction, whereas AVP at a dose of 0.2 ng/kg per min or higher caused forearm vasodilatation. The maximal forearm vasoconstriction was induced at the venous plasma AVP level of 76.3 +/- 8.8 pg/ml. Forearm vasodilatation was associated with the venous plasma AVP level of 369 +/- 43 pg/ml or higher. Forearm vasodilatation was the result of the direct effect of AVP since forearm blood flow and vascular resistance in the contralateral arm did not change. We attempted to explore the mechanisms involved in AVP-induced direct vasodilatation. The treatment with indomethacin, 75 mg/d for 3 d, did not alter AVP-induced forearm vasodilatation. In contrast, intraarterial infusion of isoosmolar CaCl2 totally prevented AVP-induced forearm vasodilatation. Intra-arterial CaCl2 also markedly attenuated forearm vasodilatation induced by intraarterial sodium nitroprusside, but did not alter forearm vasodilatation induced by intraarterial isoproterenol. These results indicate that the direct vascular effects of intra-arterial AVP on the forearm vessels are biphasic, causing vasoconstriction at lower doses and vasodilatation at higher doses. The direct vasodilatation induced by intraarterial AVP at higher doses is not mediated by prostaglandins but may involve cGMP-related mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The exposure of endothelial cells (EC) to fibrin has been shown to stimulate the rapid release of von Willebrand factor (vWf) from storage sites in Weibel-Palade bodies. We have now investigated the fibrin structural features required for stimulation of release. The role of fibrinopeptide cleavage was examined by preparing fibrin with thrombin to remove both fibrinopeptide A (FPA) and fibrinopeptide B (FPB) and with reptilase or Agkistrodon contortrix procoagulant to selectively remove FPA or FPB, respectively. vWf release was found to require FPB cleavage, whereas removal of FPA and Factor XIIIa cross-linking of fibrin were without effect. The dependence of release on FPB cleavage suggested that a site involving the NH2 terminus of the beta chain could mediate vWf secretion. To test this hypothesis, B beta chain derivatives were prepared and examined for their capacity to induce release. Purified B beta chain had no effect on release at a concentration of 20 nM but stimulated release from 26 +/- 6% of cells at 200 nM, the maximum solubility. However, after thrombin cleavage of FPB, release occurred from 36 +/- 9% of cells at 20 nM and from 60 +/- 7% at 200 nM, both significantly greater than before cleavage. FPB and B beta 1-42 showed no activity, whereas beta 15-42, representing the NH2 terminus of the thrombin cleaved beta chain, stimulated significant release at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mM. We conclude that FPB cleavage from fibrin is required for stimulation of vWf release from EC and that this is mediated by a site that includes the NH2 terminus of the beta chain.\r"

  ".W": "Autonomous in vitro growth of myeloid leukemic colony-forming cells may in part result from autocrine production of colony-stimulating factors (CSF). Some acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples, however, fail to synthesize CSF despite growing autonomously in agar, and are therefore believed to bypass CSF requirements. Cytokines such as IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-1, products of cells of the myeloid lineage, are known to be involved in growth control of myeloid progenitor cells. Since these molecules may also contribute to autocrine and paracrine growth regulation of myeloid leukemias, we screened a series of AML for cytokine production. In addition, possible roles of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 in growth control of AML were investigated in vitro. We show that a substantial proportion of AML cells produce IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1-beta and use these mediators to stimulate their growth by disparate mechanisms: IL-6 acts as a costimulator to enhance CSF-induced clonogenicity of AML blasts. TNF-alpha induces CSF production by endothelial cells and may therefore provide a paracrine loop to support leukemia growth.\r"

  ".W": "Several growth factors are potential mediators of wound healing, although their actual roles, interactions, and therapeutic use are not established. Six well-characterized human growth factors were chosen for detailed investigation by topical application to standardized skin wounds in swine: epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factors alpha and beta (TGF-alpha and TGF-beta), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). When applied singly in doses up to 1,500 ng, only TGF-beta produced a marked tissue response, as demonstrated by an increase in the new connective tissue volume, the collagen content and maturity, and increased angiogenesis. However, TGF-beta enhanced inflammation and caused abnormal epithelial differentiation and decreased epithelial volume, the last reversed by addition of IGF-I. Recombinant PDGF-2 homodimer, if given in combination with recombinant IGF-I, caused a similar increase in the new connective tissue volume and collagen content and maturity, but without increased inflammation. In addition, this combination stimulated increased amounts of epithelium with normal differentiation. The synergy of PDGF-2 and IGF-I was optimal at a ratio of 2:1 by weight. Of the six individual factors and nine combinations tested, the combinations of PDGF-2 and IGF-I or PDGF-2 and TGF-alpha were the most potent stimulators of healing in the absence of increased inflammation.\r"

  ".U": "89340889\r", 
  ".W": "Myocardial ischemia is characterized by the liberation of adenosine and by complement-mediated inflammation. We have reported that amidated C3, formed when ammonia (NH3) disrupts the thiolester bond of C3, serves as an alternative pathway convertase, generates C5b-9, and stimulates phagocytic oxidative metabolism. We investigated whether the deamination of adenosine by adenosine deaminase in hematopoietic cells might liberate sufficient ammonia to form amidated C3 and thereby trigger complement-mediated inflammation at ischemic sites. In the presence of 4 mM adenosine, NH3 production per erythrocyte (RBC) was equal to that per neutrophil (PMN) (3.3 X 10(-15) mol/cell per h). Because RBC outnumber PMN in normal blood by a thousandfold, RBC are the major source of NH3 production in the presence of adenosine. NH3 production derived only from the deamination of adenosine by the enzyme adenosine deaminase and was abolished by 0.4 microM 2'-deoxycoformycin, a specific inhibitor of adenosine deaminase. When purified human C3 was incubated with 5 X 10(8) human RBC in the presence of adenosine, disruption of the C3 thiolester increased more than twofold over that measured in C3 incubated with buffer, or in C3 incubated with RBC (P less than 0.05). The formation of amidated C3 was abolished by the preincubation of RBC with 2'-deoxycoformycin (P less than 0.001). Amidated C3 elicited statistically significant release of superoxide, myeloperoxidase, and lactoferrin from PMN. Thus, the formation of amidated C3 by RBC deamination of adenosine triggers a cascade of complement-mediated inflammatory reactions.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the possible mechanism(s) promoting alveolar fibrin deposition in the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we investigated the initiation and regulation of both fibrinolysis and coagulation from patients with ARDS (n = 14), at risk for ARDS (n = 5), and with interstitial lung diseases (ILD) (n = 8), and normal healthy individuals (n = 13). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) extrinsic pathway inhibitor activity was increased in ARDS BAL compared with patients at risk for ARDS (P = 0.0146) or normal controls (P = 0.0013) but tissue factor-factor VII procoagulant activity was significantly increased in ARDS BAL compared with all other groups (P less than 0.001). Fibrinolytic activity was not detectable in BAL of 10 of the 14 patients with ARDS and low levels of activity were found in BAL of the other four ARDS patients. Depressed fibrinolysis in ARDS BAL was not due to local insufficiency of plasminogen; rather, there was inhibition of both plasmin and plasminogen activator. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 was variably detected and low levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 were found in two ARDS BAL samples, but plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 was otherwise undetectable. ARDS BAL antiplasmin activity was, in part, due to alpha 2-antiplasmin. We conclude that abnormalities that result in enhanced coagulation and depressed fibrinolysis, thereby predisposing to alveolar fibrin deposition, occur in the alveolar lining fluids from patients with ARDS.\r"

Detailed analysis of the antiidiotypic MAb F5-444, F5-830, F5-963, F5-1126, F5-1336, and F5-1419 showed that all of them recognize idiotopes within or spatially close to the antigen combining site of MAb AC1.59. In cross-blocking experiments, the six antiidiotypic MAbs cross-blocked each other. It is likely that the six MAbs recognize spatially close, but not identical idiotopes because they elicited antiantiidiotypic antibodies of different or similar, but not identical specificity and differ in their ability to elicit anti-HLA class II antibodies. The latter, which were found only in sera from BALB/c mice immunized with antiidiotypic MAb F5-444 and F5-830, mimic the specificity of MAb AC1.59 and express the idiotope defined by the immunizing antiidiotypic MAb. These results indicate that the MAb F5-444 and F5-830 are antiidiotypes beta and the remaining four are antiidiotypes gamma.\r"

Immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed that most of the gamma delta T cell receptors existed as disulphide-linked heterodimers. Proliferative responses to mitogens were severely reduced, but specific antibody responses after vaccination could be detected. A thymic biopsy specimen showed severe abnormalities of both the thymic lymphoid and epithelial component with abortive medullary differentiation and almost an entire lack of Hassall's corpuscles. This patient represents a case of primary immune deficiency syndrome not previously described. Thymic deficiency associated with a high proportion of T cells expressing the gamma delta T cell receptor has been described in nude mice, and it is suggested that the immune deficiency of this patient may represent a human analogue.\r"

Six-day culture of lymphocytes from allergic patients increased after an additional 3 days of incubation with recombinant IL-2. This phenomenon was not observed when the lymphocytes of patients allergic to Df were stimulated with ovalbumin (OVA). Normal lymphocytes stimulated with Df expressed Tac antigen (low-affinity IL-2 receptor) but, in contrast to the patients' lymphocytes, did not absorb nor respond to IL-2. Nonadherent responder cells cultured with Df-pulsed autologous adherent cells acquired IL-2 responsiveness, but those cultured with OVA-pulsed adherent cells did not. The monoclonal antibody to HLA-DQ framework (Leu 10 and clonab DQ), but not to HLA-DR framework (OKIa1) and HLA-DP (HLA-DP and clonab DP-DR), blocked the antigen-presenting cells from inducing IL-2 responsiveness. Nonadherent responder cells depleted of OKT4 (CD4)-positive cells failed to acquire IL-2 responsiveness, whereas depletion of OKT8 (CD8) cells had no impact. Taken as a whole, the results indicate that DQ-bearing adherent cells from allergic donors play a key role in presenting Df antigen to allergen-specific responder T cells, which are very likely to be members of the OKT4 positive subset.\r"

The present study examines the prevalence of four diabetic complications: retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and hypertension, as well as depression, in older male patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes. Participants ranged in age from 53 to 80 years. Multiple risk factors, including age, duration of illness, type of treatment, metabolic control, and obesity were evaluated as predictors of these complications using logistic regression. Results suggest a significant increase in the prevalence of retinopathy with aging, independent of the effects of metabolic control, duration of illness, and other risk variables. Age was also related to prevalence of peripheral neuropathy symptoms, hypertension, and impotence. Current metabolic control was significantly associated with retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and hypertension prevalence. Time since diagnosis was only independently related to impotence and hypertension. These findings suggest that the increase in many diabetic complications in older persons cannot be wholly accounted for by simple disease status variables, and may result from an interaction of diabetes variables and general age-related changes.\r"

Treatment with PMA or OAG caused down-regulation of the TCR-CD3 complex, but only PMA, in combination with ionomycin, was capable of stimulating IL-2R expression and proliferation. Immunocytochemical staining with antisera specific for the PKC subspecies alpha, beta I, beta II, and gamma showed that untreated resting T cells normally coexpress alpha, beta I, and beta II PKC subspecies, which are distributed diffusely throughout the cell, with some localization around the periphery of the nucleus. There was no difference between the responses of these PKC subspecies to OAG and PMA, redistributing, after 10 min of treatment, to a discrete focal area within the cell. Treatment with OAG resulted in transient redistribution of PKC, maximal at 10 min, while in PMA-stimulated cells, the PKC redistribution was prolonged, persisting for at least 24 h. The results suggest that the difference in cellular response to treatment with PMA and OAG is not a consequence of differential activation of various PKC subspecies.\r"

  ".W": "Anti-delta antibody conjugated to 2 x 10(6) m.w. dextran (dex) stimulates B lymphocyte proliferation at 10,000-fold lower concentrations than that required by the unconjugated antibody. Dex conjugated antibody also stimulates a greater and more sustained increase in intracellular ionized calcium [( Ca2+]i) than does the unconjugated anti-Ig antibody. Inasmuch as inositol phosphate metabolites have been linked to rises in [Ca2+]i, we analyzed by FPLC the relative amounts of the inositol polyphosphates (IP) in these cells. Anti-Ig-dextran induced a threefold greater increase in total IP than did the unconjugated anti-Ig. Furthermore, in cells stimulated by unconjugated anti-Ig there was a transient induction of I(1,4,5)P3 followed by a rapid accumulation of the I(1,3,4)P3 isomer with little accumulation of I(1,4)P2, whereas in anti-Ig-dex-stimulated cells there was prolonged elevation of I(1,4,5)P3 with more accumulation of I(1,4)P2. In addition, levels of I(1,3,4,5)P4 were maintained over a longer period of time in B cells stimulated by anti-Ig-dex than in those stimulated by unconjugated anti-Ig. The enhanced ratio of I(1,4,5)P3/I(1,3,4)P3 was also seen when suboptimal concentrations of anti-Ig-dex were used which stimulated a level of total inositol phosphate that was similar to that stimulated by the unconjugated anti-Ig. The possibility that the greater stimulation of increased [Ca2+] by anti-Ig-dex than by unconjugated anti-Ig was a predominant factor in influencing the metabolic pathway of I(1,4,5)P3 was excluded. These results show that 1) stimulation of increases in the various IP isomers occurs in anti-Ig stimulated normal B cells as has been shown in B cell lines and 2) that signal transduction and consequent PIP2 hydrolysis that is stimulated by Ag-mediated cross-linking of sIg is strongly influenced by the extent and type of cross-linking that is induced.\r"

Thymic stromal cells fail, however, to stimulate proliferation of autoreactive T cell lines. This failure to stimulate autoreactive T cells does not appear to be due to tolerance induction because thymic stroma does not interfere with subsequent stimulation by spleen cells. Moreover, the ability of thymic stromal cells to stimulate autoreactive T cells can be restored by addition of exogenous IL-1. This demonstrates that the specific self-determinants recognized by autoreactive T cells can be expressed on thymic stromal cells. Failure of stimulation by thymic stromal cells in the absence of exogenous IL-1 may reflect a difference in the physiologic requirements for activation of autoreactive T cells as compared to Ag-specific, MHC-restricted T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that the isotype of an antibody response is selected, in part, by the inhibition of isotype-specific suppression. The antisuppressor model predicts that isotype selection is initiated through an interaction between Ag, Ig, and a T cell-derived factor within 6 h of immunization. This report characterizes some of these molecules and their contribution to isotype regulation. Cultures of murine spleen cells stimulated with the T cell-dependent Ag SRBC led to Ag-specific IgG and IgA responses that could be suppressed and then antisuppressed by a molecular complex produced by mixing purified serum Ig with the supernatant of Ag-pulsed macrophages co-cultured with T cells. The supernatants from separate cultures of Ag-pulsed macrophages and rIL-1 alpha stimulated CD4+ T cells, could be pooled and mixed with Ig to produce functional antisuppressive complexes thereby allowing the factors from the different cell types to be studied separately. Adsorption of the co-culture or the rIL-1 alpha stimulated T cell supernatants against monoclonal IgG or IgA, removed IgG and IgA binding factors, respectively, and abrogated the ability to enhance the corresponding isotype. The adherent material could be recovered and used to reconstitute enhancement by the supernatants depleted of the binding factors. When affinity purified IgG or IgA was used as the source of Ig within the antisuppressive complexes, the enhancement of the antibody response was limited to the isotype of the regulatory Ig used to form the complex. Thus, manipulation of the antisuppressive molecules has a predictable effect on isotype selection. Release of isotype-specific binding factors by CD4+ cells by rIL-1 alpha supports the hypothesis that T cell circuits play a role in initiating isotype regulation.\r"

  ".W": "Ag-specific and MHC-restricted Th clones of different Ag specificities and MHC haplotypes were tested for their ability to produce soluble factors capable of providing the signals required for B cell activation and IgG antibody production. Each of five Th clones tested generated significant helper activity in supernatants derived from coculture of the T cell clone with specific Ag and syngeneic APC. The same helper activity was detected in supernatants of clones stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 antibody in the absence of Ag or APC. The secreted helper activity resembled the activity of the intact Th cells in that it was Ag-specific, carrier-hapten-linked and MHC-restricted. These T cell products functioned to activate only those B cells expressing MHC products which corresponded to the specificity of each Th clone. Thus, the specificity of the cell-free T cell product mimicked precisely that expressed by the intact Th cell and presumably mediated by the cell surface TcR. In addition to the apparent presence of specific helper factor in Th clone supernatants, a role for nonspecific lymphokines was also identified in these preparations. Although recombinant or purified IL-4 alone was not sufficient to stimulate hapten-primed B cells to secrete hapten-specific IgG antibodies, mAb specific for IL-4 blocked the induction of antibody secretion by Th cell supernatant. These results indicate that stimulation of B cells to produce hapten-specific IgG antibody requires at least two distinct signals: an Ag-specific T cell signal which is restricted by MHC products expressed on the B cells, and a nonspecific signal mediated at least in part by the lymphokine IL-4.\r"

  ".W": "To identify epitopes recognized by alloreactive CTL we have examined H-2Kb-specific CTL for their recognition of synthetic peptides with sequences derived from the native Kb class I molecule. Consecutive nested peptides spanning the immunogenic alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of Kb were tested for their capacity to inhibit CTL clones in their recognition of cells expressing the native Kb molecule. Inhibition by these peptides was found to be an extremely rare event. One peptide (Kb.111-122) did inhibit recognition by one particular CTL clone, clone 13. Upon further investigation it was observed that clone 13 also recognized peptide Kb.111-122 when presented in the context of the syngeneic MHC molecule, Kd. Considering that residues 111 to 122 are located at the base of the antigen groove, and clone 13 is able to recognize Kb.111-122 when presented by syngeneic target cells, we suggest that inhibition of this CTL clone may be due to MHC restricted, self-presentation of peptide rather than to direct binding of free peptide to the TCR. Taken together, these results suggest inhibition of allospecific CTL by MHC peptides is a rare event at least for Kb recognition. Furthermore, they demonstrate the need for caution when interpreting inhibition by peptide as evidence for recognition by the TCR of the corresponding region on the native molecule.\r"

These cells remain unresponsive for up to 7 days after removal from IL-2. Cells rendered unresponsive to Ag by pretreatment with IL-2 also demonstrated reduced increases in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) after stimulation, hence this unresponsiveness is believed to result from absence of sufficient [Ca2+]i for activation of lymphokine genes. We have confirmed these observations, and demonstrate that only that portion of the [Ca2+]i increase derived from extracellular sources is inhibited in IL-2 pretreated cells. Further, inositol degradation and diacylglycerol production after stimulation are observed to be markedly reduced in cells rendered unresponsive by IL-2 pretreatment, suggesting that signal transduction leading to cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate after Ag receptor engagement is incomplete in these cells. However, treatment of IL-2 pretreated cells with AlF4- results in both production of inositol phosphates as well as increased intracellular calcium, suggesting that phospholipase C remains active in these cells. It appears that chronic IL-2 exposure regulates Th activation by inhibiting the signal transduction which follows engagement of the TCR.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of Ag specificity of TRC-gamma delta+ T cells in humans has been hampered by the fact that cloned lines of these cells expanded in IL-2 generally display high NK-like cytotoxic activity. A TCR-gamma delta+ CTL clone, isolated in IL-4, strongly lysed a specific stimulator cell, the EBV-transformed cell line JY, but failed to lyse K562 and other target cells sensitive for NK cell activity. Subsequent culture of this clone (CD124) in IL-2 induced high cytotoxic activity against the NK sensitive target cells. K562 cells were unable to induce the secretion of N alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester [(BLT)-serine esterase] or influx of Ca2+ ions in clone CD124 cultured in either IL-4 or IL-2. In contrast, JY cells induced high BLT-serine esterase secretion and an increase of cytosolic Ca2+ levels. By using a combination of a 51Cr-release assay and a BLT-serine esterase secretion assay, the reactivity of clone CD124 against a limited number of target cells was analyzed. CD124 which expresses HLA-A2 and -B7, recognized an Ag shared by JY (HLA-A2; B7; C blank; DR4,6) and one haplotype expressed by the cell line SPS (HLA-A1; B14; Cw6; DR4). The only specificity shared by SPS and JY was HLA-DR4. However, clone CD124 failed to lyse 5 other HLA-DR4+ target cells. The cytotoxic activity of clone CD124 was inhibited by the class I MHC specific mAb W6/32 and the anti-beta 2m mAb A88, but not, or only marginally, by the anti HLA-DQ mAb SPV-L3 or the anti-HLA-DR mAb 135. These data strongly suggest that clone CD124 recognizes a class I MHC Ag different from HLA-A, -B, or -C.\r"

Preincubation of these CTL with peptide 365 to 380 resulted in inhibition of target cell lysis. In addition, CTL lysed allogeneic targets in the presence of soluble peptide Ag. Investigation of the basis of these two phenomena revealed a requirement for expression of H-2Db molecules by the effector cells. Either preincubation with anti-Db mAb or the use of chimera-derived H-2d CTL specific for Db plus peptide ablated both peptide-dependent inhibition and lysis of allogeneic cells, suggesting these activities are a consequence of self-presentation of peptide Ag by CTL. Lysis of allogeneic cells appears to represent bystander lysis by CTL in response to recognition of peptide on other effector cells. Lysis inhibition is attributable to a highly potent form of cold target inhibition in which CTL serve as their own cold targets.\r"

Graded doses of each cell type were inoculated i.v. and/or s.c. into allogeneic recipients that were selected on the basis of their degree of immunogenetic disparity with the donors of the epidermal cell (EC) inocula. From 4 to 6 wk later the spleens or draining lymph nodes of recipient mice were assayed for specific priming of cytotoxic T cells. LC proved to be extremely powerful immunogens. As few as 10 MHC-disparate EC primed allospecific T cells of mice that received i.v. or s.c. injected cells. By contrast, at least 10,000 keratinocytes were required to prime appropriate recipients, and then only when these class II MHC-negative cells were injected s.c. Thy-1 dendritic epidermal cells failed to sensitize by any route in the doses employed. With the use of appropriate donor/recipient strain combinations, it was determined that LC can effectively prime cytotoxic T cells specific for diverse types of alloantigens, including determinants encoded by class I and class II MHC genes, as well as minor histocompatibility genes. The results of these in vivo studies confirm that, among EC, the primary alloimmunogenic stimulus resides among LC, and support the hypothesis that LC play a major role in the immunogenicity of skin allografts.\r"

  ".W": "The relative capacity of two coexpressed membrane Ig (mIg) isotypes, mIgM and mIgD, to actively transduce tolerogenic signals was evaluated with three human B cell leukemic clonal populations. Although anti-IgM mAb directed to various domains of the mIgM molecule suppressed spontaneous or T cell factor-induced leukemic DNA synthesis at concentrations as low as 0.01 to 0.1 microgram/ml, anti-IgD antibodies of both monoclonal and polyclonal origin failed to inhibit at doses as high as 100 micrograms/ml. Several possibilities for the differential capacity of mIgM and mIgD molecules to signal inhibition in these leukemic clonal populations were evaluated. Differences in the intrinsic membrane expression of the two isotypes before in vitro clonal activation were not responsible because the above distinctions were noted in cells of a chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which expressed slightly more mIgD than mIgM. The ineffective inhibitory signaling capacity of mIgD-specific ligands was also not caused by a selective decrease in the membrane expression of mIgD during cell culture, because the density of each isotype remained relatively constant during the first 44 h of in vitro activation by T cell factors, and following capping, mIgM and mIgD were resynthesized with similar kinetics. Because anti-IgM and anti-IgD mAb with comparable affinities for their respective membrane molecules differed significantly in inhibitory potential, it was considered improbable that the IgD-specific ligands tested bound to mIgD with a suboptimal affinity for inducing tolerance. Inhibition of leukemic DNA synthesis was observed after incubation with either anti-kappa antibody or a mixture of IgM- and IgD-isotype-specific antibodies, indicating that cross-linking of mIgD does not make B cell clones refractory to tolerogenic signal transduction through mIgM. These studies provide strong clonal support for the concept that coexpressed mIgM and mIgD molecules play distinct roles in human B cell immunoregulation.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of the spontaneous activation of B cells in patients with SLE was analyzed from the standpoint of the production of IL-1 from B cells and the expression of IL-1R on B cells. SLE B cells spontaneously produced IL-1-like factors which stimulated murine thymocyte proliferative responses. Their m.w. was about 17,000 and their isoelectric point was 4.8. The IL-1-like activity produced by B cells was absorbed with rabbit anti-IL-1 alpha antibody, but not with anti-IL-1 beta antibody. The differentiation of SLE B cells was enhanced by rIL-1 alpha, beta or IL-1-like factors produced by SLE B cells in a concentration-dependent manner. SLE B cells expressed large number of IL-1R detected by FITC-conjugated IL-1 alpha. By a Percoll gradient density centrifugation, IL-1-producing cells and B cells responsive to IL-1 were enriched in a higher density fraction, but were reduced in a lower density fraction. IL-1R-positive B cells were enriched in the lower density fraction, but were depleted in the higher density fraction. However, the expression of IL-1R on the lower density B cells was reduced by 2-day culture. The expression of IL-1R on the higher density B cells was increased during a 2-day culture. Anti-class II antibody inhibited the production of IL-1R on the higher density B cells. These results suggest that the cellular interaction among B precursor cells mediated by class II Ag induces the production of IL-1 and the expression of its receptors on their surface and the interaction between IL-1 and its receptors stimulates B precursor cells to spontaneously differentiate into Ig-producing cells as an autocrine mechanism in patients with SLE.\r"

We show that TGF-beta 1 selectively inhibits IL-3-dependent mouse bone marrow derived mast cell (MBMMC) proliferation without affecting MBMMC function or differentiation. TGF-beta 1 significantly decreased [3H]thymidine uptake by IL-3-dependent MBMMC in a dose-dependent manner with 50% inhibition of proliferation occurring with a TGF-beta 1 concentration of 0.1 ng/ml. A brief (i.e., 30 min) incubation of MBMMC with TGF-beta 1 is sufficient to inhibit IL-3-induced proliferation of MBMMC (cultured in the absence of TGF-beta 1) for 24 to 48 h. The inhibitory effect of TGF-beta 1 on the IL-3-dependent proliferation of MBMMC is not cytotoxic as evident from the absence of MBMMC trypan blue staining, the retained functional characteristics of the MBMMC cultured in TGF-beta 1, and the reversibility of the TGF-beta 1 induced inhibition of IL-3 dependent MBMMC proliferation. MBMMC grown in TGF-beta 1 acutely (24 to 48 h) or chronically (7 to 14 days) do not exhibit functional differences in performed or newly generated mediator secretion (Ag/IgE or calcium ionophore A23187 induced MBMMC beta-hexosaminidase or leukotriene C4 release) from MBMMC grown in the absence of TGF-beta 1. In addition, MBMMC cultured for 2 wk in TGF-beta 1 do not show evidence of differentiation as assessed by cellular histamine content or Alcian blue/safranin staining. Thus, TGF-beta 1 is an important negative regulator of IL-3-dependent mast cell proliferation in vitro, selectively inhibiting IL-3-dependent MBMMC proliferation without affecting MBMMC function or differentiation.\r"

This assay requires the presence of PMA and ionomycin. The main conclusions of these studies are the following: 1) IL-4 is a better growth factor than IL-2 for immature thymocytes (fetal day 15 or adult CD4-8-). 2) IL-2 is a better growth factor than IL-4 for mature phenotype thymocytes (CD4+8- and CD4-8+). 3) IL-4 is a relatively poor growth factor for adult CD4-CD8- thymocytes and CD4+CD8- thymocytes, while it induced strong responses in fetal day 15 and CD4-8+ thymocytes. 4) IL-6 enhanced the response of CD4+8- thymocytes to either IL-2 or IL-4. 5) Cortisone-resistant thymocytes grown initially with IL-4 and then switched to IL-2 showed a significant decrease in cloning efficiency. No inhibitory effect was observed when cells were cultured first with IL-2 and then switched to IL-4. 6) Finally, supernatant from Con-A stimulated rat spleen cells induced maximal growth of all adult thymocyte populations tested, suggesting that unidentified thymocyte growth factor(s) remain to be characterized. These results indicate that the maturational stage of thymocytes determines their requirements for activation and proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "Fresh human alveolar macrophages and blood monocytes were stimulated with LPS and assessed for their ability to produce and release antigenic IL-1 beta. Using a sensitive and specific ELISA for IL-1 beta, monocytes released 13.3 +/- 3.1 ng/10(6) cells compared to 3.5 +/- 0.8 ng/10(6) cells for alveolar macrophages (p less than 0.01). To investigate the reason for this difference in IL-1 beta release, monocytes were compared to alveolar macrophages for total IL-1 beta production (i.e., the amount released plus that detected in the lysates). Monocytes produced a total of 19.0 +/- 3.2 ng/10(6) cells whereas alveolar macrophages produced 24.8 +/- 5.6 ng/10(6) cells (p = 0.37). The relative increase in alveolar macrophage intracellular IL-1 beta was confirmed by Western blot analysis of cell lysates. Thus, the limitation in IL-1 release from alveolar macrophages appears to be due to a decrease in the processing and release of the IL-1 beta precursor. In addition, TNF production studies demonstrated that the limitation in IL-1 release was not a generalized defect. In contrast to the IL-1 beta data, when TNF was measured from monocytes and macrophages, monocytes released only 14.6 +/- 3.4 ng/10(6), whereas macrophages released 101 +/- 30 ng/10(6) (p less than 0.02). In this same context, when fresh monocytes were allowed to mature in vitro they took on monokine production characteristics similar to alveolar macrophages. In vitro matured monocytes had a greater than 20-fold decrease in their ability to release IL-1 beta and a 6- to 8-fold increase in their ability to release TNF. Taken together, these studies suggest that IL-1 beta release is limited in mature mononuclear phagocytes as compared to fresh blood monocytes, and furthermore, that IL-1 beta regulation differs significantly from that of TNF-alpha.\r"

  ".W": "The functional properties of two amino acid substitutions, characteristic of the bm3 mutation, in the Kb class I glycoprotein were analyzed in light of the HLA-A2 crystal model. The model predicts that amino acid residues extending into the proposed ligand-binding site or projecting up from the alpha-helices are functional with respect to peptide Ag presentation; whereas those residues pointing away from the site are silent. L cell clones expressing Kb, Kbm3, and derivatives of Kbm3, Kbm3-77 (Asp----Ser \"ligand-binding\") and Kbm3-89 (Lys----Ala \"silent\"), were generated for the analysis. Serologic characterization of this panel of cells by using the mAb B8-24-3, EH-144, 20-8-4, K9-136, and Y-25 (Kb but not Kbm3 specific) revealed the loss of the epitopes recognized by these mAb in the Kbm3-89 clone and the retention of these epitopes in the Kbm3-77 clone. Analysis of the L cell clones by using B6 anti-bm3 CTL demonstrated that L cell clones expressing Kbm3 or Kbm3-77 were lysed by these CTL, whereas clones expressing Kb, Kbm3-89, and Ld were not lysed. In reciprocal experiments, bm3 anti-B6 CTL lysed L cell clones expressing Kb or Kbm3-89 but were unable to lyse clones expressing Kbm3, Kbm3-77, and Ld. The results indicate that the substitution at amino acid 89 determines the Kbm3 serologic phenotype, whereas the Kbm3 alloreactive phenotype is primarily determined by the substitution at amino acid 77. These findings are in good agreement with the predictions derived from the x-ray crystal model of the HLA-A2 molecule.\r"

  ".W": "An early consequence of stimulation of T cells via their Ag receptor is the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). It has recently been shown that PKC activity resides in a family of homologous proteins. Inasmuch as T cells are phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous, we examined the possibility that this heterogeneity may be reflected in differential expression of message for PKC isoenzyme genes. RNA from six leukemic T cell lines was probed for PKC-alpha, -beta, and -gamma message before and after activation. These studies revealed significant differences among these lines. None expressed mRNA for PKC-gamma. Whereas all cells possessed message for PKC-alpha, there was consistent variability in the level expressed. The greatest heterogeneity was seen with PKC-beta. Two cell lines, HUT 78 and HPB-ALL, did not hybridize with the beta probe under any conditions tested. We subsequently used these PKC-beta negative cells to study the role of this isoenzyme in mediating some of the effects seen with phorbol esters that directly bind to and activate PKC. Our results indicate that PKC-beta, which is expressed in some T cells, is not necessary for PMA-induced CD3 or CD4 internalization, IL-2 production, or acquisition of the p55 chain of the IL-2 receptor.\r"

To determine the molecular basis for this polymorphism, we isolated total cellular RNA from PBMC of responders and nonresponders (defined by Leu-4-induced [3H] thymidine incorporation) and synthesized corresponding cDNA. Sequences encoding the extracellular domain of Fc gamma RII were then amplified using the Taq polymerase chain reaction. Amplified DNA fragments were cloned into pUC vectors, and sequenced. Analysis of clones from two nonresponders revealed a single base change (G for A) at position 519, which would result in the substitution of a histidine for an arginine at residue 133 in the mature Fc gamma RII protein. These findings suggest that the polymorphism involving human monocyte Fc gamma RII results from allelic variation of a single gene.\r"

Ceftriaxone and beta-lactamase activities were assayed in fecal samples obtained before and during drug administration, and anaerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and fungi were counted. In two volunteers, no fecal beta-lactamase activity was detected, but ceftriaxone was present during treatment at concentrations of 1.8-2.0 mg/g of feces. Concomitantly, fecal counts of anaerobes in these volunteers dropped from 10.5 to less than 8 log10 colony-forming units (cfu)/g of feces, and those of Candida species increased more than 100-fold. However, in the feces of the four other volunteers, beta-lactamase activity was high during ceftriaxone administration, but no ceftriaxone was detected. In these volunteers, ceftriaxone administration was not followed by any significant change in counts of anaerobes or Candida species. This appeared to be due to the intraintestinal hydrolysis of ceftriaxone by resident beta-lactamase-producing anaerobes. In gnotobiotic mice associated with a human fecal flora containing no beta-lactamase-producing anaerobes, it was possible to prevent the deleterious effects of ceftriaxone on intestinal microbial composition and on colonization resistance (against a strain of Candida albicans and one of ceftriaxone-resistant Enterobacter cloacae) by feeding the animals with an association of four beta-lactamase-producing anaerobic strains.\r"

Although C4A and C4B share certain antigenic and functional characteristics that identify them as C4, they differ with respect to other structural and functional properties. For example, C4B possesses four times the functional hemolytic activity of C4A. This suggests that homozygous deficiency of C4B might be associated with an increased susceptibility to infection. Forty-six children with bacterial meningitis were examined. Of these, 5 (10.9%) were homozygous deficient for C4B versus 7 (3.1%) of 223 controls (P = 0.038). There was no relation between the prevalence of heterozygous C4B deficiency and meningitis or between the prevalence of either homozygous or heterozygous C4A deficiency and meningitis. These results suggest that homozygous C4B deficiency is a relatively common immunodeficiency disorder that is clinically significant and predisposes children to bacterial meningitis.\r"

Sustained but self-limited bacteremia was observed in normal infant rats after inoculation with a disease strain. These rats developed meningitis and had depressed hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts. Pathologic examination showed meningitis and contiguous otitis. Pretreatment of infant rats with immune adult rat serum raised against disease isolates protected rats from bacteremia. Normal adult rat serum or immune rat serum against control strains failed to protect infant rats. Thus, strains of Hae isolated from patients with BPF are more virulent than control strains.

The sex rate ratios were uniformly higher for glottic tumors in all age groups, and these ratios increased more rapidly with age for glottic than for supraglottic tumors. Factors that are closely related to sex other than smoking and drinking behavior are responsible for the considerably high ratio of male to female rates of the glottic tumors.

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Manufactured silicone breast models were used to compare the accuracy of breast examination by 300 women and 62 internal medicine residents. DESIGN: The study design was cross-sectional. SETTING: The study took place in two teaching-hospital general medicine clinics. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Women were continuing care patients, ages 40 to 68, with no current breast complaint; 300 of 467 (66%) randomly selected women participated. Physicians were internal medicine residents with at least one-half day per week of ambulatory care practice; 62 of 64 (97%) participated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sensitivity equalled the percentage of 18 lumps correctly detected in examination of six silicone breast models. Specificity equalled the percentage of six models examined without a false-positive detection. Women's sensitivity was lower than physicians' (40% vs. 58%), but their specificity was higher (66% vs. 52%). For both women and physicians, sensitivity varied according to lump size, hardness, and depth, with women's sensitivity lower than physicians' for each characteristic. Examination duration was the technique most strongly and consistently related to accuracy. Physicians spent more time examining models than did women (2.5 vs. 2.1 minutes per model). For both groups duration related positively to sensitivity (r = 0.46, women; 0.55, physicians) and negatively to specificity (r = -0.35, women; -0.59, physicians). After adjusting for differences in technique, women's sensitivity remained lower than physicians', whereas specificity generally remained higher. The sensitivity of physicians with prior tactile experience with breast lumps was higher than that of physicians without such experience (60% vs. 51%, p = 0.01). Too few women (2%) had prior tactile experience to permit analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Women's and physicians' breast examination accuracies differ, but for the two groups accuracies vary similarly by lump characteristics and examination technique. Programs to improve breast examination should focus on specificity as well as sensitivity. Training that includes tactile experience may be important.\r"

A neurogenic constriction, attributable to the endogenous release of acetylcholine, is predominant under conditions of minimal and moderate tone. During a high degree of spontaneous tone, and in the presence of near maximal contractions induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine, the response to field stimulation is relaxation rather than constriction. This process was studied more clearly after blockade of the cholinergic effects with atropine. The relaxation response elicited by 5 Hz stimulation for 2 min consisted of two components, one occurring during stimulation and the other promptly after its cessation. The overall relaxation was sufficient to almost obliterate a spontaneous contraction or a near-maximal contraction to 5-hydroxytryptamine. The relaxation to transmural stimulation was unaltered by tetrodotoxin, adrenergic blockade, indomethacin or 5 days cold storage of tissue. Relaxation was elicitable even by a single pulse. With a few pulses, the maximal effect was achieved at 0.5 Hz. Repeated application of three pulses, in strips with spontaneous tone, led to substantial but transient relaxations, which simulated spontaneous rhythm. Removal of the endothelium was without effect on the relaxations, and they were unaltered by inhibition of guanylate cyclase. In the presence of elevated potassium (30 mM), contractions to 5-hydroxytryptamine and those generated spontaneously did not relax to field stimulation. Inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase with ouabain (5 microM) partially antagonized both components of the relaxation response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigations from our laboratory have shown that the benzene metabolite, hydroquinone (HQ), inhibits B cell production by preventing the maturation of pre-B cells. Data presented in this paper demonstrate that HQ interrupts B-lymphopoiesis indirectly by inhibiting the production of interleukin-4 (IL-4) by fibroblastic stromal cells. HQ exposure of fibroblastic stromal cells (SCL-173 and SCL-160) did not affect IL-4 production by these cell lines at any dose tested. Addition of untreated bone marrow-derived macrophages to HQ-treated bone marrow stromal cells (heterogeneous population of fibroblastic cells and macrophages) reversed inhibition of IL-4 production. However, addition of HQ-treated macrophages was without effect. Our studies suggest that HQ inhibits macrophage production of IL-1, a potent inducer of IL-4 production by bone marrow fibroblastic stromal cells. Interruption of IL-1 release from macrophages mediates the observed inhibition of B lineage cell maturation.\r"

All subjects were males aged 23 to 49 and none had active infectious or inflammatory diseases. All current or former heroin abusers were seronegative for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus. The methadone maintenance patients were socially rehabilitated and had not abused drugs parenterally for at least 10 years. NK activity was determined by a standard Cr-release cytotoxicity assay using K562 cells as targets, and lymphocyte subsets were determined by direct immunofluorescence using flow cytometry. At all three effector-target ratios (100:1, 50:1 and 25:1), NK activity was reduced significantly (P less than .01) in parenteral heroin abusers compared with methadone maintenance patients and apparently healthy individuals. The latter two groups did not differ from each other. Parenteral heroin abusers also had higher absolute numbers of CD2, CD3, CD4 and CD8-positive cells. These data support our hypothesis that significant abnormalities of cellular immunity in parenteral heroin abusers can be normalized by successful long-term methadone treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Repeated administration of clarithromycin (0.5 mmol.kg-1 p.o. daily for 5 days) to rats increased markedly the same cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme (P-450p) as that induced by troleandomycin. Clarithromycin, however, did not form cytochrome P-450 Fe(II)-metabolite complexes in vitro with microsomes from clarithromycin-treated rats or in vivo after repeated doses of clarithromycin. Nevertheless, clarithromycin formed cytochrome P-450 Fe(II)-metabolite complexes with microsomes from dexamethasone-treated rats in vitro, or after administration to dexamethasone-treated rats in vivo. Similar effects were observed with roxithromycin. In contrast, erythromycin and troleandomycin formed metabolic complexes when given alone, whereas josamycin, midecamycin and spiramycin did not form complexes, even in dexamethasone-treated rats. We conclude that clarithromycin and roxithromycin induce cytochrome P-450p, but do not form complexes with this isoenzyme, although they do form complexes with other glucocorticoid-inducible isoenzymes. We propose that macrolides may be classified into three groups, those forming complexes when given alone (e.g., erythromycin and troleandomycin), those forming complexes only in glucocorticoid-pretreated rats (clarithromycin and roxithromycin) and those not forming complexes (josamycin, midecamycin and spiramycin).\r"

The brachial artery was used in 10,500 patients (group I), and the femoral artery was used in 5850 patients (group II). Surgical intervention for complications was necessary in 60 (0.57%) of the group I patients and in 14 (0.23%) of the group II patients. Hand ischemia in group I and bleeding in group II were the most frequent indications for operation. Procedures performed were segmental resection, vein interposition, and long bypass in group I, and simple suture and angioplasty were performed in group II. Fifty-six patients of the total of 74 underwent early repair (within 48 hours), and 18 patients underwent delayed intervention. Only one (1.7%) of the 56 patients who had early repair had a complication. Five of the 18 patients (28%) with delayed intervention suffered significant complications. Cardiac catheterization by the brachial or femoral route has a low incidence of complications. Delayed intervention is associated with high morbidity despite adequate restoration of circulation. Although there were fewer complications in the femoral group, they were far more serious with respect to life- or limb-threatening events.\r"

We carefully examined 10 cases with onset of GBS within 10 weeks after immunization. Only 4 patients could recall recent symptomatic infection, and we found no specific agent in these cases.

The patients represented an unselected sample of various infarct locations within the left MCA territory and showed a wide range of aphasia types and severity. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that Token test performance mainly depended on parietotemporal metabolism, irrespective of infarct location. Frontal and basal ganglia metabolism did not contribute significantly to Token test performance. These results suggest that disturbance of language comprehension is due to parietotemporal cortical dysfunction in all types of left MCA infarction. Infarcts restricted to basal ganglia or the anterior part of the MCA territory apparently do not disturb language comprehension directly, but via their remote effects on parietotemporal metabolism.\r"

The initial change in the zonular fibrils was a loss of their regularity, next we could see fine granules deposited on degenerated zonular fibrils. A sparse and irregular deposition was found on the surface of the fibrils. Subsequently, the deposition became increased, and densely stained exfoliation materials, which were composed of a single degenerated zonular fibril and fine granules, were formed. Several fibrils accompanied by fine granules clustered together and became exfoliation materials of larger diameter. These observations suggest that degenerated zonular fibrils may develop into exfoliation materials.\r"

  ".W": "We report a rapid technique, based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), for the direct targeting, enhancement, and sequencing of previously uncharacterized cDNAs. This method is not limited to previously sequenced transcripts, since it requires only two adjacent or partially overlapping specific primers from only one side of the region to be amplified. These primers can be located anywhere within the message. The specific primers are used in conjunction with nonspecific primers targeted either to the poly(A)+ region of the message or to an enzymatically synthesized d(A) tail. Pairwise combinations of specific and general primers allow for the amplification of regions both 3' and 5' to the point of entry into the message. The amplified PCR products can be cloned, sequenced directly by genomic sequencing, or labeled for sequencing by amplifying with a radioactive primer. We illustrate the power of this approach by deriving the cDNA sequences for the skeletal muscle alpha-tropomyosins of European common frog (Rana temporaria) and zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) using only 300 ng of a total poly(A)+ preparation. In these examples, we gained initial entry into the tropomyosin messages by using heterologous primers (to conserved regions) derived from the rat skeletal muscle alpha-tropomyosin sequence. The frog and zebrafish sequences are used in an analysis of tropomyosin evolution across the vertebrate phylogenetic spectrum. The results underscore the conservative nature of the tropomyosin molecule and support the notion of a constrained heptapeptide unit as the fundamental structural motif of tropomyosin.\r"

This cardiomegaly was accompanied by severe myocardial and endocardial damage, which was concentrated in the left ventricular wall, and characterized by a progressive atrophy and necrosis of cardiac muscle fibers with concomitant fibrosis. This pathology was associated with congestive heart failure. Mice from five lines developed a marked trembling, correlated with expression of the v-fps transgene in the brain, and two lines showed a striking bilateral enlargement of the trigeminal nerves. Unlike tumor formation, these cardiac and neurological phenotypes were evident shortly after birth and showed 100% penetrance. The pleiotropic effects of the v-fps transgene suggest the involvement of protein-tyrosine kinases in mammalian neural development and cardiac function.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 7 (IL-7) is a 25-kDa cytokine which was purified and its corresponding cDNA was cloned based upon its ability to stimulate the proliferation of pre-B cells. It has been shown that IL-7 can also function as a costimulator with Con A for the proliferation of T lymphocytes by inducing the production of interleukin 2 (IL-2). We demonstrate here that IL-7 in combination with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate can directly drive the proliferation of purified T cells and that this response is not inhibited by cyclosporine A or by antibodies to IL-2 and IL-4. Stimulation of T cells with phorbol myristate acetate and IL-2, IL-4, or IL-7 prepared T cells to respond to any of the three lymphokines. Although T cells activated in vitro by anti-CD3 or allogeneic cells failed to proliferate when challenged with IL-7, T cells primed in vivo to the same stimuli demonstrated a significant proliferative response when restimulated in vitro with IL-7. IL-7 can, therefore, function both as a growth factor for T cells in an IL-2-independent manner and as a competence factor for the induction of lymphokine responsiveness. The ability to induce IL-7 responsiveness via stimulation of the T-cell receptor complex in vivo, but not in vitro, raises the possibility that IL-7 may play a role in T-cell growth and differentiation in vivo.\r"

The molecule recognized by the KN6 gammadelta T-cell receptor is expressed on syngeneic cells of various sources (peritoneal macrophages, thymocytes, spleen cells, and Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed cell lines) and on transformed cells arrested at an early stage of development (e.g., PCC3 embryonal carcinoma cells). Linkage of the gene coding for the KN6 ligand to the major histocompatibility complex genes could be demonstrated by testing KN6 hybridoma reactivity to cells from congenic strains that differ only at H-2. In addition, analysis of recombinant strains indicates that the gene controlling the KN6 ligand is located in or distal to the TL region. Involvement of the KN6 gammadelta T-cell receptor in this recognition process could be directly demonstrated by transferring the KN6 TL specificity after introduction of the productively rearranged KN6 gamma and delta genes into an alphabeta T-cell clone or into the germ line in transgenic mice. These observations raise the possibility that at least some gammadelta cells regulate hemopoietic cell maturation and activation.\r"

It was found that transfected cells responded to antigen-specific signals delivered via the Ealphak Ebetak, Aalphab Abetab, or Aalphak Abetab molecule. However, the B cells did not respond to signals generated by the molecule Aalpha kAbetak, Aalphab Abetak, Aalphak Abetad, or Aalpha kAbetau.

  ".W": "The response of cells of the murine megakaryocytic lineage to human interleukin 6 (IL-6) was assessed in serum-depleted cultures using a variety of biological assays. IL-6 alone had no influence on megakaryocytic colony formation but augmented the numbers of these colonies induced by the multipotent colony-stimulating factor interleukin 3. However, in liquid marrow cultures, IL-6 alone promoted marked increments in megakaryocytic size and the activity of acetyl-cholinesterase, a marker enzyme of the lineage. Moreover, IL-6 induced a significant shift toward higher ploidy classes when megakaryocytic DNA was quantitated by flow cytometry. To determine whether the influence of IL-6 on megakaryocytic maturation was direct, the factor was added to cultures of single megakaryocytes isolated from megakaryocytic colonies. Fifty-four percent of these cells increased in size compared with 19% of those grown without IL-6. The data show that human IL-6 is a potent direct-acting growth factor for murine megakaryocytes with activity promoting maturation of that lineage.\r"

In this study, the growth stimulatory properties of the sensory neuropeptides vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), substance P (SP), calcitonin generelated peptide (CGRP), and somatostatin (SOM) on cultured human keratinocytes were investigated. It was shown that VIP, in the presence of lethally treated 3T3 fibroblast feeder cells and epidermal growth factor (EGF), stimulated proliferation of keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner, whereas SP, CGRP, and SOM were ineffective. VIP stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in membranes obtained from cultured keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner, indicating an involvement of cAMP as second messenger in this reaction. Furthermore, 125I-labeled VIP was shown to bind to cultured keratinocytes and this binding could be displaced by addition of unlabeled VIP, suggesting the presence of specific receptors. It is therefore possible that VIP, released from sensory nerve endings in the skin, may act as a local mitogenic factor for human keratinocytes by stimulating adenylate cyclase activity via specific VIP receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) requires the concerted action of two virus-encoded transactivator proteins, Tat and Rev, and is in turn moderated by the viral transcriptional repressor Nef. We show here that the phenotype of a Rev- HIV-1 provirus was nonreplicating and was distinguished by accumulation of Nef protein and reduced Tat function. Provirus defective in both the rev and nef genes (Rev-Nef-) was also nonreplicating but had normal Tat function. Trans-complementation of the Rev- mutant with Rev caused a decrease of both the steady-state level and the rate of synthesis of Nef. This was accompanied by enhanced synthesis of viral structural proteins. Rev induced even greater levels of virus production from the Rev-Nef- double mutant. In contrast, exogenous Rev did not augment virus production from wild-type provirus. Virus production from Rev- and Rev-Nef- mutants induced by Rev was repressed by exogenous Nef. The repression induced by Nef could not be reversed by exogenous Rev. The ability of Rev to modulate Nef expression solely from the provirus, and thereby relieve the Nef-mediated inhibition of transcription from the viral long terminal repeat, reveals a delicate balance of the functions of these two proteins that might underlie the switch between latency and reactivation.\r"

To investigate the molecular basis for this difference, purified murine T and B lymphocytes were compared for their abilities to incorporate and metabolize stearic acid. Unstimulated T and B cells incorporated identical amounts of stearic acid into six different phospholipids and four neutral lipids. After mitogen stimulation, fatty acid uptake was increased in both lymphocyte types, but cell-specific differences were seen in the distribution of stearic acid among the various cellular lipids. Doses of stearic acid that selectively inhibited T-cell proliferation resulted in a 5-fold greater accumulation of distearoylphosphatidylcholine in T cells than in B cells. Whereas T cells did not desaturate the exogenously derived stearic acid, up to 25% of the saturated fatty acid was converted to oleic acid in B cells. These findings suggested a deficiency of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (acyl-CoA, hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.14.99.5) activity in T cells, which was confirmed by subsequent studies. Cell-free extracts from B cells displayed nearly 20-fold more stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity than T-cell extracts, and the level of stearoyl-CoA desaturase mRNA was 30-fold higher in B cells. Collectively, our data indicate that murine T cells are deficient in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. The deficiency of stearoyl-CoA desaturase in T cells may represent the basis for the differing sensitivities of T and B lymphocytes to inhibition by saturated fatty acids.\r"

Recombinant IL-1 (alpha and beta) stimulated fibroblast IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation, whereas recombinant TNF did not. In addition, simultaneous stimulation with recombinant IL-1 (alpha or beta) and recombinant TNF resulted in a synergistic increase in IL-1 beta mRNA levels. However, in all cases, IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation was not associated with fibroblast production of soluble IL-1 beta protein. Lysates of unstimulated, recombinant IL-1-stimulated, and recombinant TNF-stimulated fibroblasts did not contain IL-1 beta prohormone. In contrast, IL-1 beta prohormone was detected in lysates of fibroblasts incubated simultaneously with recombinant IL-1 and recombinant TNF. These studies demonstrate that recombinant IL-1 stimulates fibroblast IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation and that recombinant IL-1 and recombinant TNF synergize to further up-regulate IL-1 beta mRNA levels. In addition, they show that IL-1 beta production by human lung fibroblasts is inhibited at a posttranscriptional level. Translational control appears to be important in recombinant IL-1-stimulated fibroblasts and posttranslational control is important in fibroblasts stimulated simultaneously with recombinant IL-1 and recombinant TNF.\r"

Moreover, by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, greater than 90% of DR3 (DRw17), DQw2 celiac disease patients have a polymorphic 4.0-kilobase Rsa I DP B gene DNA fragment. The present study sought to determine if there is a unique HLA class II D-region A or B gene structural variant on the DR3 (DRw17) haplotype found in celiac disease. The polymorphic second exons of the coding DRB, DQA and DQB, and DPA and DPB genes in celiac disease patients with the DR3 (DRw17) haplotype were sequenced after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. To define the DP B genes associated with celiac disease, the second exons of the coding DP B genes from 27 celiac disease patients were amplified similarly and probed by using a panel of sequence specific oligonucleotides. The HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP A and B gene second exon sequences of celiac disease patients were noted to be identical to sequences that can be found also, although at a significantly lower frequency, in unaffected individuals. This is compatible with a disease model wherein the HLA class II genes on the DR3 (DRw17) haplotype are necessary, but not sufficient, for the phenotypic expression of celiac disease. Analysis of the DP B genes revealed a significant increase in the frequency of the alleles DPB1 and DPB3 in celiac disease. Furthermore, the increased frequency of the 4.0-kilobase Rsa I DP B gene restriction fragment length polymorphism in celiac disease can be accounted for by the overrepresentation in disease of the alleles DPB1 and DPB3. The HLA-associated susceptibility to celiac disease appears to be multigenic, with specific, but structurally normal, allelic variants in the DP and DQ/DR subregions contributing to disease susceptibility.\r"

Incubation with hGH, but not hPrl, increased levels of InsP3 and diacylglycerol in a concentration-dependent manner. Half-maximal effects occurred between 0.1 and 1 nM hGH. Increased levels of InsP3 were measured after as little as 5 sec of incubation with 1 nM hGH, and increase was maximal after 15 sec. Increases were no longer detectable after 60 sec because of dephosphorylation of InsP3 in membrane suspensions. hGH did not affect rates of dephosphorylation. hGH-stimulated increases in InsP3 were detectable in membranes suspended in 0, 0.1, and 0.2 mM calcium but not in 0.3 or 1.0 microMs calcium. 125I-labeled hGH-receptor complexes with Mr values of 66,000 and 140,000 were identified in isolated basolateral membranes. Our findings establish that GH activates phospholipase C (phosphatidylcholine cholinephosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.3) in isolated canine renal proximal tubular basolateral membranes, potentially after binding to a specific receptor. This process could mediate \"signal\" transmission by GH across the plasma membrane of the proximal tubular cell and elsewhere.\r"

  ".W": "Low doses (50-200 pg or 3.1-12.4 fmol) of interleukin 1 (IL-1) infused into the brain of rats produced rapid suppression of various cellular immune responses in peripheral lymphocytes of rats. Fifteen minutes after infusion of purified IL-1 beta into the lateral ventricle, natural killer cell activity, response to phytohemagglutinin stimulation, and interleukin 2 production were markedly suppressed in lymphocytes isolated from blood and spleen. These effects were due to infusion of IL-1 into brain since they did not occur when IL-1 was infused into the cisterna magna (essentially posterior to brain) or was injected intraperitoneally. Effects of IL-1 in brain could be blocked by simultaneous infusion of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which is known to block the biological actions of IL-1. To stimulate release of endogenous IL-1 in brain, lipopolysaccharide was infused; this produced similar effects as IL-1, and these effects also were blocked by alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. At longer intervals after infusion of IL-1 and lipopolysaccharide (3, 6, and 24 hr), immune responses returned to baseline or remained suppressed; i.e., \"rebound\" immunopotentiation did not occur. Finally, IL-1 infusion suppressed cellular immune responses in adrenalectomized animals, thereby showing that the effects of central IL-1 on peripheral cellular immune responses were, at least in part, independent of the stimulatory effect of IL-1 on secretion of adrenal hormones. These results indicate a link from brain to peripheral immune responses by means of action of a cytokine acting in the brain.\r"

Each sputum sample was cytocentrifuged onto two slides. One slide was stained with Gomori methenamine-silver (GMS) and the other with cresyl violet (CV). Among the 62 study patients, 18 were proven to have no histologic evidence of P carinii pneumonia.

Among those with a positive CV stain, the diagnosis was made on the first sputum specimen in 14 patients and on the second specimen in the remaining four patients. CV stain is at least as sensitive as GMS in detecting P carinii cysts in the sputum of AIDS patients with P carinii pneumonia, and its diagnostic sensitivity may exceed 40% under field conditions. Further, CV stain is much simpler to prepare than GMS and much simpler to interpret than Giemsa.

We hypothesized that administration of IL-2 might be more effective as adjuvant therapy in the presence of a greatly diminished tumor burden after tumor excision. In this BALB/c methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma model, excision of 0.3 to 0.4 gm tumors results in local recurrence rates of 50% to 70%. Administration of human recombinant IL-2 at a dose of 50,000 units three times daily for 5 days to animals with established tumors resulted in 100% mortality. IL-2 administration started at the time of tumor implantation had no effect on tumor growth. Mice receiving adjuvant IL-2 at 50,000 units per dose after surgery had prolonged survival compared with controls (79% vs. 32%, p = 0.007); addition of concanavalin A-activated lymphocytes to IL-2 therapy did not enhance survival over that with IL-2 alone. Therapy with lower doses of adjuvant IL-2 on the same treatment schedule resulted in improved survival at doses as low as 5000 units (86% vs. 51% for controls, p = 0.003). Although the exact mechanism of this therapeutic effect has not been determined, IL-2 may act by a variety of mechanisms, including a decrease in the immunosuppressive effects of anesthesia and surgery, the generation of endogenous IL-2-activated effector cells, and the augmentation of efflux of circulating effector cells from peripheral blood into the site of surgically induced inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "In a murine pulmonary metastases model, interleukin-2 (IL-2), a lymphokine capable of expanding all classes of T lymphocytes, synergizes with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) to reduce established metastases and prolong survival. We tested whether indomethacin (INDO), which inhibits synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (a potent immunosuppressor), could further augment the antitumor efficacy of these lymphokines. Age-matched C57BL/6 mice bearing pulmonary micrometastases of a weakly immunogenic fibrosarcoma MCA-106 were treated intraperitoneally for 6 consecutive days, starting on day 3 with (1) saline solution, (2) IL-2 (50,000 units twice a day), (3) IFN-alpha A/D (50,000 units per day), and (4) IL-2 and IFN-alpha A/D. Half of each treatment group was given plain water and the rest INDO-treated (14 micrograms/cc) drinking water throughout the duration of the experiment. Pulmonary metastases were enumerated on day 21. IFN or INDO alone had little effect, whereas IL-2 reduced metastases and prolonged survival. All combination treatments, including INDO/IFN, decreased metastases and prolonged survival except INDO/IL-2/IFN in which several early deaths negated any significant survival prolongation. Early mortality (less than 21 days) was seen with IFN/INDO (8.3%), IL-2/IFN (7.7%), and IL-2/IFN/INDO (8.3%) indicating toxicity of these treatments. Spontaneous proliferation of splenocytes from non-tumor-bearing mice treated for 5 days showed that INDO combined with IL-2 or IFN enhanced proliferation measured 3 days after cessation or treatments. A striking reduction in T-cell marker (Thy 1.2+) in groups treated with IL-2/IFN, INDO/IL-2, INDO/IFN, and INDO/IL-2/IFN 3 days after cessation of IL-2 and IFN suggests that a non-T-cell is amplified when INDO is combined with IL-2 or IFN. These results show that INDO can enhance efficacy of IL-2 or IL-2/IFN. Furthermore, INDO/IFN offers an equi-efficacious, albeit similarly toxic, alternative to IL-2 treatment of tumors and may be useful clinically.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to provide information useful for improving tumor immunotherapy, we examined the lymphokine requirements for generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) from C57BL/6 murine thymocytes. Our previous work indicated that interleukin-6 (IL-6) is involved in the maturation of CTL in vitro. Using a standard chromium 51 release assay and P815 mastocytoma tumor cells as targets, we found that after 66 hours of in vitro culture, a much greater CTL response was generated in the presence of interleukin-2 (IL-2) plus IL-6 (70.5% +/- 10.6%) compared with that generated in the presence of IL-2 only (25.2% +/- 1.0%). After 72 hours of culture, however, this difference was no longer significant, with cultures incubated with both IL-2 and IL-6 yielding 70.6% +/- 1.8% lysis versus 64.5% +/- 3.4% for cultures incubated with IL-2 only. To attempt to understand this difference, we examined the production of IL-6 in thymocyte cultures using a cell line, PC-6, that proliferates in the presence of IL-6. We found that the CTL response generated from unfractionated murine thymocytes in the presence of concanavalin A plus IL-2 correlated with production of IL-6 by cells within the thymic population. These data suggest that the generation of a CTL response in the absence of added IL-6 is due to the production of this ubiquitous lymphokine by thymocytes on in vitro culture. We present this as further evidence that IL-6 is necessary for the development of functional CTL from murine thymocytes and may therefore play a role in the development of effective tumor immunotherapy.\r"

We studied the effects of bolus IL-2 infusion on lung and soft-tissue transvascular fluid and protein filtration in six sheep with chronic lung and soft-tissue lymphatic cannulation. Changes in lung (QL) and soft-tissue (QS) lymph flow were used as indicators of transvascular fluid filtration. A dose of 100,000 U/kg IL-2 was administered every 8 hours for 3 days. A significant increase (p less than or equal to 0.05) in both QL and QS was observed after each IL-2 infusion, with maximal flow occurring 2 to 3 hours after infusion. After 72 hours of IL-2 infusion, a fourfold maximal increase in QL occurred, which recovered to near-baseline values within 24 hours. Elevations in QL and QS were not associated with increases in pulmonary arterial or pulmonary arterial wedge pressures, but these elevations were associated with significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) increases in cardiac output (7.7 +/- 0.5 to 11.4 +/- 0.4 L/min) and a consistent decrease in systemic vascular resistance. A significant increase in lung lymph/plasma protein ratio (0.49 +/- 0.06 to 0.93 +/- 0.04 for albumin) revealed a marked increase in pulmonary microvascular porosity. This change, however, was not observed in the systemic microcirculation. Serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor did not increase with the observed changes in pulmonary microvascular porosity. We conclude that IL-2 increases both pulmonary and systemic microvascular fluid flux. In addition, there is a marked increase in pulmonary, but not systemic, protein permeability that is not a consequence of changes mediated by tumor necrosis factor.\r"

All four groups had a similar percentage of lymphocytes, significantly higher than that of a control group of 15 healthy volunteers. A significant increase in the percentage of neutrophils was observed in groups 2, 3, and 4. The lavage fluid differential cell count does not therefore appear to help in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary infections in HIV positive patients. The abnormal percentage of lymphocytes observed in some patients with the AIDS related complex without clinical evidence of pulmonary infection suggests that lung injury may exist before clinical or radiological abnormalities develop. This might be related to an immunological mechanism or might be caused by an undetected subclinical infection.\r"

The present study investigates the kinetics of expression of Ia antigens on endothelial cells of rat vein autografts and allografts. The superficial epigastric veins of 15 ACI rats were anastomosed to the femoral artery of Lewis recipients using standard microsurgical technique. Eighteen Lewis-to-Lewis or ACI-to-ACI autografts served as controls. Veins were studied for Ia expression at 1, 4, and 7 days after grafting using the immunogold electron microscopic technique. All grafts remained patent for the duration of the experiment. Endothelial cells from control grafts did not demonstrate labeling of Ia antigens on their cell surfaces. Similarly, few mononuclear-adventitial cells in control grafts were Ia positive. When endothelial cells from vein allografts were studies for Ia antigen expression, 40% of the endothelial cells showed labeling for Ia at 4 days after transplantation. At 1 week following grafting, endothelial survival was inadequate for study because of cell loss secondary to rejection. In comparison to autografts, rejecting vein allografts showed numerous Ia-positive mononuclear cells permeating the vessel adventitia. Expression of Ia antigens by vascular endothelium may enable these cells to perform tasks traditionally ascribed to monocytes or dendritic cells. Effort to alter Ia expression may suggest an approach to long-term vein allograft survival.\r"

The 495 students who completed the questionnaire were representative of the 835 pharmacy students enrolled in this \"0/5\" undergraduate pharmacy program. The survey results indicated that honesty and full disclosure are preferences held by preprofessional students, whereas what may be described as professional judgment predominates in students during their final two professional years. Most students felt they had an idealistic or humanistic orientation. The differences among the classes may be due to any of a number of factors including curricula, normal maturation, or chance differences in the students within each class.\r"

  ".W": "19-Nor-deoxycorticosterone (19-nor-DOC) is a mineralocorticoid that is increased in some forms of experimental and human hypertension. The pivotal step in 19-nor-DOC biosynthesis is adrenal P450 19-hydroxylase, but this enzyme has not been clearly distinguished from P450 11 beta/18-hydroxylase. This study attempted to specifically inhibit adrenal 19-hydroxylation of deoxycorticosterone (DOC) using a suicide aromatase inhibitor, 19-acetylenic androstenedione (19-AA). Purified bovine P450 11 beta/18/19-hydroxylase was incubated with excess substrate DOC, adrenodoxin, and adrenodoxin reductase in the presence of increasing doses of the inhibitor, 19AA. 11 beta-, 18-, and 19-hydroxylation were measured by quantification of corticosterone, 18-OH-DOC, and 19-OH-DOC respectively. Measurements of these products demonstrated that 11 beta- and 18-hydroxylation was not inhibited whereas 19-hydroxylation was inhibited as manifested by decreased 19-OH-DOC formation (p less than .05). The IC50 of 19-AA was approximately 10(-12) M. The specific inhibition of 19-hydroxylation suggests that the 19-hydroxylase may be an enzyme distinct from the P450 11 beta/18-hydroxylase. This further suggests that 19-nor-DOC biosynthesis may be under independent regulation and may be amendable to specific in vivo inhibition.\r"

Trophoblastic fluid at different days of culture consistently inhibited the blast transformation of allogenic lymphocytes. This suppressor effect had no apparent correlation with biosynthesis of human chorionic gonadotropin by trophoblast cells, since this hormone was secreted into the culture fluid only for the initial 3 days. However, the culture fluids of such purified trophoblast cells contained an immunosuppressive factor, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, which was measurable throughout the culture period of 8 days. The presence of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A in significant amounts in trophoblastic fluid collected at daily intervals indicated a continuous secretion ability of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A by trophoblast cells in culture parallel to the suppressive immunoregulatory effect of the fluid. Such immunosuppressive effect was absent in the culture fluids of control BeWo malignant trophoblast cells; the BeWo cell culture fluids had markedly reduced levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A. The culture supernatant of normal trophoblast cells of placentas from first-trimester pregnancy activated in vitro the generation of a population of suppressor lymphocytes. This effect is generally considered responsible for immunologic tolerance. Therefore demonstration of immunosuppressive effects and the presence of relatively high levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A in trophoblastic fluid indicate that such proteins secreted by the trophoblast cells may be important in the local immunoregulatory processes of the fetal allograft.\r"

These 29 met our criteria of a minimum of 1 year on TAO-MP and at least 6 to 12 months on daily or alternate-day corticosteroids before TAO-MP was instituted. Charts were reviewed for nine known corticosteroid (CS) side effects, all previously identified side effects were excluded. Charts were also reviewed for TAO dose, MP dose, and dose/duration on CS therapy before TAO-MP regimen began. Patients on TAO at an average dose of 250 mg/d were able to wean to an average MP dose of 10.8 mg every other day from an average MP equivalent dose of 16.8 mg every other day before TAO. In spite of lower MP doses on TAO we found that 35% showed an increase in CS-induced side effects, some (three) had more than one side effect. Three patients developed cataracts (10%), two become hypertensive (6.8%), one developed diabetes (3%), one had a psychotic episode (3%), and one patient developed TB (3%) and had a spinal compression fracture. Sixty percent of these patients were on 8 mg or less of MP on an alternate-day basis. We found that in this group of 29 chronic steroid-dependent asthmatics the incidence of corticosteroid-related side effects was increased on TAO-MP regimens despite a reduction in corticosteroid dose.\r"

It was demonstrated that stimulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) (either by direct injection or by ingestion of antigen) followed by local administration of antigen into the bronchus was required to enhance clearance in this model. The primary effect of GALT immunization persisted for at least 6 wk; it was specific and could not be replaced by systemic immunization. Failure to stimulate locally in the bronchus was associated with protracted clearance. No clear correlation between local or systemic antibody and bacterial clearance was demonstrated; however, immunized rats were shown to have faster recruitment of phagocytic cells to the bronchial spaces, and these phagocytes had a higher activity state than cells harvested from nonimmunized animals. It is probable that bacterial clearance is accelerated in immunized animals due in part to factors mediating a change in the behavior of luminal phagocytes.\r"

The amount of IL-1 released from LPS-stimulated AM from smokers was significantly decreased compared with that in nonsmokers in both normal and sarcoid groups. The addition of indomethacin to the cultures in 18 normal subjects and in 22 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis yielded similar results, thus excluding the possibility that this difference resulted from a difference in the amount of cyclooxygenase metabolites released in the culture supernatants. Similar results were obtained by enzyme-linked immunosolvent assay. Because IL-1 is thought to induce the accumulation of T cells at the site of disease and contribute to local cellular and humoral immunity of the lung, our data suggest that the reduced capacity of AM to release IL-1 in smokers affords partial protection against the initiation of immune responses in the lung and the development of granulomatous lung diseases.\r"

To determine degradation of newly synthesized collagen, the appearance of hydroxy-[14C]proline, either free or in low-molecular-weight peptides, was compared with hydroxy-[14C]proline in protein. Fractional collagen synthesis rates decreased from 13.51 +/- 0.54%/day at 1 month to 0.97 +/- 0.14%/day at 2 yr of age (p less than 0.05). Total lung collagen production also fell, but only after 15 months, when it decreased from 2.01 +/- 0.16 mg/day at 15 months to 0.54 +/- 0.10 mg/day at 2 yr of age (p less than 0.05). Fractional rates of total collagen degradation, calculated from the difference between rates of synthesis and rates of collagen deposition, decreased 20-fold from 1 month to 2 yr of age. The proportion of newly synthesized collagen degraded increased from 27.6 +/- 3.2% at 1 month to a maximum of 82.3 +/- 1.1% at 15 months. These results suggest that lung collagen synthesis and degradation occur throughout life, and that degradative pathways may play important roles in regulating collagen production during growth and ageing.\r"

Although it is traditionally described as a childhood infection, recent reports describe an increased recognition of this problem in adults. When appropriate and timely therapy is instituted, this condition is generally self-limited. Recurrent acute epiglottitis is exceedingly uncommon, and its treatment rarely is addressed. We encountered and treated a case of recurrent acute epiglottitis in an adult. After the third recurrence, careful consideration was given to possible pathophysiologic mechanisms and potential therapeutic options. Further recurrence was prevented effectively by performing a lingual tonsillectomy. Although this is an unusual condition, the cause of recurrent acute epiglottitis may be related to chronic lingual tonsillitis. Lingual tonsillectomy in these cases may help prevent further recurrent episodes.\r"

Cultures infected with virus for 2 h were treated with clinically achievable concentrations of AZT, ddC, or a 3-day-alternating regimen of AZT and ddC. Media were completely changed every 3 days and replaced with antiviral agent, and virus production was assayed by p24 antigen and virus-specific DNA. Cells treated with no antiviral agent exhibited breakthrough infection by day 6 in culture, whereas cells treated with 0.1, 1.0, or 3.0 microM AZT had a prolonged time to viral breakthrough. For each regimen of AZT alternating with 0.05 or 0.1 microM ddC, there was consistently prolonged HIV inhibition compared with continuous treatment with AZT alone. The viral suppression achieved with the alternating combinations required AZT as well as ddC and was superior to 3 days of treatment with ddC alternating with 3 days of no antiretroviral treatment. Levels of unintegrated HIV DNA paralleled the detection of p24 antigen, with the most prolonged inhibition of virus-specific DNA occurring with AZT alternating with ddC (compared with all regimens except continuous treatment with ddC). These data suggest that alternating regimens of AZT and ddC not only might decrease toxicity associated with the two drugs but may prove to be more efficacious than AZT alone.\r"

Advanced age markedly reduced the 10-year and 15-year survival. When compared with the general population, however, the survival of patients in the older age groups (over 60 years) exceeded that of the general population at 10 and 15 years. In patients under 55 years of age, the 10-year and 15-year survival is less than that of the general population. Male and female patients of comparable ages had virtually identical 10-year and 15-year survival rates. Severe left ventricular dysfunction, previous coronary bypass operation, and diffuse coronary artery disease requiring coronary artery endarterectomy all adversely affected the long-term survival rates. Within all age groups studied there was a significant benefit in survival with either one or more mammary artery bypass grafts. The data presented provide an important historical control group that can be used in evaluating the long-term results after successful coronary bypass operations.\r"

The low incidence of renal dysfunction with modern techniques of bypass led us to reexamine this concept by monitoring urine output and creatinine clearance in 18 adult patients undergoing nonpulsatile, hemodilution cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary artery bypass grafting (12 patients) or valve procedures (6 patients). Samples were taken before, during (mean duration of bypass, 105 +/- 26 minutes [+/- standard deviation]), and every two hours after bypass for 24 hours. Urine output (42 +/- 37.7 mL/h) and creatinine clearance (57 +/- 40.4 mL/min) were surprisingly low in the period before cardiopulmonary bypass (all values normalized to a body surface area of 1.73 m2). Urine volumes rose to 305 +/- 149.6 mL/h and creatinine clearance to 252 +/- 176.9 mL/min during bypass and decreased to stable values after eight hours in the postoperative unit (urine output, approximately 60 mL/h, and creatinine clearance, approximately 75 mL/min). Renal dysfunction did not develop in any patient. Nine patients who required loop diuretics for low urine output 18 hours postoperatively had a sustained increase in both urine output and creatinine clearance lasting up to six hours. We conclude the following: modern techniques of cardiopulmonary bypass are not injurious to renal function; urine output and creatinine clearance are decreased before cardiopulmonary bypass, probably because of preoperative dehydration; and loop diuretics in the postoperative period increase both urine output and creatinine clearance for as long as six hours after administration.\r"

Patients with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia rarely respond to revascularization, but the response of patients with ventricular fibrillation as their basic arrhythmia has not been characterized. Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 8 patients with a history of cardiac arrest known to be caused by ventricular fibrillation without preceding sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. All patients had critical double-vessel or triple-vessel coronary artery disease, and 7 of 8 had wall motion abnormalities from a prior myocardial infarction. After successful operation, 5 patients had no spontaneous arrhythmias and no inducible arrhythmias at a postoperative electrophysiological study. Three patients, however, had spontaneous, recurrent episodes of ventricular fibrillation unassociated with recurrent ischemia. Clinical factors were not useful predictors of response. The effect of coronary artery revascularization in patients with ventricular fibrillation is unpredictable, and full postoperative electrophysiological evaluation is necessary to judge the success of the procedure.\r"

The average number of additional saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) per patient was 1.8. During the same period, 1,753 patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting using an SVG (average number of grafts per patient, 3.2). The average patient age was similar: 62.3 years for IMA grafts and 64.7 years for SVGs. Men constituted two thirds of each group. Left ventricular function was impaired (ejection fraction less than 45%) in 1,071 (51%) of IMA grafts and 847 (48.3%) of SVGs. Other aggregate risk factors, ie, elevated blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, previous myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure, were similar in each group. Operative results and postoperative mortality of the IMA and SVG patients were comparable. However, the long-term probability of cumulative survival and occlusion-free survival were significantly greater and the probability of recurrent angina and reoperative coronary artery bypass grafting were significantly less in IMA graft patients (p less than 0.015). The relative risk of occlusion in an SVG was 4 to 5 times greater than that of the IMA graft. These data indicate that a patent IMA graft to the anterior descending coronary artery protects against recurrent angina and death from cardiac-related causes, and that the IMA should be the conduit of choice.\r"

There were 15 early deaths (2.3%). The mortality rate was higher (7.8%) for multiple-vessel endarterectomy (p less than 0.05). The ratio of MB fraction of creatine kinase to total creatine kinase was greater than or equal to 0.10 in 48% of the cases. The first consecutive 132 survivors were followed for an average of 16 months (range, 4 months to 5 years). No late deaths occurred. Fifty-nine unselected patients underwent postoperative recatheterization at a mean interval of 18 months. An improvement in heart wall contractility could be detected in 13 patients (16.5%) and deterioration in 14 patients (17.7%). A more detailed analysis of wall contractility showed a higher rate of improvement in the posterior wall than in the anterior wall (p greater than 0.05). Furthermore, the better the contractility before operation, the greater the rate of deterioration after operation (p less than 0.05). Despite an average of 55% of all endarterectomized vessels being occluded or severely restenosed, 90% of the patients were clinically improved. A multiparametric analysis revealed that the revascularization of myocardial areas that required endarterectomy had no significant influence with respect to clinical improvement. Endarterectomy should be limited, whenever possible, to myocardial areas with already impaired contractility. Endarterectomy of multiple branches should be treated with caution because the risk of deterioration is potentiated, with a significantly higher perioperative mortality rate.\r"

The mean age was 45 +/- 3 years (range, 19 to 74 years). Patients underwent left ventriculography at an average of 15 +/- 3 months postoperatively (range, 1 to 78 months). Severity of mitral regurgitation was evaluated by two teams of reviewers. Mitral regurgitation due to catheter entrapment or to premature ventricular contraction or other arrhythmia was excluded. Overall, 51% of patients showed improvement in the severity of mitral regurgitation, and all those with more severe mitral regurgitation (ie, 3+) demonstrated improvement. The population was subdivided for analysis into those with coronary artery disease requiring bypass grafting at the time of left ventricular septal myectomy (n = 7, 20%) and those without coronary artery bypass grafting. Among the 7 patients undergoing bypass grafting, 71% demonstrated improvement in the degree of mitral regurgitation as compared with only 46% of those without bypass grafting (p less than 0.005 by X2 analysis). Significant reductions in peak gradients at rest and in response to provocation, and in New York Heart Association functional class, also occurred in both groups.\r"

  ".W": "Four lines of transgenic mice containing the HIV LTR linked to the bacterial gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) were constructed. In each line, a characteristic tissue pattern of CAT expression was observed with detectable levels present in the eye, heart, spleen, thymus, and tail. Low levels of CAT were present in circulating lymphocytes, but CAT activity in these cells could be augmented following treatment with the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Likewise, CAT expression was present at only low levels in circulating monocytes, but higher levels of CAT were observed in macrophages grown in the presence of various cytokines (CSF-1, GM-CSF, IL-1 alpha, IL-4, and IL-2). Furthermore, Langerhans cells recovered from skin showed higher levels of CAT activity than those observed in other cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage. These results indicate that LTR-CAT expression in cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage may increase in proportion to the degree of differentiation of these cells. These animals may be useful in the study of cell-specific determinants of LTR-directed gene activity and may serve to identify exogenous cofactors that promote the progression of HIV-related disease in vivo.\r"

Deletion of the C-terminal 76 amino acids did not abolish production of reverse transcriptase upon transfection of COS-1 cells. Deletion of the C-terminal 6-14 amino acids appeared sufficient to alter the replication pattern, infectivity, and cytopathogenicity of some clones. The data suggest that conformational determinants or specific sequences are responsible for the observed changes, rather than simply the length of the gp41 cytoplasmic tail.\r"

Circular dichroism spectra showed evidence of alpha helical conformation when the peptides were dissolved in the nonpolar solvent trifuoroethanol. These two regions are indeed exposed on the molecule because they were accessible to their respective specific antibodies on the native gp160 precursor or processed gp120 glycoproteins of HIV-1. Neither the peptides nor rabbit or human antibodies directed against the N- and C-terminal peptides interfered with the interaction between HIV-1 external glycoprotein gp120 and its CD4 cellular receptor. Taken together, these results indicate that N- and C-terminal regions of gp120 are accessible on the quaternary structure of the virion as well as on the soluble form of gp120 and that these regions are not directly or indirectly involved in the binding of gp120 to CD4.\r"

Experiments were performed on chloralose anaesthetized dogs in which all neurogenic cardiovascular reflexes were abolished by bilateral vagotomy and common carotid ligatures, in combination with i.v. bretylium and propranolol. Bolus doses of propofol followed by infusions at rates up to 160 mg kg-1 h-1 produced blood concentrations of propofol from 1.99 to 112 micrograms ml-1. Infusions of hydroxyethyl starch given to maintain central venous pressures and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures at control values were used as an index of changes in capacitance. Blood concentrations of propofol less than 10 micrograms ml-1 caused an increase in mean capacitance of 8.0 (SEM 1) ml kg-1 with no significant changes in systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance or inotropic state of the heart. We conclude that anaesthesia with propofol may be accompanied by decreased cardiac output secondary to reduction in preload by a direct venodilator effect. Our experiments indicate that cardiac output and arterial pressure are preserved well at normal anaesthetic blood concentrations of propofol if the preload is maintained.\r"

Case-control studies have shown that high parity and oral contraceptive use are protective against the disease. We suggest that the decrease in mortality is compatible in timing and magnitude with exposure to oral contraceptives. No obvious effect on mortality attributable to parity was apparent in this analysis. Oral contraceptives may prove to be a widely acceptable means of preventing ovarian cancer, providing they do not increase breast cancer risk.\r"

The patients comprise two groups: between 1964 and 1974, 126 patients were treated but were not systematically stratified using a prognostic score before the start of treatment. These patients formed part of the 317 women who were analysed to identify a number of prognostic variables (Bagshawe 1976). Retrospective analysis of these 126 patients using these prognostic factors showed that in the true low-risk group 85/88 (96%) are alive while 20/22 (91%) of the medium-risk group and only 5/16 (31%) of the high-risk group are alive. Overall the survival was 110/126 (87%) with a minimum follow-up of 14 years. From 1974 all patients were stratified on admission into prognostic groups. Of the true low-risk patients 347/348 survived (99.7%); 13 patients were underscored and treated as low risk when they should have been treated as medium risk, 12 (92%) of these are alive, but nine (69%) needed to change treatment because of drug resistance. While the overall survival in the 1974-1986 group was 359/361 (99%) with a minimum follow-up of 16 months, the survival in all patients (1964-1986) was 469/487 (96%). Although the survival in these patients is excellent it should be noted that 69/348 (20%) low-risk patients had to change treatment because of the development of drug resistance, and a further 23 (6%) needed to change treatment because of drug-induced toxicity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

By analysing pregnancy and non-pregnancy serum with two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and Western blotting, we could demonstrate that this antiserum marketed by Dakopatts (Denmark) was capable of binding haptoglobin whereas our own (Dr P. Bischof) antibody preparation did not recognize haptoglobin.\r"

Because the presence of PAPP-A in non-pregnant females is controversial, we re-evaluated our own radioimmunoassay technique for PAPP-A in the light of new observations about its immunological heterogeneity. Irrespective of the antibody (Geneva anti-PAPP-A or Dako anti-PAPP-A) the use of EDTA pregnancy plasma instead of pregnancy serum as a standard yielded different slopes of the standard curves and estimated significantly different amounts of PAPP-A in test samples. Moreover, highly purified tracers, isolated from maternal EDTA pregnancy plasma or pregnancy serum also produced significantly different results. So that the use of a tracer purified from EDTA plasma and EDTA pregnancy plasma as a standard will yield measurable levels of PAPP-A in non-pregnant female serum whereas the use of a tracer purified from maternal pregnancy serum and maternal pregnancy serum as a standard will not detect PAPP-A in the same samples. We conclude that, irrespective of the antiserum used, but depending on the biological origin of the tracer and the standard, different results will be obtained. PAPP-A is clearly immunologically heterogeneous, and the immunorecognition of PAPP-A will depend on whether or not blood coagulation has taken place.\r"

In agreement with previously reported data, the tetrapeptide consisting of the RGDS sequence was a more potent inhibitor of plasma-vWf binding to platelets than was the pentadecapeptide of the carboxy terminus of the fibrinogen gamma-chain (IC50 10.6 mumol/L for the RGDS tetrapeptide v 44.9 mumol/L for the gamma-chain pentadecapeptide). No apparent synergy in the inhibition of plasma-vWf binding was noted when the RGDS and gamma-chain peptides were used together (IC50 15.2 mumol/L). In contrast, the gamma-chain peptide was significantly more inhibitory than was the RGDS tetrapeptide on the binding of platelet-vWf to platelets (IC50 1.4 mumol/L for the gamma-chain pentadecapeptide v 4.5 mumol/L for the RGDS tetrapeptide, P less than .05), and there was significant synergy in the inhibition of platelet-vWf binding noted when the gamma-chain and RGDS peptides were used together (IC50 0.04 mumol/L). These results indicate that the binding of platelet-vWf to its receptor on the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex involves both the RGDS and gamma-chain recognition sites. In contrast to the results with plasma-vWf binding, the gamma-chain recognition site appears to be more important than the RGDS recognition site in platelet-vWf binding to platelets.\r"

A dose-response experiment showed that IL-6 increased platelet counts in a dose-dependent fashion at a plateau stimulation level of 5 micrograms. Administration of 5 micrograms of IL-6 reproducibly elevated platelet counts at five days by approximately 50% to 60% of increase. Moreover, a striking increase in megakaryocytic size in response to IL-6 was elicited by the treatment, but no change in megakaryocyte numbers; whereas IL-6 administration did not expand CFU-MK numbers. The in vivo studies in this manner had negligible effects on other hematologic parameters, with the minor exception of monocyte levels. These data show that IL-6 acts on maturational stages in megakaryocytopoiesis and promotes platelet production in vivo in mice, suggesting that IL-6 functions as thrombopoietin.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of class II MHC and CD34 antigens on human cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) was investigated upon culturing in the presence of interleukin-3 (IL-3). HPC isolated by \"panning\" according to their expression of CD34 coexpressed HLA-DR and HLA-DP, and the majority of the CD34+ HPC also expressed HLA-DQ. In the presence of IL-3, the expression of CD34 and class II MHC antigens was found to be gradually lost in culture. Loss of CD34 expression preceded loss of HLA-DR expression. After eight days of culture, CD34-, HLA-DR+ blast cells were obtained that strongly proliferated in response to IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and M-CSF, and that had the capacity to generate macrophage and granulocyte colonies. After ten days of culture in IL-3, a population of CD34- cells that expressed low levels of HLA-DR (HLA-DRlo) was obtained by FACS-sorting. These CD34-, HLA-DRlo cells lacked colony-forming activity while the population expressing high levels of HLA-DR (HLA-DRhi) contained great numbers of colony-forming cells, and proliferated stronger in response to CSFs than the HLA-DRlo fraction. Finally CD34-, HLA-DR- cells that appeared later in the cultures (14 to 16 days) represented more differentiated cells with only marginal proliferative and no clonogenic capacity. These data indicate that whereas CD34 expression is associated with the multilineage potential of the HPC, HLA-DR expression correlates with overall proliferative capacity of hematopoietic cells during culture in IL-3.\r"

  ".W": "The receptors for fibronectin (FN-R) and vitronectin (VN-R) belong to a family of integral membrane glycoproteins known to be involved in cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions named integrins (FN-R = beta 1 integrin and VN-R = beta 3 integrin). Adhesion studies using FN-coated plastic dishes and highly purified subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed a strong binding of monocytes and T lymphocytes to FN but virtually no binding of B cells to FN. Binding of monocytes and T cells to FN could be partially inhibited by a hexapeptide (GRGDSP) containing the adhesive peptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) as well as by an anti-FN-R antibody. The distribution of beta 1 and beta 3 integrin complexes on PBMCs was characterized by immunoprecipitation of detergent extracts of 125I-labeled cells using polyclonal antibodies against these two receptors. Two surface polypeptides corresponding to the alpha and beta chains of FN-R and VN-R were found on all three cell types. To characterize these receptors further, monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against the very late antigens (VLAs) 1, 3, and 5 were used for immunoprecipitation studies. Monocytes and T cells reacted with VLA 5 that was previously identified as the human FN receptor, whereas no labeling with anti-VLA 5 could be shown for B cells. When cell populations were cultured in 10% human serum for 24 hours, an increase in beta 1-integrin+ monocytes and T cells was observed. The number of beta 3-integrin+ cells remained essentially unchanged. The presence of beta 1 and beta 3 integrins on monocytes as well as on T and B lymphocytes may be of significance in the ability of these cells to interact with each other and participate in hematopoiesis and certain immune reactions.\r"

Ficoll-Hypaque (FH)-separated BM cells were obtained from patients with active disease (at diagnosis N = 13, in relapse N = 15) and in complete remission (CR; N = 12). CD3+ cells were removed by Leu-4 antibody and immunobeads. Cells were cultured (10(5) cells/mL) in semisolid media with rIL-2 (100 mu/mL), LMW-BCGF (0.1 mu/mL), and the combination of rIL-2 plus LMW-BCGF, respectively, for seven to ten days. Pooled colonies were harvested for phenotyping. LMW-BCGF plus rIL-2 induced large numbers of CD3+ colonies from CD3- precursors. rIL-2 alone did not induce colony formation. In addition, cells were cultured in liquid media with LMW-BCGF, rIL-2, and the combination of LMW-BCGF plus rIL-2, respectively, for seven to 21 days. They were harvested for phenotyping, and cytotoxicity assays were performed v K562, Raji, and autologous leukemic cells. LMW-BCGF plus rIL-2 induced significant expansion of CD3+ cells from CD3- precursors, and these cells were activated to kill autologous leukemic cells in addition to Raji and K562 cell lines. LMW-BCGF or rIL-2 alone did not induce significant expansion or activation of cytotoxic CD3- cells. Our hypothesis is that LMW-BCGF plus rIL-2 stimulates the proliferation and activation of CD3- precursors from the BM cells of children with acute leukemia to become CD3+ cells that have LAK activity. This finding may have therapeutic implications.\r"

  ".W": "Castleman's disease is a syndrome consisting of giant lymph node hyperplasia with plasma cell infiltration, fever, anemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and an increase in the plasma level of acute phase proteins. It has been reported that clinical abnormalities disappear after the resection of the affected lymph nodes, suggesting that products of lymph nodes may cause such clinical abnormalities. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine inducing B-cell differentiation to immunoglobulin-producing cells and regulating biosynthesis of acute phase proteins. This report demonstrates that the germinal centers of hyperplastic lymph nodes of patients with Castleman's disease produce large quantities of IL-6 without any significant production of other cytokines. In a patient with a solitary hyperplastic lymph node, clinical improvement and decrease in serum IL-6 were observed following surgical removal of the involved lymph node. There was a correlation between serum IL-6 level, lymph node hyperplasia, hypergammaglobulinemia, increased level of acute phase proteins, and clinical abnormalities. The findings in this report indicate that the generation of IL-6 by B cells in germinal centers of hyperplastic lymph nodes of Castleman's disease may be the key element responsible for the variety of clinical symptoms in this disease.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of interleukin-7 (IL-7) to stimulate murine thymocyte proliferation was investigated. IL-7, either alone or in concert with lectin, induced proliferation of adult thymocytes as well as day 13 fetal and adult CD4-/CD8-thymocytes. The IL-7-induced proliferative response of unfractionated thymocytes could not be inhibited by antibodies to IL-2, or IL-4, IL-6, or the IL-2 receptor. In addition, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 were not produced by thymocytes activated with IL-7, as judged by the absence of biologically active cytokine in IL-7-stimulated culture supernatants. IL-7 could act in concert with IL-2 and IL-4 or with IL-4 to enhance the proliferative response of thymocyte cultures. Thus, IL-7 may cause proliferation of thymocytes directly, not indirectly, through production of IL-2, IL-4, or IL-6. IL-7 may then play a significant role in differentiation of T lymphocytes.\r"

We established a T-lymphoid cell line (CML-T1) from a person with Ph-chromosome-negative CML in acute phase. Evidence of its T-lymphocyte origin includes the pattern cytochemical reactivity, reactivity with anti-T-cell monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), and rearrangement of the beta-T-cell receptor (TCRB) gene. CML-T1 cells have features of type IV thymocytes. Cytogenetic analyses indicate a 47,XX, del(11), t(6;7)(q23;q24), +mar karyotype. CML-T1 cells exhibit molecular changes typical of CML, including translocation of the ABL protooncogene from chromosome 9 to 22, rearrangement of the BCR gene, and transcription of a chimeric BCR-ABL messenger RNA (mRNA). The ABL insertion on chromosome 22 appears interstitial, similar to other cases of Ph-chromosome-negative CML. These data clearly indicate that T cells can be involved in acute-phase CML. CML-T1 should be useful in studying this process as well as that underlying Ph-chromosome-negative CML.\r"

Receptor-bound u-PA is catalytically twice as efficient as fluid-phase u-PA. Fluid-phase u-PA is susceptible to rapid inhibition by PAI-1 and PAI-2 at an estimated PAI:u-PA molar ratio of 2:1. In contrast, u-PA bound to endogenously occupied receptors is inhibited by PAI-2 only at PAI:u-PA molar ratios of 20:1, but is not inhibited by PAI-1, u-PA/PAI-1 and u-PA/PAI-2 complexes bind to the receptor with a tenfold lower affinity than u-PA itself. Thus, competition of u-PA/PAI complexes with fluid-phase u-PA for binding to the receptor is unlikely to affect the overall plasminogen activator activity of the monocyte. These findings demonstrate that the activity of receptor-bound u-PA can be modulated by PAI-2, but not by PAI-1, to adjust the cell's proteolytic activity to different local situations.\r"

However, a chronic injection sclerotherapy programme with rigid oesophagoscopy under general anaesthesia commenced only in 1979. So far, 82 patients have entered the programme; 57 patients had already received 73 acute injections before commencing chronic sclerotherapy. Subsequently, the 82 patients received 221 chronic injections plus a further 29 acute injections for rebleeding episodes which occurred during the programme. There were 24 Child's grade A patients, 23 B and 35 C; 48 per cent had alcoholic cirrhosis. Forty-eight patients achieved variceal obliteration with a mean of four injections. During the programme 24 patients experienced 42 acute bleeds. There were only two bleeding episodes within 1 week of a chronic injection and eight within 4 weeks. In the 8-year period there have been four early deaths. One occurred 17 days after a chronic injection and three followed acute injections required for rebleeding during the programme. There were 21 late deaths, mostly due to progressive liver failure, and none from rebleeding. We conclude that chronic injection sclerotherapy using rigid oesophagoscopy under general anaesthesia is both safe and effective.\r"

Adoptive immunotherapy treatment with interleukin-2 (IL-2) was carried out for 13 patients with malignant melanoma; eight with metastatic renal cell carcinoma; and three with metastatic colon cancer. The authors estimated total biopterins in plasma and lymphokine (IL-2)-activated killer cells (LAK) from these patients before and during various treatment phases to determine if increased biopterins production reflects leukocyte activation by IL-2 or antitumor activity. They noted an increased synthesis of total \"biopterins,\" i.e., biopterin; 7,8-dehydrobiopterin; and L-neopterin in LAK cells and plasma which correlated with IL-2 exposure. Mean plasma biopterins were normal (1.2 +/- 0.5 ng/ml) before therapy; in contrast, biopterins increased significantly to 3.4 +/- 1.9 ng/ml and 3.9 +/- 1.9 ng/ml during IL-2 and IL-2 + LAK treatment each, respectively. Similar biopterin elevations were noted irrespective of the different adoptive immunotherapy protocols used. Elevated biopterins decreased to normal levels (1.2 +/- 0.7 ng/ml) when IL-2 treatment was omitted. Tumor regression with adoptive immunotherapy did not correlate with increased plasma biopterins. Increased biopterins production was also associated with increase in plasma catecholamine after IL-2 treatment during adoptive immunotherapy. Conceivably increased biopterins, induced by IL-2 activation of a leukocyte population, is a cell-mediated consequence not necessarily serving as a signal for the antitumor effect associated with adoptive immunotherapy.\r"

In this study we have investigated the role of reduced thiol in the mechanism of action of endothelium-derived relaxing factor on platelets. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were grown on microcarrier beads and pretreated with aspirin before use. Endothelial cells stimulated with bradykinin or exposed to stirred medium expressed a dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation that was potentiated by the reduced thiol, N-acetylcysteine. Endothelial cell-mediated platelet inhibition was attenuated by methylene blue. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by endothelial cells was associated with a rise in platelet intracellular cyclic GMP, an effect that was enhanced by N-acetylcysteine. These data show that 1) the reduced thiol N-acetylcysteine potentiates platelet inhibition by endothelium-derived relaxing factor and 2) this effect is associated with increasing intracellular platelet cyclic GMP levels.\r"

  ".W": "Complement is activated, and C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins are generated during hypersensitivity reactions clinically associated with cardiopulmonary collapse. The administration of C3a or C5a to nonsensitized isolated guinea pig hearts mimics the events caused by antigen challenge of sensitized hearts (i.e., cardiac anaphylaxis) in the absence of complement. Thus, complement-derived anaphylatoxins may participate in immediate hypersensitivity reactions in which the heart is a target organ. To assess the contribution of complement activation and anaphylatoxin generation to cardiac dysfunction, we have elicited anaphylaxis in isolated guinea pig hearts in the presence of complement and found that the ensuing dysfunction is markedly enhanced. This amplification is most likely attributable to anaphylatoxin formation because 1) inactivation of C3 or selective C3 depletion, i.e., the loss of the component responsible for the formation of the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, prevents complement-induced exacerbation of cardiac anaphylaxis, whereas reconstitution with C3 and C5, or even only C3, restores it; in fact, the greater the C3 content at the time of antigen challenge, the more intense the anaphylactic crisis; and 2) the severity of cardiac anaphylaxis is markedly reduced by preexposure to C3a, and this reduction is directly related to the dose of C3a injected and to the amount of endogenous cardiac histamine depleted by C3a before antigen challenge. Complement-derived anaphylatoxins appear to promote the same mediator release that has been initiated by the antigen-antibody reaction; thus, complement activation functions as an amplification system in cardiac anaphylaxis.\r"

  ".W": "In 1,801 patients in the 1985-1986 Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty Registry, overall 1-year mortality was 3.2%, the 1-year myocardial infarction rate was 7.2%, and the 1-year coronary artery bypass surgery rate was 13.2%. In the 78% of the cohort with all lesions successfully dilated and without major procedural complications (successful patients), the corresponding rates were 1.9%, 2.6%, and 6.4%. Nearly 20% of all deaths, 40% of all infarctions, and 25% of all bypass operations occurred in the small subset of patients (6.8%) who sustained periprocedural occlusion. Event rates were higher in patients with multivessel disease than in those with one-vessel disease. At 1 year, angina-free status was reported by approximately three fourths of all surviving patients, regardless of initial success. However, compared with successful patients, unsuccessful patients underwent intervening bypass surgery (42% vs. 6%) to achieve asymptomatic status more frequently. Comparison of the 1-year event rates in the 1985-1986 registry with those in the 1977-1981 registry indicated reductions in all major untoward events. These reductions became apparent after controlling for the more extensive disease of the 1985-1986 registry patients. In contrast, use of repeat angioplasty has increased by 50%. We conclude that the improved initial results reported in the 1985-1986 registry cohort were maintained at 1-year follow-up.\r"

Thirty-four patients had coronary stenosis 90% or greater on angiograms. Side effects resulting from systemic vasodilation were observed in about 70%. Angina pectoris and ischemic ST changes were observed only in patients with coronary stenosis. These symptoms disappeared after aminophylline infusion. Results of visual and quantitative analysis of SPECT were compared. SPECT data were shown on two-dimensional polar maps, and the extent and severity scores were calculated. The sensitivity of SPECT for detection of overall coronary stenosis was 91% (visual analysis) and 88% (quantitative analysis). The specificity of SPECT was 60% visually and 93% quantitatively. The sensitivity of quantitative analysis to detect individual coronary stenosis was similar to that of visual analysis. However, the specificity of visual analysis to detect individual coronary artery stenosis was significantly less than that of quantitative analysis. From these data, we conclude that quantitative analysis of myocardial SPECT after dipyridamole infusion is a safe and accurate diagnostic method for identifying coronary stenosis in children with Kawasaki disease.\r"

The internal mammary artery graft was concomitantly used in all patients. The mean number of grafts per patient was 3.0 (range, 2-4). Preoperative exercise testing could not be performed in two patients because of emergency operation. By qualitative assessment with the polar-coordinate map, four patients showed improvement, one did not show any change, and one became worse due to perioperative myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent advances in interventional cardiology have altered the profile of patients referred for coronary artery bypass surgery. In recent years, the proportion of high-risk patients has increased dramatically. To evaluate the impact of the changing pattern of surgical patients, we prospectively followed up 7,334 patients who had coronary artery bypass surgery between 1982 and 1986. Multivariate analysis identified the following risk factors for operative mortality: urgency of surgery, left ventricular ejection fraction, age, female sex, previous bypass surgery, and left main coronary artery stenosis. Perioperative mortality has remained stable despite an increasing incidence of high-risk patients. However, perioperative morbidity has increased, due to the large number of high-risk patients. A multivariate analysis was performed by year to identify temporal trends in risk factors. Urgency of surgery, age, and previous bypass surgery have become more significant predictors of mortality with respect to time, whereas female sex, left ventricular ejection fraction, and left main coronary artery stenosis have become less significant determinants of mortality. Our results demonstrate the critical dependence of mortality and morbidity rates on the case mix, and further improvements in the results of coronary artery bypass surgery will require better strategies for the increasing number of high-risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies from this university, advanced age was identified as an independent predictor of operative mortality for valvular surgery. Therefore, between January 1982 and December 1986, early results were compared in 469 patients greater than 70 years old (Old; 74.0 +/- 3.4 years, mean +/- SD) and in 2,040 patients less than 70 years old (Young; 53.7 +/- 12.1 years). Patients underwent single- or multiple-valve repair or replacement with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass surgery. Data consisting of 31 clinical and angiographic variables were collected prospectively and were analyzed by univariate and multivariate statistics. Old patients were characterized by having more frequent left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%: Old, 33.5%; Young, 22.4%; p less than 0.001), coronary artery disease (Old, 54.5%; Young, 24.2%; p less than 0.001), and urgent surgery (Old, 15.6%; Young, 11.8%; p = 0.02). Aortic valve procedures (Old, 59.7%; Young, 40.1%; p less than 0.001) and concomitant coronary artery bypass surgery (Old, 46.4%; Young, 20.3%; p less than 0.001) were performed more commonly in the Old patient. Operative mortality occurred in 10.0% of Old patients compared with 5.6% of Young patients (p less than 0.001), and major morbidity (low-output syndrome, perioperative myocardial infarction, intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation, and stroke) occurred significantly more frequently (p less than 0.001) in the Old. Stepwise logistic regression identified that urgent operation (p = 0.002), mitral or double-valve surgery (p = 0.004), coronary artery disease especially when not treated by bypass surgery (p = 0.02), female gender (p = 0.02), and left ventricular dysfunction (p = 0.05) independently predicted operative death in the Old population. The significant predictors of mortality in the Young patient were urgent operation (p less than 0.001), New York Heart Association class IV (p less than 0.001), associated tricuspid valve disease (p = 0.002), decreased left ventricular function (p = 0.01), valvular re-replacement (p = 0.02), and increasing age (p = 0.03). The predicted probability of operative mortality in Old patients ranged between 0.9 +/- 0.5% and 76 +/- 16%. Elderly patients in good risk categories should be offered surgical intervention for correction of valvular lesions. Alternative therapy may be indicated in patients with multiple risk factors.\r"

Data on women older than 49 years enrolled in a prepaid medical care program were analyzed to determine the incidence of hospitalization for hip fracture, in-hospital death rate, and five-year probability of survival after hip fracture. The cumulative lifetime probability of hip fracture for women alive at age 50 years was calculated, taking into account current estimates of survival in women. As in other studies, the incidence of hip fracture increased exponentially with age. In-hospital death rate after hip fracture was low in this population (3.7%). Survival after hip fracture was correlated with age at hospitalization. About 12% of women alive at age 50 years will be hospitalized for a hip fracture at least once before they die. In this population, the incidence of hospitalization, in-hospital death rate, and lifetime probability of hip fracture were lower than in some other reports.\r"

The present study describes the epidermal content of these mediators during an irritant patch test reaction. The results show that ELCF, but not ETAF/IL-1, is significantly increased in the epidermis of an irritant patch test with 3% SLS or 5% croton oil, irrespective of the intensity of the clinical patch test reaction. We observed that simple occlusion of epidermis did not induce ELCF activity in healthy persons, whereas patients with previous or current eczema had a significant release of ELCF following such occlusion. These results seem to indicate that there exist important functional differences between allergic and irritant patch test reactions with respect to the presence of lymphocyte activating signals in epidermis.\r"

Criteria included the following: 1) R-wave width greater than or equal to 0.04 s and R-wave greater than or equal to S-wave in V1; 2) R-wave greater than or equal to S-wave in V2; 3) T-wave voltage in V2 minus V6 greater than or equal to 0.38 mV (T-wave index); 4) Q-wave greater than or equal to 0.04 s in left paraspinal lead V9. Twenty-seven patients (7.3 percent) met thallium criteria for posterior myocardial infarction, defined as a persistent perfusion defect in the posterobase of the left ventricle. Sensitivities for the four criteria ranged from 4 to 56 percent, and specificities ranged from 64 to 99 percent. Posterior paraspinal lead V9 provided the best overall predictive accuracy (94 percent), positive predictive value (58 percent), and ability to differentiate patients with and without posterior myocardial infarction of any single criterion (p less than .0001). Combining the T-wave index with lead V9 further enhanced the diagnostic yield: the sensitivity for detecting posterior infarction by at least one of these criteria was 78 percent, and when both criteria were positive, specificity was 98.5 percent. It is concluded that a single, unipolar posterior lead in the V9 position is superior to standard 12-lead electrocardiographic criteria in diagnosing remote posterior myocardial infarction, and that combining V9 with the T-wave index maximizes the diagnostic yield.\r"

Sputum smears were negative for acid-fast bacilli and both bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy revealed only PCP. Repeat bronchoscopy one month later was unrevealing and marked x-ray resolution occurred after treatment with pentamidine alone. The incidence of atypical roentgenographic features of PCP in AIDS is approximately 10 percent. Given the frequency of this infection in AIDS, knowledge of the unusual presentations is imperative. Based on this report, PCP must be included in the differential diagnosis of a miliary x-ray pattern.\r"

The applications of this technique for the management of bleeding following endoscopic sphincterotomy have not been reported previously. Of five patients referred for arteriography with life-threatening postsphincterotomy bleeding, active bleeding from branches of the gastroduodenal artery was demonstrated in four. Embolization of this vessel with Gelfoam controlled the bleeding in all three patients in whom it was attempted. Arterial stenosis and spasm precluded such treatment in one patient. The fifth patient was not bleeding at the time of arteriography. There were no complications from these procedures. Our experience shows that postsphincterotomy bleeding can be safely and effectively controlled by transcatheter embolization, thereby avoiding surgery which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in this setting.\r"

Forty-three patients were followed from 5 to 68 months: cumulative survival was 97.7% and varices recurred in 16%. Sclerotherapy avoided a second operation in 21 postsurgical patients.

Although steroids have been useful in some patients, antrectomy has been advocated as definitive therapy. We have treated 12 patients who were bleeding from this lesion with the Olympus HeatProbe Unit and have eliminated further hemorrhage. All presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, iron-deficiency anemia, and compatible antral biopsies. Using the large probe, vascular streaks were treated until the endoscopic appearance returned to normal (average four treatment sessions). No further bleeding was evident from the antral vascular ectasia over an average follow-up period of 20.9 months. Eight of 10 patients who had required transfusion prior to therapy no longer needed transfusion, but two received blood for other conditions. We conclude that antral vascular ectasia can be successfully treated with the HeatProbe Unit and this should be the initial modality of therapy for this condition.\r"

The model describes the development of plasma cells and T-helper cells from their precursors through activated and proliferating cells. A state of autotolerance is simulated by reducing the rate of T precursors supply (partial clonal deletion theory), while the normal rate yields a stable state of autoimmunity. During the state of autoimmunity extra-corporeal removal of autoantibody and immunosuppression are simulated. Removal of auto-antibody alone results in stimulation of the immune system and quick return to the previous state, mainly on account of activation of memory cells. Antibody overshooting is negligible. Immunosuppression leads to a slow decline in the antibody level. Synergy is clearly demonstrated between both therapies.\r"

Biopsy specimens obtained from small skin nodules containing a dense infiltration of lymphocytes were analyzed by Southern blotting with the use of probes for both the beta-chain of the T-cell receptor gene and the ATLV/HTLV-I genome. DNA samples from one patient with early, chronic adult T cell lymphoma or leukemia, revealed the monoclonal proliferation of lymphocytes. For another patient with early cutaneous T cell lymphoma analysis by Southern blotting with the beta-chain probe of DNA from three separate lesions revealed identical rearranged bands, indicating not only the monoclonal proliferation of T cells in each lesion but also the clonal origin of each lesion. In contrast, analysis by Southern blotting of DNA samples extracted from three nodules from a patient with lymphomatoid papulosis showed no rearranged band and therefore no clonal proliferation. DNA extracted from blood lymphocytes of these patients failed to hybridize with the probes described above as a rearranged band. These results indicate that analysis of DNA extracted from skin lesions may have diagnostic value in determining monoclonal proliferation of lymphocytes in patients with early stage cutaneous lymphomas.\r"

  ".W": "Representative adult patient populations seeking treatment at a dental school in 1976 and 1986 were analyzed for the prevalence and the characteristics of medical conditions. Patients' records (N = 3,000) were randomly selected from the examination clinics and reviewed for the presence and types of compromising medical conditions. The results indicated a significant increase in the percentage of dental patients who had medical conditions in 1986 as compared with 1976 (P less than .001), as well as significant changes in the types of medical conditions present. These data indicate an increase in the number of patients with medical problems in the general dental school patient population.\r"

  ".W": "Noninvasive measurement of myocardial blood flow in absolute terms (i.e., milliliters per gram per min) has been difficult to accomplish despite the intrinsically quantitative power of positron emission tomography because of the nonphysiologic nature of tracers that have been employed conventionally as well as the limited spatial resolution of currently available instruments. It was previously demonstrated that myocardial blood flow in animals can be quantitated accurately with the diffusible tracer oxygen-15-labeled water (H2(15)O) when the arterial input function and myocardial radiotracer concentration were measured directly. To extend the approach for completely noninvasive measurement of blood flow, a parameter estimation procedure was developed whereby effects of limited tomographic spatial resolution and cardiac motion were compensated for within the operational flow model. In validation studies in 18 dogs, myocardial blood flow measured with positron emission tomography after intravenously administered H2(15)O correlated closely with flow measured with concomitantly administered radiolabeled microspheres over the range of 0.29 to 5.04 ml/g per min (r = 0.95). Although regional ischemia was clearly identifiable tomographically, absolute flow could not be determined accurately in ischemic regions in four dogs because of poor count statistics related to wall thinning. Subsequently, myocardial blood flow was measured in 11 normal human subjects. Flow was homogeneous throughout the myocardium, averaged 0.90 +/- 0.22 ml/g per min at rest and increased to 3.55 +/- 1.15 ml/g per min after intravenous administration of dipyridamole. Therefore, positron emission tomography with H2 15O and the approach developed permits noninvasive measurement of myocardial blood flow in absolute terms in humans and should facilitate objective assessment of interventions designed to enhance nutritive perfusion.\r"
