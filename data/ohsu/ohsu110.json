The risk of incident coronary events was directly related to SSF. Compared with men in the lowest tertile of SSF, those in the middle tertile experienced a 70% excess of definite CHD. For those in the highest tertile, the excess more than doubled. For a given level of body mass index (BMI), SSF remains a significant and independent predictor of definite CHD, even after adjustment for age, total cholesterol, glucose, triglycerides, hypertensive status, and cigarette smoking. In contrast, the independent effect of BMI was not significant after adjustment for SSF. Thus centrally obese individuals are at increased risk of CHD, independent of BMI.\r"

Proteolipid complexes, 8-11 nm and 25-28 nm in size, were isolated from the plasma of a patient with a borderline ovarian tumour. These complexes, which generated a characteristically long MRS T2 relaxation value (greater than 400 ms), were disrupted by ribonuclease. None of the conventional lipoproteins had a T2 value above 160 ms. Chemical analysis of the proteolipid complexes showed a 20% glycolipid component, and MRS identified a fucosylated molecule as the origin of the long T2 value. 9 months after resection of all tumour, a visible lipoprotein band, possibly lipoprotein (a), persisted in the plasma but neither the long T2 relaxation value nor the 8-11 nm or 25-28 nm particles were present. The long T2 relaxation value in the MRS profile, found in isolated proteolipid and unfractionated plasma and serum of other patients with carcinoma of the ovary and colon, provides a non-invasive method of assaying for cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, 13-15 mg/kg body weight daily) were prospectively evaluated in fifteen patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). The mean concentration of UDCA in serum expressed as the percentage of total bile acids rose from 0% at baseline to 58% (SEM 9%) after 2 years' treatment, whereas total serum bile acid levels did not change significantly. The proportion of patients with pruritus necessitating the use of cholestyramine was significantly lower at 2 years than at baseline. Standard liver function tests improved in all the patients. At 2 years the average activities of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, alkaline phosphatases, and alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin levels were reduced (respectively 78%, 65%, 68%, and 36% of pretreatment values). In three patients who agreed to interrupt the ingestion of UDCA for 3 months after 2 years' treatment there was clear deterioration in liver function tests, which again improved after reinstitution of UDCA. These results suggest that long-term UDCA might be a safe and effective treatment for PBC, but a randomised, controlled, double-blind trial is urgently needed.\r"

The mean follow-up was 29.4 months, with stroke and death as end points. Of the 56 deaths 2 were causally linked to a stroke (crude annual mortality index 9.57%). Of the 10 strokes 7 were judged to be infarctions in carotid territory. 7 out of 20 patients with transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) had ischaemic symptoms definitely related to carotid territory. The crude annual indices of specific stroke or TIA were 0.45% for nonstenotic carotid, 0.23% for 0-50% stenosis, 2.48% for 50-75% stenosis, and 1.71% for 75-99% stenosis.

This quantitative review of published studies has evaluated the effects of steroid dose and bolus steroids on the risk of AVN. 22 papers with sufficient information for analysis were identified. The mean steroid dose for the cohort was plotted against the percentage in whom AVN developed. Total dose was divided into non-bolus (oral) and bolus dose, and doses 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after beginning steroids were tested separately for their association with AVN risk. There was a strong correlation between daily total dose and AVN rate (r = 0.61-0.80). Oral dose was strongly correlated with AVN rate (r = 0.70-0.86), but bolus dose was not associated with AVN risk. This strong association between AVN and steroid dose contrasts with the weak relations found in case-control studies from individual centres in which cases and controls received similar steroid regimens and therefore did not differ greatly in steroid dose. The method of deriving a single exposure level per study and comparing the amount of exposure across studies may be useful in assessing whether a drug's toxicity is dose dependent.\r"

All the fetuses were hypoxic and 2 were acidotic. After maternal hyperoxygenation, the fetal pO2 increased to within or near the normal range, and resulted in a sustained increase in the mean blood-velocity in the fetal thoracic aorta. 5 fetuses survived with minimum neonatal morbidity. The effect of maternal hyperoxygenation on the fetal pO2 in such cases may prove to be a useful method of assessing placental function and guiding management.\r"

They can also secrete tumour growth promoting substances and it is highly probable that they help to establish tumour supporting fibrovascular stroma. Macrophages may fuse with other cells (including neoplastic cells) and many malignant properties of these hybrids or of their progeny may be maintained by the macrophage genome. In addition processes that occur after fusion might be important in inducing malignant transformation, especially when fusion has occurred with initiated cells. Superficial spreading melanoma is an example that is in keeping with the hypothesis of cell fusion.\r"

All patients were treated similarly and the results were assessed after a few weeks and then after at least 5 years. IBS can be diagnosed more easily than has been suggested--72% of this series were correctly diagnosed by their referring doctor, and only 12% required radiological studies to exclude organic disease. The response to treatment was considerably better than expected, possibly because of the more aggressive use of high-fibre diets and bulking agents. Thus, 85% of patients were rendered virtually symptom-free in the short term, and 68% were still virtually symptom-free 5 years later. The response to treatment was better in men than in women, in those with constipation than with diarrhoea, when the symptoms had initially been triggered by an episode of acute diarrhoea, and in patients with a relatively short history. With a few simple investigations, sympathetic explanation, and appropriate treatment, most patients with IBS have a good prognosis.\r"

Malignant pleural mesothelioma has now been reported in these villages and accounts for approximately 1% of the total mortality from 1981 to 1985. The principal whitewash once used in this area is predominantly asbestiform tremolite. The fibre is identical in every respect to fibres found in the lung tissues of people with Metsovo lung. The membrane activity of this tremolite is greater than that of the commercially used asbestiform amphiboles amosite and crocidolite. This measure of cytotoxicity lends further support to the hypothesis that this fibre is the agent of Metsovo lung and mesothelioma.\r"

The adolescent failing in school often manifests secondary affective symptoms that tend to obscure underlying developmental deficits. Inadequate educational experiences, family stress, environmental deprivation, and preoccupation with nonacademic sources of gratification can further cloud the picture. Efforts at remediation must overcome the tendency of medical and school professionals, parents, and students themselves to be overly pessimistic about the long-term outcome. With the knowledge of the common causes of school failure and developmental dysfunction in this age group, the general physician can reach a reasonable diagnosis, develop a functional profile of strengths and weaknesses, and collaborate with parents, educators, and the adolescent to effect a comprehensive management plan. The physician's ongoing involvement can be a very important factor stimulating the school to continue to evaluate an individual student's needs and abilities. Parents may need assistance to recognize their child's own strengths and to help the child utilize them appropriately. If the adolescent is helped to see that he or she can make important contributions to society within the spectrum of his or her talents, then the clinician has played a crucial role in the development of a potentially happy and successful adult.\r"

Because chronic disease delays or alters these phases, it becomes imperative for the primary care physician to reassess psychological development periodically for appropriate and intensive counseling. With the advantage of continuous contact with the family and the understanding of the family's structure and interpersonal relationships, the primary care physician may be able to: alleviate struggles for control that may seriously impede care, encourage the teenager to accomplish the psychological tasks of adolescence, both during hospitalization and in follow-up outpatient care visits, promote the adolescent's participation in his or her own health care, and ultimately enhance both the family's and the teenager's adaptation to a chronic illness. Finally, during the terminal phase of an illness, the primary care physician will be able to help the adolescent find meaning in his or her short life, provide the support to help the teenager to disengage from life with dignity, and provide a supportive relationship to the parents and siblings.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of tuberculosis has recently risen in Southeast Florida. In order to determine the number and proportion of tuberculosis cases and the characteristics of tuberculosis that might be related to human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-III (HTLV-III) infection, all patients seen by the Dade County Florida Public Health Department-Tuberculosis Clinic during a 6-month period were medically evaluated and screened for HTLV-III antibody by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of 71 consecutive patients confirmed to have tuberculosis (70 by culture) during the study period, 22 (31%) were seropositive and 49 (69%) were seronegative for HTLV-III antibody. The seropositive group had a significantly higher proportion of patients who were black, Haitian, and within the age group of 25 to 44 yr. The seropositive group also had a significantly higher rate of mild-to-moderate serum aspartate transaminase elevations (less than or equal to 5 times normal), tuberculin skin test false negativity, extrapulmonary tuberculosis (especially lymphatic), and pulmonary tuberculosis with an atypical radiographic picture. The seropositive group had a significantly lower proportion of patients with sputum cultures positive for M. tuberculosis. There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to the proportion of patients with positive sputum smears when sputum cultures were positive, serious antituberculosis drug reactions (requiring discontinuation of therapy), or percent of home contacts who were tuberculin skin tested and found to be positive. At the time of the diagnosis of tuberculosis, only 6 (27%) of the seropositive patients with tuberculosis had clinical evidence of AIDS or AIDS-related complex (unexplained thrush).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The appearance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and macrophages (MAC) in lung during the development of hyaline membrane disease (HMD) may be important in lung injury and repair. These inflammatory cells may cause additional lung injury during recovery from HMD and contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). By morphometric methods, we compared the proportion of PMN and MAC in lung tissue of premature M. nemestrina monkeys with HMD to the proportion of these cells in the lungs of healthy control animals of a similar postnatal age and to fetuses of the same gestational age. Expressed as a fraction of all lung cells, healthy premature control monkeys have the same %PMN and %MAC in lung tissue as fetal animals. However, during the development of acute HMD, there is an increase in %PMN (p less than 0.05), but not in %MAC, compared to fetal animals. During recovery, there is a greater than 10-fold increase in %MAC (p less than 0.02), but no significant additional increase in %PMN compared to animals with acute HMD. We conclude that the sequence of inflammatory cell migration into the premature lung injured during HMD is first a polymorphonuclear one, followed by entry of macrophages. Control of this inflammatory response during recovery from HMD may play a role in the pathogenesis of BPD.\r"

Of 16 patients with only neurologic problems or other HIV-related conditions, but not the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), 11 had virus recovered; over half of those with AIDS also had virus isolated. Patients with headache or altered mental status had the highest recovery rate of HIV from cerebrospinal fluid. Although virus was primarily found in patients with detectable neurologic disease, it was also isolated from 5 of 8 patients with normal neurologic examinations. Two of these patients had fever alone. The presence of virus in cerebrospinal fluid did not necessarily correlate with isolation of virus from the serum. These findings suggest that HIV may at times replicate preferentially in the brain and that its presence may not immediately cause neurologic signs or symptoms.\r"

Most of the 26 methicillin-resistant isolates were susceptible to cephalothin and cefamandole, but very few were susceptible to ceftriaxone, and none was susceptible to cephradine. The proportion of bacterial cells that grew in the presence of 128 micrograms of methicillin per ml was calculated for each methicillin-resistant isolate. Those with every cell or 1 in 10 cells resistant to 128 micrograms of methicillin per ml included the isolates that were most resistant to the cephalosporins and highly resistant to methicillin. Those with 1 cell resistant in 10(5) or 10(6) cells were the isolates most susceptible to the cephalosporins, and their methicillin MICs were lower. When cells resistant to 128 micrograms of methicillin per ml were used as inocula for broth microdilution tests, resistance to cephradine remained the same, but resistance to ceftriaxone, cephalothin, and cefamandole increased significantly. Cefamandole was the only cephalosporin which retained antibacterial activity against some methicillin-resistant isolates (12 of 26). Cephradine, ceftriaxone, cephalothin, and cefamandole resistance appeared to be expressed by the same cells that expressed methicillin resistance. In this way, cross resistance was demonstrated between methicillin and the cephalosporins.\r"

  ".W": "The inter-regional epidemiological study of childhood cancer analysed data on 234 children diagnosed with leukaemia or lymphoma and 468 controls matched for age and sex. A wide range of potential risk factors was examined, including prenatal exposure to x rays, maternal drug ingestion and smoking, child's medical history, and parental medical conditions and occupation. Calculations were completed for leukaemia or lymphoma and diagnostic subgroups, as defined by laboratory confirmed cell type. In utero exposure to narcotic analgesics was weakly associated with leukaemia or lymphoma but no other antenatal factors gave significant risks. New associations were identified for skin diseases in both parents and congenital abnormalities in the mothers of children with leukaemia. For past medical conditions in the child, viral disease occurring under 6 months of age increased the risk for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Fewer children in the leukaemia or lymphoma group had been immunised compared with the control groups. Case children diagnosed over the age of 9 years were more likely than controls to have had four or more previous episodes of illness. Overall, these results indicate that prenatal factors may be less important than postnatal or genetic influences in the development of leukaemia or lymphoma in children.\r"

  ".U": "87185839\r", 
  ".W": "The polymorphonuclear granulocyte (PMN) kills ingested bacteria by mechanisms that include myeloperoxidase (MPO) and a sudden increase in oxygen consumption (the oxidative burst), both of which are iron dependent. The magnitude of the oxidative burst and activity of MPO were determined in PMNs during the progression of iron deficiency (ID) and following its treatment in rats. As ID developed, the oxidative burst after zymosan activation was less depressed than the activity of MPO. There was no change in the oxidative burst after activation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or in the generation of superoxide (O2-) by NADPH oxidase-containing particles from PMNs. Following iron treatment, impairment of the oxidative burst after zymosan activation was corrected after 1 day. In contrast, the deficit in MPO activity was not corrected until 7 days after initiation of iron treatment. The pattern of recovery in MPO activity after iron treatment corresponded to the prolonged period of maturation of the PMN primary granule since the formation of primary granules, which contain MPO, takes place only in the early, mitotic stages of maturation. The tendency of the PMN to maintain the oxidative burst allows the cell to preserve its capacity for bacterial killing during the progression of iron deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "The primary objective of this study was to define the pH conditions under which supplemental pancreatic enzyme preparations must function in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The hypothesis was that normal or greater acid output in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), combined with low pancreatic bicarbonate output, results in an acidic duodenal pH, compromising both dosage-form performance and enzyme activity. Gastrointestinal pH profiles were obtained in 10 CF and 10 healthy volunteers under fasting and postprandial conditions. A radiotelemetric monitoring method, the Heidelberg capsule, was used to continuously monitor pH. Postprandial duodenal pH was lower in CF than in healthy subjects, especially in the first postprandial hour (mean time greater than pH 6 was 5 min in CF, 11 min in healthy subjects, P less than 0.05). Based on the dissolution pH profiles of current enteric-coated pancreatic enzyme products, the duodenal postprandial pH in CF subjects may be too acidic to permit rapid dissolution of current enteric-coated dosage forms. However, the pH was above 4 more than 90% of the time on the average, suggesting that irreversible lipase inactivation in the duodenum is not likely to be a significant limitation to enzyme efficacy. Overall results suggest that slow dissolution of pH-sensitive coatings, rather than enzyme inactivation, may contribute to the failure of enteric-coated enzyme supplements to normalize fat absorption.\r"

  ".W": "Only antibodies of the IgM class support the lytic effect of complement on Giardia lamblia (GL). We sensitized GL trophozoites (SGL) at 4 degrees C with serum containing anti-GL antibodies or IgM purified from this serum, and either normal human serum (NHS), complement 2-deficient human serum (C2d-HS), or C4-deficient guinea pig serum was used as source of complement. SGL were killed by NHS (86%) and by the deficient sera (50 and 40%, respectively), suggesting activation of the alternative pathway. However, the reaction was inhibited by Mg-EGTA. These observations led to studies of the role of C1. The lytic effect of NHS and C2d-HS on SGL was abolished by immunochemically depleting C1 from these sera, and reconstituted by adding purified C1q plus C1r and C1s. Factor B-depleted C2d-HS also lost its capacity to mediate killing, but reconstitution with factor B led to a dose-dependent increase in the killing of SGL. We next investigated the participation of the membrane attack complex in this system. SGL carrying C5b to C7 were lysed when incubated with C8 alone (56%); the addition of C9 further increased killing (98%), while C9 in the absence of C8 had no effect. We concluded that although activation of the classical pathway produces lysis of SGL, lysis may also proceed through a unique pathway of complement activation that requires C1 and factor B, but is independent of C4 and C2. Lysis of SGL can be accomplished by C5b to C8 in the absence of C9.\r"

Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a neutrophil cationic enzyme that localizes in glomeruli, can react with H2O2 and halides to form highly reactive products. We tested the hypothesis that the MPO-H2O2-halide system may induce glomerular injury by infusing MPO followed by H2O2 in a chloride-containing solution into the renal artery of rats. Controls received MPO or H2O2 alone. MPO-H2O2-perfused rats developed significant proteinuria, endothelial cell swelling, and epithelial cell foot process effacement, whereas control kidneys were normal. In the presence of free 125I, MPO-H2O2-perfused rats incorporated large amounts of 125I, localized to the glomerular basement membrane and mesangium by autoradiography, into glomeruli. Glomerular iodination was greatly decreased or absent in controls. The MPO-H2O2-halide system causes glomerular injury and may be important in neutrophil-mediated glomerulonephritis.\r"

We now report that the platelets of normal donors exhibit stable quantitative differences in the expression of this receptor molecule, as determined by flow cytometry using fluorescent staining with murine monoclonal antibody to p40 (mab IV.3). These inter-donor differences were reproducible on repeated testing over at least 4 mo. In concurrent assays, the binding of mab IV.3 to each donor's platelets was highly correlated with the binding of heat-aggregated human IgG, also assayed by flow cytometry. The biological relevance of this quantitative variation in IV.3 binding is suggested by its reproducible correlation with platelet responsiveness to aggregated IgG measured by aggregometry. Such stable quantitative variation in platelet Fc receptor expression among individual humans could contribute to differences in severity of certain pathologic processes initiated by IgG-containing immune complexes.\r"

Cytotoxicity was greatest when using the IgG3, followed in rank order by the IgG2a and IgG2b. No cytotoxicity was observed with the IgG1 antibody. Because the antigen-binding regions of the antibodies are identical, the differences in cytotoxicity directly reflect the relative affinity of LGL Fc receptors for each antibody isotype.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to block the interactions between IgE and its receptor on mast cells (Fc epsilon R), we have established anti-Fc epsilon R monoclonal antibodies (mAb) by fusion of myeloma cells with mouse splenocytes immunized with irradiated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. Two anti-Fc epsilon R mAb were obtained (denoted 4.7 and 5.14) that could specifically bind to RBL and mast cells. This binding could be inhibited by IgE. The mAb and their F(ab')2 fragments inhibited 125I-IgE binding to RBL cell and triggered cell degranulation. The Fab' fragments, on the other hand, could only inhibit IgE binding but did not stimulate cell degranulation. Furthermore, these monovalent fragments inhibited RBL and mast cell degranulation induced by IgE-antigen complexes both in vitro and in vivo in the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction. The number of mAb 4.7 and 5.14 molecules bound per RBL cells was similar to that of IgE; nevertheless, mAb 4.7 and 5.14 recognized different epitopes on the IgE receptor. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that the mAb reacted with the alpha-subunit of the Fc epsilon R. Our findings establish the anti-Fc epsilon R mAb as a useful reagent for the isolation and characterization of the Fc epsilon R's alpha-subunit and the monomeric (Fab') for blocking the IgE-Fc epsilon R interactions.\r"

  ".W": "Current methods for determining plasma prekallikrein, one of three zymogens of the contact phase of plasma proteolysis, are laborious and impractical for general use in a clinical laboratory. Therefore, we have developed a simple, reliable assay using commercially available reagents. By use of the substrate H-D-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide-HCI (S-2302), a functional assay, performed in a 96-well microplate, was designed to measure prekallikrein in plasma. Measures were taken to destroy the naturally occurring plasma protease inhibitors of kallikrein without affecting the integrity of the plasma prekallikrein, which allowed complete activation of the zymogen to virtually 100% of predicted activity when compared with that of purified kallikrein. Besides permitting full activation, the use of low pH to destroy critical plasma protease inhibitors allowed the conversion of prekallikrein to kallikrein in as many as 44 plasma samples at one time without the tedious individual timing step usually required to activate each sample. An excellent correlation was found (r = 0.92) when this functional microassay was compared with a functional spectrophotometric assay performed in three subject populations: normal individuals, women receiving oral contraceptives (who frequently exhibit high plasma prekallikrein concentrations), and patients with liver disease (who manifest low plasma prekallikrein levels). This plasma prekallikrein microassay should facilitate the increased determination of plasma prekallikrein in pathophysiologic conditions as well as the monitoring of the progression of various diseases in which contact activation occurs.\r"

To further evaluate the potential physiologic role of this system, we measured three components of the KKK system in urine. Total kallikrein, intact kininogen, and kinin were measured twice in normal individuals during balance on both a high (250 mEq/day) or low (10 mEq/day) sodium intake. A consistent and significant reduction in the activity of all three components of the KKK system was noted during the high salt intake. Furthermore, during the high sodium intake, further acute reductions in components of this system were observed when an acute saline but not water load was administered. The consistent response of the various components of the KKK system to both acute and chronic sodium loading suggests that the system is physiologically linked to the regulation of sodium balance. However, the directional changes argue against a primary natriuretic effect of this system.\r"

Before relief of obstruction fractional sodium excretion was appropriate for the reduced rate of glomerular filtration. After urethral catheterisation blood pressure fell (p less than 0.001) and the other cardiovascular abnormalities were rapidly reversed without further therapeutic measures. This improvement was associated with an increase (p less than 0.05) in both absolute and fractional urinary sodium excretion that was greatest at 24 h. 5% of patients undergoing surgery for obstructive disorders of the lower urinary tract have hydronephrosis and hydroureter. Hypertension related to chronic urinary tract obstruction may be the commonest form of surgically correctable renal hypertension.\r"

The binding of a lectin (HPA), derived from the albumin gland of the Roman snail, Helix pomatia, to N-acetyl-galactosaminyl oligosaccharides appears valuable in assessing long-term prognosis. The clinical progress of 179 patients, followed-up for 15-20 years, was related to staining of paraffin sections of their primary breast cancers by HPA. All patients had had mastectomy but were not stratified by pathology or treatment. There were significant differences, in premenopausal patients, between groups with and without HPA staining in both time to first recurrence and survival time. HPA binding provides an extra tool for staging to aid decisions in early adjuvant treatment, with the advantage of being applicable to routinely fixed paraffin-embedded material.\r"

Model predictions are particularly sensitive to assumptions about the distributed incubation period of the disease, differences in frequency and patterns of sexual activity, and the proportion of infected people in whom AIDS later develops. More accurate predictions will depend on the collection of data on the incubation period of the disease, the infectiousness of infected persons, and on the numbers of new sexual partners of each sex per person and the duration of each partnership.\r"

With this simple approach the majority of women at highest risk of osteoporotic fractures in later life can be identified in the early postmenopausal period and started on prophylactic hormone replacement therapy.\r"

By 20 years 35% were dead. Mortality was often attributable to RA. Function improved in the early years of treatment but declined considerably between 10 and 20 years. At 20 years 19% were severely disabled. Radiographs showed related evidence of increasing joint destruction. The ESR and rheumatoid factor levels changed little. Age, late presentation, and rheumatoid factor seropositivity at presentation were poor prognostic factors. The concept of \"remission-inducing\" drugs is fallacious. Early treatment may be advantageous, but the prognosis of RA is not good.\r"

There would be considerable danger to patients and the change would be expensive. Most importantly, molar units for drugs will not benefit doctors or their patients. Mass units should be retained and proposals for the adoption of molar units should be abandoned.\r"

Most patients had acute gastroenteritis; 1 had a liver abscess. 20% were admitted to hospital; the mean duration of hospital stay was 9 days. YE infection was strongly associated with eating raw pork in the 2 weeks before onset (odds ratio = 12, p = 0.00002), a factor that accounted for 58% of the YE infections studied. 14 (18%) of 79 families surveyed at a well-baby clinic fed their children raw pork from a median age of 18 months. Specific control measures to reduce contamination and consumption of raw pork may reduce the incidence of YE infections.\r"
