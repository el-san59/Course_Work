  ".W": "The efficacy of a program of transfusion of previously deposited autologous blood for patients undergoing total hip-replacement surgery was studied by comparing five different parameters for a group of fifty consecutive patients who deposited blood for autologous transfusion and a randomly chosen, closely matched control group of fifty patients who received only homologous blood. Sixty-two per cent of the patients in the group that deposited autologous blood did not receive additional homologous blood while in the hospital. The patients who deposited autologous blood had a mean preoperative hematocrit of 36 per cent, compared with 39 per cent for the control group, but the average postoperative hematocrits of the two groups did not differ (33 per cent). There was no significant difference in the average total loss of blood or need for replacement of blood between the groups. Transfusion-related complications developed in two patients in the control group. We concluded that previous deposit of autologous blood for transfusion is an effective method for reducing the need for transfusion of homologous blood and for avoiding the attendant complications of transfusion of homologous blood. This method of the replacement of blood should be considered for patients who are to undergo a major orthopaedic procedure on the hip.\r"

The patients ranged in age from ten to forty-nine years. Each patient began to take 325 milligrams of ferrous sulphate, three times a day, as soon as surgery was scheduled, and was evaluated weekly at the Shepeard Community Blood Bank. If a patient's hemoglobin level was more than eleven milligrams per 100 milliliters, either a whole unit of blood or a half-unit was drawn at each visit. An average of 3.3 units of blood (range, 1.5 to 6.0 units) was obtained and was stored for as long as forty-two days. Either citrate phosphate dextrose with adenine (CPDA-1) or adenine, dextrose, and mannitol (ADSOL) was used as a preservative. In 85 per cent of the procedures only autologous blood was required for transfusion. This method proved to be simple, safe, and very well accepted.\r"

  ".U": "87137745\r", 
  ".W": "The results in ninety-three knees that had been treated by proximal tibial opening-wedge osteotomy for varus deformity and osteoarthritis of the medial compartment were evaluated after a mean length of follow-up of 11.5 years (range, ten to thirteen years). After ten years, only forty-two (45 per cent) of the ninety-three knees had an excellent or good result, and in fifty-one knees there was recurrent pain for which seventeen had another operation. At five years, on the other hand, 90 per cent of the knees had a good result. Deterioration occurred at an average of seven years after the osteotomy and was always associated with recurrence of pain. Although the results deteriorated with time, time was not the only determinant of the result. Alignment, measured as the hip-knee-ankle angle on radiographs of the whole limb that were made with the patient bearing weight, was also a determinant of long-term results. The best results were obtained in the twenty knees that had a hip-knee-ankle angle of 183 to 186 degrees. In these knees, there was no pain and no progression of the arthrosis in either the medial or the lateral tibiofemoral compartment. Of the five knees that had an angle of more than 186 degrees, all five had progressive degenerative changes in the lateral compartment. In the sixty-eight undercorrected knees (an angle of less than 183 degrees), the results were less satisfactory, and there was a tendency toward recurrence of the varus deformity and progression of the arthritis of the medial compartment. However, when the correction was insufficient the deterioration was slow (average, seven years), and it was not associated with lateral laxity and deterioration of the lateral compartment, which are the changes that characterize the natural course of gonarthrosis as described by Hernborg and Nilsson. Therefore, proximal tibial osteotomy is a very suitable operation for patients who have gonarthrosis of the medial compartment, but a rigidly standardized and precise operative technique is required as well as accurate radiographic measurements of the mechanical axis of the limb, because exact postoperative alignment is the prerequisite for the longest possible period of relief of symptoms after osteotomy.\r"

Two-plane fixation was significantly more rigid than one-plane fixation in three of the five loading conditions that were examined. The more rigid fixation allowed less lateral displacement at the site of the osteotomy, induced less formation of callus early in the healing process, permitted direct bridging by osteons more frequently, and provided healing that was more rigid early in the process of repair. In the later stages of healing there were no differences in the quantity of callus or in the strength of the healing bone. In this canine model, external fixation with higher rigidity resulted in rapid union that differed from the union that resulted after less rigid external fixation only with regard to porosity, torsional stiffness, and displacement at the site of the fracture.\r"

Six of the seven patients had a skeletal femoral defect, ranging from seven to fifteen centimeters in length. The average length of fibula that was used for reconstruction was 19.6 centimeters. Primary skeletal union occurred in five of the seven patients. Two patients had healing only at the distal junction and required a conventional bone graft and supplementary internal fixation of the proximal junction. At an average length of follow-up of thirty-four months, all of the patients were able to walk. Only two patients, both of whom had an extreme limb-length discrepancy, required additional support.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred and fifty-six of 257 shoulders in 254 patients who were between the ages of twelve and forty years and who had primary anterior dislocation of the shoulder that was treated by immobilization for at least three weeks or by early movement were followed for five years in a prospective multicenter study. Two or more recurrences had occurred in 55 per cent of the shoulders in patients who were twenty-two years old or younger, in 37 per cent of the shoulders in patients who were twenty-three to twenty-nine years old, and in 12 per cent of the shoulders in patients who were thirty to forty years old. Surgery for the treatment of instability had been performed or was scheduled to be performed in 28, 18, and 5 per cent of the shoulders, respectively, in the three age-groups. The dislocation recurred in only one of thirty-two shoulders that had a fracture of the greater tuberosity (p less than 0.001). The results as regards recurrence after five years were not influenced by immobilization of the shoulder for three to four weeks after the initial dislocation, bilateral dislocation, or the type of initial trauma and athletic activity. A moderate impression fracture of the humeral head (Hermodsson or Hill-Sachs) did not change the prognosis in the younger patients (twenty-two years old or younger). However, in the patients who were twenty-three to forty years old the rate of recurrence was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) when this injury was demonstrated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The clinical and neurological manifestations were varied and included cardiorespiratory arrest, motor weakness, quadriplegia, torticollis, pain in the neck, vertigo, and projectile vomiting. All of the patients underwent posterior arthrodesis of the occiput to the first or second cervical vertebra. In the patients who had trauma-related instability, surgery was performed when immobilization in a cast failed to stabilize the spine; in the patients who had a congenital abnormality, arthrodesis was indicated because of persistent symptoms and the potential for catastrophe with minor trauma. Based on our experience, we recommend surgical stabilization by posterior arthrodesis when this form of instability of the cervical spine is diagnosed.\r"

Urokinase increased the survival of the limbs after both four and five hours of ischemia at room temperature to 100 per cent compared with 50 and 20 per cent, respectively, in untreated controls. Nitrendipine significantly increased the blood flow but failed to significantly increase the survival of the limb. Scanning electron microscopy was used to assist in the evaluation of the endothelium of the vessels. The etiological mechanism of the no-reflow phenomenon appears to be that ischemia damages the endothelial cells, causing impairment of the fibrinolytic system, retraction of the endothelial membrane, exposure of the subintimal collagen, and fibrin-platelet deposition. Thrombosis of the vessels ensues, resulting in the no-reflow phenomenon. Clinical Relevance: Experimentally, intra-arterial infusion of urokinase increased the survival of the limb in replanted extremities that were subjected to ischemia. This effectively lengthened the safe limit of ischemia at room temperature before microsurgical replantation or elective free-tissue transfer. Clinical trials of the use of intra-arterial fibrinolytic agents for the treatment of revascularized tissue are indicated.\r"

Twenty-five patients wore a plaster brace postoperatively for six months, while 25 were managed without a brace. The mean loss of correction from the first standing postoperative radiograph to one obtained two years later was 7 degrees in the braced group, and 6.3 degrees in the unbraced group, the difference not being statistically significant. We conclude that postoperative bracing is unnecessary after augmented Harrington instrumentation.\r"

Those levels were correlated with the histological findings. Three groups of chicks were studied: a control group with no fracture, chicks with fractures fixed by Kirschner wire, and chicks with unfixed fractures. A significant increase in the levels of the active metabolites was found in the callus during the first few days after fracture. The levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D3] and of 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [24,25(OH)2D3] were higher when there was no fixation, while those of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25(OH)2D3] were higher after fixation. The concentrations of these metabolites in the proximal epiphysis of the tibia were similar to those found in the callus. Based on these findings it is suggested that the active metabolites of vitamin D are directly involved in the process of fracture repair.\r"

  ".W": "Infection after intradiscal injections has been recognised as a distinct entity, but discitis after discography has often been attributed to an aseptic process or a chemical reaction to the contrast material. We examined the hypothesis that discitis after discography is always due to infection, and report a clinical review and an experimental study. Part I. We reviewed the case records and radiographs of 432 patients who had undergone lumbar discography. When an 18-gauge needle without a stilette had been used, discitis was diagnosed in 2.7% of 222 patients but stiletted needles and a two-needle technique at each level reduced the incidence to 0.7%. Seven patients with discitis after discography had undergone anterior discectomy and fusion; in them the histopathological findings were of a chronic inflammatory response. Bacteria were isolated from the discs of three of the four patients who had open biopsy less than six weeks from the time of discography. These findings suggest that bacteria were initiators rather than promoters of the response. Part II. Multiple level lumbar discography was carried out in mature sheep, injecting contrast material with or without various concentrations of bacteria. Radiographs were taken and the discs and end-plates were examined histologically and cultured for bacteria at intervals after injection. None of the controls showed any evidence of discitis but all sheep injected with bacteria had typical radiological and histopathological changes by six weeks, though cultures were almost all negative. However, at one and two weeks after injection, but usually not after three weeks, bacteria could be isolated. We suggest that all cases of discitis after discography are initiated by infection, and that a very strict aseptic technique should be used for all injections into intervertebral discs.\r"

Local spinal fusion relieved symptoms in 12 patients; the excised facet joint surfaces showed some of the histological changes seen in chondromalacia patellae and in osteoarthritis of other large joints. The most frequent change was focal full-thickness cartilage necrosis or loss of cartilage with exposure of subchondral bone, but osteophyte formation was remarkably absent in all specimens. We suggest that there are both clinical and histological similarities between the facet arthrosis syndrome and chondromalacia patellae. Facet arthrosis may be a relatively important cause of intractable back pain in young and middle-aged adults.\r"

Fixation by bone ingrowth occurred in 93% of the cases in which a press fit of the stem at the isthmus was achieved, but in only 69% of those without a press fit. The clinical results at two years were excellent. The incidence of pain and limp was much lower when there was either a press fit of the stem or radiographic evidence of bone ingrowth. Factors such as age, sex, and the disease process did not influence the clinical results. Most cases showed only slight resorptive remodelling of the upper femur, but in a few cases with a larger, more rigid stem, more extensive bone loss occurred. The results after five years showed no deterioration with time. Fixation by the ingrowth of bone or of fibrous tissue both appeared to be stable, but bone ingrowth gave better clinical results.\r"

This was associated with lack of acrylic cement in those areas and was also related to the depth of the wear on the articulating surface of the socket. It is suggested that, in some cases, changes at the bone-cement junction are secondary to socket loosening and abrasion against the bone of the acetabulum, rather than to particles migrating from the metal-polyethylene interface. It is therefore important that impingement of the neck of the femoral stem on the edge of the cup be avoided and that, when the socket is inserted, it is not in direct contact with the bone.\r"

The pressure within the hip in different positions was measured in eight children with transient synovitis and four with the synovial stage of Perthes' disease. In the position of comfort for the hip this pressure was always less than the arteriolar blood pressure and in a supine position it did not exceed the systolic blood pressure. However, in extension with medial rotation the intra-articular pressure always became several times the systolic blood pressure. This high pressure was also recorded in the stable lateral position which occurs normally during sleep. It is concluded that in the presence of a synovial effusion in the hip, a position of extension and medial rotation causes an increase in intra-articular pressure which may compromise the blood supply to the capital epiphysis of the femur.\r"

CT scans showed that the hips in the first group were significantly more anteverted than those in the second. Clearly measurement of hip rotation in extension alone does not provide a dependable indication of femoral anteversion in children with intoeing gait; rotation in flexion also needs to be measured.\r"

The patients were reviewed in detail after median periods of 4.5 years and 14.5 years and the results analysed. The frequency of complaints related to the operation increased from 53% at 4.5 years to 67% at 14.5 years, while demonstrable knee instability increased from 10% to 36%. The incidence of radiographic changes of degeneration rose from 40% to 89% and at late review 8% of patients had definite osteoarthritis by the criteria of Ahlback (1968). In consequence 46% had given up or reduced their sporting activity, and 6.5% had changed their occupation. Radiographic deterioration started after the 4.5-year review in 49% of the patients and was more frequent after lateral than medial meniscectomy.\r"

It was found that CT scanning proved most helpful for classifying the type of fracture, for evaluating the degree of comminution, and for measuring displacement. Moreover, because a single position was maintained throughout the investigation, the patients felt less discomfort than during other assessment procedures. For these reasons CT scanning is recommended for evaluating this type of fracture.\r"

This response was graded 1 (failure), 2 (good) and 3 (excellent); Grade 2 or 3 was attained after a mean treatment period of 31.7 months. Subsequent analysis of the vertebral fracture rate revealed that new vertebral fractures had occurred only in patients with Grade 1 and not in those with Grade 2 or 3.

In all, 70% of the hips showed good function despite a reduced range of movement, but patients with bilateral arthroplasties fared poorly. Excellent containment within the acetabulum was found in 80%, but the femoral head was always abnormally high though not unduly lateral or medial. This configuration had remained unchanged during follow-up. The accuracy of reduction along the mediolateral axis was the only variable found to influence the outcome significantly. Functional deterioration, associated with pain, was noted to be more common after 20 years than before, and was associated with radiographic evidence of joint degeneration.\r"

Specimens were also taken from the equivalent sites in otherwise normal subjects at autopsy, and from various other sites of traumatic fractures; these two latter groups acted as controls. Analysis of the 57 specimens disclosed changes in the nature of the bone at the site of subcapital fractures, namely the presence of relatively large crystals of hydroxyapatite and a change in the molecular orientation, but not total content, of the acidic proteoglycans of the bone matrix. Our results have confirmed and extended the findings of others on subcapital fractures, and have also shown very similar changes in the trochanteric fractures. It thus appears that the bony changes in the two types of proximal femoral fracture are not as different as has been suggested.\r"

Statistically significant correlations were found between Stulberg class and Iowa hip score; age at diagnosis and Stulberg class; age at follow-up and Iowa hip score; and between lateral subluxation of the femoral head and Iowa hip score. Three age-groups of patients were found to carry different long-term prognoses. Those below five years of age at diagnosis showed a statistically significant correlation between Catterall group and Stulberg Classes I and II. Patients between five and nine years of age at diagnosis showed a significant correlation between Catterall group and Stulberg Classes I, II, III and IV while in patients diagnosed after nine years of age there was no statistical correlation between Catterall group and Stulberg class, all having a poor prognosis and ending up in Stulberg Classes III, IV and V.\r"

  ".W": "Complete dislocation of the knee is a relatively rare condition. When it occurs as a result of high-velocity injury, such as in a road traffic accident, associated vascular injury is generally suspected. In low-velocity injuries, however, distal pulses are often maintained throughout, and the possibility of vascular injury may erroneously be discounted. We report four cases of low-velocity dislocation of the knee, only one of which had an overt vascular disruption, but three of which had arterial damage. On the basis of our experiences, we recommend arteriography in all cases of complete dislocation of the knee.\r"

Using vibration sensors attached to bony prominences around the knee, we studied the joints of both normal and symptomatic subjects. Normal subjects produced three signal types--physiological patellofemoral crepitus, patellar clicks, and the lateral band signal. In symptomatic subjects we identified and categorised many signal types and related them to pathology. Lesions of the menisci produced distinctive signals, and it was possible not only to lateralise the tear, but in many cases to determine the type of meniscal injury present. Vibration arthrography promises to be a useful tool in the non-invasive diagnosis of knee disorders.\r"

The system has been assessed against a new \"unblocked\" test for anterior subluxation and against radiographic measurements, operative findings and results. This grading system can be valuable in pre-operative assessment and planning and its use in postoperative evaluation would enable results from different centres and different procedures to be compared more accurately.\r"

Although muscle blood flow was normal at the start of exercise, pain and impaired muscle function eventually developed; muscle blood flow decreased while muscle relaxation pressure increased. The changes of muscle blood flow could not be correlated with any change of mean muscle pressure during exercise. Eight months after fasciotomy the exercise test was repeated. Patients experienced no symptoms and the muscle relaxation pressure and blood flow during exercise were normal. It is suggested that chronic compartment syndrome is due to increased muscle relaxation pressure during exercise which causes decreased muscle blood flow, leading to ischaemic pain and impaired muscle function.\r"

All the knees showed mild synovitis, and there was no significant growth into the intra-articular part of any ligament. Carbon fibre and xenograft did not appear to be suitable materials in this animal model. The composite ligament showed short-term ingrowth of fibrous tissue only into the periphery of the sheath in its intra-osseous portion, whereas the Dacron ligament showed progressive fibrous tissue ingrowth with some bony incorporation of its outer fibres.\r"

Addition of purified high density lipoproteins (HDL) as well as low density lipoproteins [very low density (VLDL) plus low density lipoproteins (LDL)] restored optimal synthesis of progesterone, and HDL was as effective as VLDL + LDL. The use of cholesterol doubly labeled lipoproteins allowed calculation of the proportions of free and esterified cholesterol converted into progesterone. Granulosa cells used either free or esterified cholesterol from VLDL + LDL. In contrast, HDL-esterified cholesterol was a poor substrate for progesterone synthesis, while HDL-free cholesterol was used preferentially. LH increased the use of both kinds of lipoproteins without changing the way in which they were used. Pretreatment of HDL by purified phospholipase A2 increased the conversion of free cholesterol into progesterone. Similar treatment of VLDL + LDL had little effect on progesterone secretion. We conclude that HDL as well as VLDL + LDL can provide cholesterol to human preovulatory granulosa cells and that utilization of HDL-cholesterol may depend on gonadotropin (LH) and enzymatic (phospholipase) regulation.\r"

The estimated radiotherapy (RT) doses to the hypothalamus and pituitary were 3979 +/- 78 (+/- SD) and 6167 +/- 122 centiGrays, respectively. All patients had normal pituitary function before RT. One year after RT, there was a significant decrease in the integrated serum GH response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. In the male patients, basal serum FSH significantly increased, while basal serum LH and testosterone did not change. Moreover, in response to LHRH, the integrated FSH response was increased while that of LH was decreased. Such discordant changes in FSH and LH may be explained by a defect in LHRH pulsatile release involving predominantly a decrease in pulse frequency. The peak serum TSH response to TRH became delayed in 28 patients, suggesting a defect in TRH release. Twenty-one patients were reassessed 2 yr after RT. Their mean basal serum T4 and plasma cortisol levels had significantly decreased. Hyperprolactinemia associated with oligomenorrhoea was found in 3 women. Further impairment in the secretion of GH, FSH, LH, TSH, and ACTH had occurred, and 4 patients had hypopituitarism. Thus, progressive impairment in hypothalamic-pituitary function occurs after cranial irradiation and can be demonstrated as early as 1 yr after RT.\r"

  ".U": "87138137\r", 
  ".W": "When hCG adsorbs to surfaces, including membranes from tissues that lack specific hCG receptors, it adsorbs with a particular orientation. Some sites on the alpha- and beta-subunits project away from the surface and can be detected with radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies. Other epitopes, which are located on a region on the hormone that presumably contacts the surface, lose their ability to bind antibody. Using antibodies specific for epitopes on hCG which remain exposed and can be detected when the hormone is adsorbed to rat brain homogenates, we found hCG or closely related substances bound to progestational decidual tissues. Immunologically reactive material adsorbed to the decidual tissue increased and decreased in parallel with the serum levels of hCG throughout pregnancy. Binding of labeled monoclonal antibody to substances similar or identical to hCG in other tissues, including placenta and fetal lung, but not red cells, also was identified. Unlike material adsorbed to decidual tissues, receptor-bound hCG was not recognized by any of our alpha-subunit-specific antibodies. This finding suggests either that the adsorbed hormone has a different orientation than receptor-bound hormone or that the adsorbed hormone has dissociated into subunits. These studies represent the first detection of nonreceptor binding of hCG or related molecules to tissues lacking receptors or presumed not to synthesize the hormone. The role of nonreceptor-bound hCG, if any, is unknown. Other than its effects on stimulation of luteal steroidogenesis during early pregnancy, the role of hCG during most of pregnancy has not been determined. Conceivably, the nonreceptor binding we identified is related to a role for hCG in pregnancy that is not associated with an action on the ovarian LH receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The immunological mechanisms involved in Graves' ophthalmopathy are not known. To explore the pathophysiology of this disorder, we used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies that bound to the 100,000 X g sediment fraction of porcine eye muscle. Serum from patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy had enhanced immunoglobulin binding to porcine eye muscle compared to serum from control subjects (P less than 0.0001); however, several individual normal serum samples also had elevated binding activity. Incubation of serum from some Graves' patients with skeletal muscle or liver tissue resulted in reduction in immunoglobulin binding to porcine eye muscle. Thyroglobulin and TSH reduced binding only at high concentrations. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed some obvious differences in protein bands between porcine eye muscle and skeletal muscle. Serum from many normal subjects and patients with autoimmune thyroid disease formed bands with skeletal muscle protein fractions on immunoblotting, and no specific bands were found using serum from Graves' ophthalmopathy patients. Immunoblots of Graves' patients' serum after reaction with either porcine skeletal or eye muscle showed no reactivity with thyroglobulin (200K and 320K) or thyroid microsomal antigen (105K). Instead, immunoblots of eye muscle and serum from Graves' patients, with or without eye disease, showed two bands at 64K and 73K, which were shared by serum from normal subjects. In addition, several unique eye muscle determinants were detected in serum from 6 of 13 Graves' disease patients analyzed. These unique bands usually had mol wt of less than 50K, and 5 of the 6 patients whose serum reacted with these determinants had significant ophthalmopathy. Our findings support the presence of potential antigenic differences between eye muscle and skeletal muscle accounting for the immunological specificity of eye muscle as a target in Graves' ophthalmopathy.\r"

Both normal and LPD cycles had a maximum amount of endometrial cytosolic progesterone receptor (PgR) on days 13-15, with a significant decline thereafter. LPD cycles had significantly lower endometrial nuclear PgR concentrations than did normal cycles during the proliferative phase, but luteal phase endometrial nuclear PgR levels were similar in both groups. In 2 LPD women treated with dydrogesterone, normal endometrial maturation and a decline in endometrial cytosolic PgR concentrations in the late luteal phase were found. Therefore, with the exception of endometrial nuclear PgR concentrations during the proliferative phase, we found no evidence for a major abnormality in endometrial PgR levels in LPD cycles with a lag in endometrial histology.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that human albumin-bound testosterone (HSA-bound T), the major constituent of nonsex hormone-binding globulin-bound T (non-SHBG-bound T), is biologically important. To examine the potential exposure of peripheral tissues to T in normal prepubertal boys, we determined the distribution of serum T into SHBG-bound, HSA-bound, non-SHBG-bound, and free fractions in 80 normal males, aged 0.5-14 yr, all at Tanner stage I of sexual development. A model assuming equilibrium between free T and T bound to 2-binding proteins (HSA and SHBG) was used. A computer program, using as constants the SHBG-T and HSA-T affinity constants and the serum HSA concentration and as variables the serum SHBG and total T concentrations, was used to calculate SHBG-bound T, HSA-bound T, non-SHBG-bound T, and free T. Serum total T increased 2.6-fold from 0.5 to 14 yr, whereas non-SHBG-bound T, HSA-bound T, and free T increased 8- to 9-fold during the same period. On the other hand, SHBG-bound T increased only 1.9-fold. Expressed as a function of serum total T, non-SHBG-bound T increased from 6.6% to 30.4%, the relative increment being greater for HSA-bound than for free T. We conclude that with advancing age, there is a progressive increase in the exposure of all tissues to T in normal prepubertal boys. At the level of the central nervous system, this increase in serum bioavailable T could induce maturative changes in brain cells that result in the onset of puberty in normal boys.\r"

SCA or AA preceded adrenocortical failure in 12 of the 13 patients and were found in 2 of 9 patients (so far) who still have normal adrenal function (P = 0.001). SCA preceded ovarian failure in all 11 patients and were found in 6 of 11 patients who still have normal ovarian function (P = 0.02). The sensitivities/specificities/predictive values were 0.77/0.78/0.90 in all patients for SCA predicting adrenocortical failure, and 0.92/0.89/0.92 for adrenal-binding antibody (which includes all AA and most SCA) in predicting adrenocortical failure. The sensitivities/specificities/predictive values in females who initially had normal adrenocortical and ovarian function were 1.0/0.56/0.50 for SCA in predicting ovarian failure, 0.86/0.83/0.86 for SCA in predicting adrenocortical failure, and 1.0/1.0/1.0 for adrenal-binding antibody in predicting adrenocortical failure. Thus, the appearance of AA or SCA in a male patient without adrenocortical failure or a female patient without adrenocortical or ovarian failure signals a high risk of their development.\r"

  ".W": "Somatomedins are important mediators of GH action on skeletal tissues. A possible cause of growth failure, therefore, is impaired somatomedin (Sm) responsiveness of the target tissues. To investigate Sm responsiveness, we studied fibroblasts from 11 normal-statured individuals and 9 patients with short stature. Five of the short patients had normal serum GH and normal or increased Sm levels and, therefore, are considered possibly to be Sm resistant. The other short patients include 2 with Laron-type dwarfism and 2 with GH resistance of undefined type. As a measure of Sm responsiveness, we determined the ability of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I; Sm-C) to stimulate uptake of [3H]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid by fibroblasts. The mean ED50 of the 11 normal fibroblast cell lines was 3.2 +/- 0.9 (+/- SD) ng/ml. Fibroblasts from 8 of the 9 short-statured patients had ED50 values within the normal range. This included 2 fibroblast lines isolated from children with Laron-type dwarfism. Fibroblasts from 1 patient, however, were significantly less sensitive to IGF-I in 9 separate assays, with an ED50 of 10.7 +/- 1.8 ng/ml. Fibroblasts from the mother of the patient had an ED50 of 5.0 +/- 1.4 ng/ml, and fibroblasts from the father had an ED50 of 4.3 +/- 0.7 ng/ml, both above the normal mean. Measurements of [125I]IGF-I binding by suspended fibroblasts from this patient and her parents failed to demonstrate significant abnormalities in either the number of binding sites or the affinity of binding. We conclude that the ability of IGF-I to stimulate [3H]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake by human fibroblasts provides a useful method of identifying short children with Sm resistance. Of five patients with clinical evidence of possible Sm resistance, fibroblasts from one consistently were hyporesponsive to IGF-I. Cells from two patients with Laron-type dwarfism were normally responsive to IGF-I.\r"

  ".W": "The cause of the amenorrhea that occurs in patients with hyperprolactinemia is unknown. The involvement of endogenous opioid peptides in the inhibition of GnRH release as a central factor leading to the hypogonadotropic state has been recently described. This study analyzed the LH response to opiate receptor blockade by naloxone (4 mg, iv) in groups of subjects with amenorrhea due to hyperprolactinemia of different etiologies. Patients presenting with a PRL-secreting pituitary adenoma (n = 7), idiopathic hyperprolactinemia (n = 9), or hyperprolactinemia during pharmacological treatment for schizophrenia (n = 5) were studied. Furthermore, to evaluate whether high circulating PRL levels influence the activity of the opioid system after the menopause, a group of seven postmenopausal subjects was tested before and 1 week after the administration of metoclopramide (10 mg, three times a day), a dopamine receptor antagonist. Normal premenopausal women (n = 6) served as controls. Naloxone significantly increased plasma LH levels in both prolactinoma and idiopathic hyperprolactinemic patients (P less than 0.01 vs. basal and placebo). In neither of those groups was a significant correlation found between the plasma LH response to naloxone and basal plasma PRL levels. In contrast to pathological hyperprolactinemia, blockade of opiate receptors did not significantly change LH secretion in either amenorrheic women with pharmacologically induced hyperprolactinemia or postmenopausal women. These results suggest that the effect of hyperprolactinemia on opioid modulation of LH secretion is related to the nature of the hyperprolactinemic state, supporting the existence of increased opioid inhibition of LH levels in pathological hyperprolactinemia.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of growth by the GH-dependent mitogen somatomedin-C (Sm-C) may involve not only changes in circulating levels of Sm-C, but also alterations in cellular sensitivity to Sm-C induced by humoral factors. Glucocorticoids have been reported to enhance the stimulatory effect of Sm-C on DNA synthesis and cell replication in cultured human fibroblasts, but the cellular alteration responsible for this effect was not fully defined. Using an assay for cellular sensitivity to Sm-C based on stimulation of uptake of the amino acid analog aminoisobutyric acid, a 20-h preincubation with 100 nM dexamethasone was found to enhance both the sensitivity and the maximal responsiveness of human fibroblasts to a 3-h incubation with Sm-C. This effect was found using fibroblasts from multiple normal donors of different ages, and dexamethasone was approximately 10-fold more potent than hydrocortisone. The glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 (100 nM) largely reversed the enhancing effect of 100 nM dexamethasone on Sm-C action. Binding of [125I]Sm-C to intact fibroblast monolayers or trypsin-dispersed cells could be increased by 60-80% by glucocorticoid preincubation, and this increase correlated well with enhanced stimulation of [3H]aminoisobutyric acid uptake, suggesting that the enhancement of Sm-C action in glucocorticoid-treated cells may be mediated at the level of the Sm-C receptor.\r"

  ".W": "To clone and characterize antigens to autoantibodies in Hashimoto's thyroiditis we constructed a cDNA library in the expression vector lambda gt11 using mRNA prepared from Grave's thyroid tissue. This library was screened using serum from a patient with Hashimoto's thyroiditis which had an antimicrosomal antibody titer greater than 1:10(6). Five positive recombinants were identified and cloned. Of these, 3 reacted with 7 of 17 normal serum samples. The 2 other clones (IL-28 and IL-33) reacted with none of the 17 normal serum samples. IL-28 reacted with 4 of 15 and IL-33 with 2 of 15 Hashimoto's thyroiditis serum samples (antimicrosomal antibody titers, greater than 1:6400). The specificity of the interaction between the Hashimoto's thyroiditis samples and the fusion protein was demonstrated by Western blot analysis. In addition, neither 10(-6) M human thyroglobulin nor 100 mU/ml bovine TSH inhibited binding of the serum samples to these 2 clones. Lysate from clones IL-28 and IL-33 did not reduce the antimicrosomal antibody titer in a hemagglutination assay. Absorption of Hashimoto's thyroiditis serum with purified thyroid microsomes reduced the serum antimicrosomal antibody titer, but not binding to these 2 clones. The cDNA inserts of clones IL-28 and IL-33 were approximately 0.6 and 0.4 kilobases (kb), respectively. The 0.6-kb IL-28 insert was used to probe human thyroid and human liver poly(A)+ mRNA. A single band of 3.3 kb was evident only with the thyroid mRNA. The IL-28 insert was subcloned into M13 and sequenced in both directions by the dideoxy technique and found to be 572 basepairs in length. When tested against the GenBank and Dayhoff gene banks, no significant homology with any known sequence was determined. In summary, a cDNA fragment of a previously unrecognized gene coding for an autoimmune thyroid disease-related antigen has been cloned and partly characterized; and the protein produced by this clone is not thyroglobulin, the thyroid microsomal antigen, or the TSH-binding site of the TSH receptor. We have, therefore, identified a new autoimmune thyroid disease-related antigen, the pathogenetic significance of which remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "The impaired epinephrine and glucagon responses to hypoglycemia often found in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) may be due to autonomic neuropathy. Since the pancreatic polypeptide response to hypoglycemia is mediated by cholinergic mechanisms, we used this response as an indicator of autonomic neuropathy to determine whether deficient epinephrine and glucagon responses in IDDM could be ascribed to an autonomic defect. The relationships between pancreatic polypeptide, epinephrine, and glucagon responses during insulin-induced hypoglycemia were assessed in 18 patients with IDDM who had no overt evidence of autonomic neuropathy, including normal standard cardiovascular reflex tests, and 11 age-matched nondiabetic subjects. All of the diabetic patients had impaired glucagon responses [19 +/- 3 (SEM) vs. 96 +/- 11 pg/ml, peak increment, P less than 0.001]. Ten of the 18 diabetic patients had either impairment of plasma epinephrine or plasma pancreatic polypeptide responses or both to hypoglycemia. Moreover, pancreatic polypeptide responses were significantly correlated with epinephrine responses (r = 0.53, P less than 0.003). There was no association between the plasma glucagon response and the epinephrine (r = 0.02, NS), norepinephrine (r = 0.03, NS), or pancreatic polypeptide (r = 0.35, NS) response. Last, there was no correlation between the plasma hormone responses and the cardiovascular reflex test results. Therefore, the association of impaired plasma pancreatic polypeptide responses with impaired plasma epinephrine responses suggests that the impaired epinephrine responses are due to autonomic neuropathy, whereas the dissociation of plasma glucagon responses with both plasma pancreatic polypeptide and epinephrine responses suggests that the impaired pancreatic alpha-cell response to hypoglycemia is not due to autonomic neuropathy. In addition, the plasma pancreatic polypeptide and epinephrine responses to hypoglycemia appear to be an earlier indicator of underlying autonomic dysfunction than standard cardiovascular reflex tests. Thus, the responses of plasma pancreatic polypeptide and epinephrine to insulin-induced hypoglycemia may be a useful test for the identification of early autonomic neuropathy in IDDM.\r"

  ".U": "87138165\r", 
  ".W": "Aromatase activity (AR) was studied in pubic skin fibroblasts from eight patients with isolated gynecomastia (PSFG) and five normal subjects (PSFC). Cell monolayers were incubated in the presence of [3H]androstenedione (2 nM) for 4 or 24 h. Culture medium was extracted after addition of [14C] carriers to monitor recovery. Metabolites were separated by two successive chromatographic steps. Estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) were characterized by crystallization, the other metabolites: 16-hydroxyestrone (16 alpha-OHE1) estriol (E3), and epiestriol (epiE3) by their chromatographic migration. AR was expressed either as femtomoles of E2 per microgram DNA (ARE2) or as total aromatized metabolites (ART = E1 + E2 + 16 alpha-OHE1 + E3 + epiE3/microgram DNA). After 4 h of incubation, no ARE2 could be measured in PSFC; it was low but significant in PSFG (0.03 +/- 0.02 (SEM) fmol/microgram DNA, P less than 0.01). The difference in ART was even more striking: 0.28 +/- 0.1 fmol/microgram DNA in PSFC, 3.15 +/- 2.88 in PSFG (P less than 0.05). 16 alpha-OHE1 represented in this latter group 62.5% of total aromatized metabolites vs. 39% in PSFC. After 24 h, ART was 4.17 +/- 3.70 and 1.02 +/- 0.42 fmol/microgram DNA in PSFG and PSFC, respectively (P less than 0.05); E3 + epiE3 represented 50% of the metabolites in both groups. In conclusion, AR is increased in PSFG relative to PSFC and an important oxidative metabolism of estrogens exists in both types of cells. This increased peripheral AR could result in increased formation of estrogens at the target cell site and represent an element of androgen-estrogen imbalance which would favor the development of gynecomastia.\r"

We recently discovered a placental variant of human growth hormone (hPGH), which appears in maternal serum at mid-pregnancy and which rises in concentration thereafter to term. As hPGH and GH-V proteins display very similar characteristics, including a high affinity for hepatic GH receptors, they could be identical. To verify this hypothesis, we sought hGH-V mRNA in placenta. Hybridization experiments were performed between dot-blotted mRNA originating either from placenta or from one pituitary hGH secreting adenoma and synthetic polynucleotide probes corresponding to specific portions of the hGH-V or hGH-N gene sequences. The results indicate that the V gene is indeed expressed in the placenta and, at a very low level, in the pituitary adenoma. Therefore hPGH is most likely the expression product of the hGH-V gene.\r"

Twice weekly blood samples were also obtained from the postpartum group. Ovulation was inferred by a significant rise in LH and PdG, and reversal of the E2G to PdG ratio. Luteal phase PdG excretion was measured by the peak of smoothed PdG levels and the area under the smoothed luteal phase PdG curve. The lower limits of normal established in 16 cycling women were a peak luteal phase PdG of 4 micrograms/ml and an area under the PdG curve of 20 micrograms/ml. In the postpartum women, 32% of first cycles were anovulatory, and among ovulatory cycles, 73% had abnormally low luteal phase PdG excretion or short luteal phases. In second and subsequent cycles, 15% were anovulatory and 26% had luteal phase abnormalities. There was a progressive increase in luteal PdG excretion from the first to third cycles. The mean delay before first ovulation was 45.2 days, and no woman ovulated before 25 days after delivery. The correlations between blood and urinary hormone levels were 0.78 for PdG, 0.65 for E2G, and 0.55 for LH. We conclude that assays of daily early morning urine samples provide reliable information on ovulation and luteal phase adequacy, and that there is gradual recovery of pituitary ovarian function after parturition.\r"

The biological function of the complexed fraction is unknown. To test the hypothesis that complexed hGH may have different in vivo kinetics than free hGH, we compared the MCRs, distribution volumes (Vd), and degradation rates of complexed and free [125I] hGH in the rat. A partially purified GH-binding protein preparation, generated by affinity chromatography on a hGH column, was used for this purpose. A mixture of hGH with binding protein (equivalent to the amount contained in 0.9 mL human plasma) was injected iv as a single dose. Parallel experiments were conducted with hGH in the absence of binding protein. Disappearance of total, immunoprecipitable, and trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity from rat plasma was followed, and MCR, Vd, and degradation rates were derived by standard mathematical techniques. The MCR was 6-fold slower for complexed than for free hGH (2.3 vs. 14 mL/min X kg), Vd was 4-fold smaller for complexed hGH than for free hGH (71 vs. 256 mL/kg), and initial degradation rate was 4.5-fold lower for complexed than for free hGH (13.2% vs. 59.9%/15 min). The Vd of complexed hGH was close to the intravascular volume, while the Vd for free hGH corresponded to the extracellular volume. We conclude that one function of the hGH-binding protein is relative confinement of hGH to the vascular compartment, thereby protecting it from degradation and prolonging its biological half-life.\r"

All three men had low plasma gonadotropin and testosterone levels and increased estradiol levels. Impairment of testicular steroidogenesis was also suggested by increased progesterone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione ratios in both spermatic venous plasma and the medium of Leydig tumor cells from one patient incubated in vitro. Before surgery, spermatogenesis was abnormal in two men. Testicular endocrine function and spermatogenesis did not return to normal after surgery. During the follow-up period, plasma gonadotropin levels were high in all three men, and testosterone was low normal. Estradiol levels decreased to normal immediately after surgery and then returned to the upper normal limit. The response to hCG stimulation in one man was subnormal. We conclude that chronic hyperestrogenism produced hypothalamo-pituitary inhibition as well as direct steroidogenic blockade at the testicular level. Long term impairment of both endocrine and exocrine testicular functions may be secondary to slowly reversible (or irreversible) estrogen-induced damage to tubular and Leydig cells.\r"

In 17 human pheochromocytomas from 11 patients, we found a remarkably wide distribution in immunoreactive adrenorphin levels (3-7771 pg/mg tissue). Adrenomedullary pheochromocytomas contained a significantly larger amount of immunoreactive adrenorphin (2295 +/- 1092 pg/mg, mean +/- SE) than did extramedullary ones (17.8 +/- 8.4 pg/mg). Gel chromatographic studies revealed that immunoreactive adrenorphin consisted largely of material emerging at the position of synthetic adrenorphin in both pheochromocytoma and normal adrenal medulla tissue. Nicotine (10(-5) M) significantly stimulated the secretion of immunoreactive adrenorphin as well as catecholamines from cultured human pheochromocytoma cells. Adrenorphin was a more potent inhibitor of catecholamine secretion evoked by 10(-5) M nicotine than was met-enkephalin in cultured human pheochromocytoma cells. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were 1.1 X 10(-6) and 6.5 X 10(-5) M for adrenorphin and met-enkephalin, respectively. The effect of adrenorphin was much the same as that of dynorphin-(1-13) (IC50, 1.0 X 10(-6) M) and BAM-12P (IC50, 4.5 X 10(-6) M). These results indicate the presence and secretion of adrenorphin in human pheochromocytomas. Adrenorphin may play an important role in regulating catecholamine secretion in human pheochromocytoma.\r"

  ".W": "Renin and angiotensin II (AII) have been demonstrated in the mammalian central nervous system, and AII has been found to promote PRL release in the rat and monkey. We added AII to monolayer cultures of human anterior pituitary cells and found significant PRL release by 30 min with concentrations of AII as low as 10(-10) M. This AII-induced PRL release was inhibited by the specific AII antagonist saralasin. AII-induced PRL release was a calcium-dependent process, since the calcium channel blockers verapamil and nifedipine as well as the calcium-calmodulin antagonist R2471 significantly inhibited AII-induced PRL release. Prostaglandins E2, A2, and F2 alpha also inhibited AII-induced PRL release. The significance of this latter observation is not clear, however, as indomethacin, an inhibitor of the cyclo-oxygenase prostaglandin metabolic pathway, had no effect on AII-induced PRL release. In light of recent immunohistochemical evidence of the presence of renin, angiotensinogen, and converting enzyme in human lactotrophs, our data support the concept that AII may be an important autocrine regulator of PRL secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The natural course of Graves' disease results in hypothyroidism in up to 20% of patients previously treated with antithyroid drugs. The precise mechanisms are not known, although autoimmune destruction of thyroid tissue has been proposed. We studied sequentially obtained serum samples from three patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease previously treated with an antithyroid drug who became hypothyroid to determine possible causes of their hypothyroidism. Antithyroglobulin and antithyroid microsomal autoantibodies, TSH binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII), thyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb), and thyroid stimulation-blocking activity were measured. Autoantibodies were markedly elevated throughout the clinical course in all three patients. Patient 1 had no TBII and blocking activity and extremely high TSAb when she was euthyroid as well as hypothyroid. Hypothyroidism was probably the result of autoimmune thyroid destruction. In patient 2, TSAb disappeared, and TBII and blocking activity increased markedly when she developed hypothyroidism, which thus appeared to result from blocking antibodies. Patient 3 had intermittent periods of hyper- and hypothyroidism before becoming and remaining euthyroid. While initially hypothyroid, TBII was weakly positive, and TSAb was strongly positive; subsequently, when hyperthyroidism recurred, TBII and TSAb were strongly positive. Hypothyroidism appeared to result from focal autoimmune thyroiditis. Patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease may develop hypothyroidism later by different means. Autoimmune thyroiditis, diffuse or focal, with thyroid destruction is one mechanism. The appearance of antibodies that block TSH stimulation may be another.\r"

Among potentially confounding variables, a strong positive association was found between estradiol levels and cigarette use, while testosterone and SHBG correlated negatively with percent body fat and alcohol intake. After adjustment for smoking, percent body fat, and alcohol, plasma estradiol levels correlated negatively with total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and testosterone levels correlated positively with apolipoprotein B, while SHBG levels correlated positively with HDL2 mass and apolipoprotein A-I. SHBG was also strongly associated with the waist to hip girth ratio (WHR). Adjustment for WHR eliminated the significant associations of SHBG with triglycerides, HDL2 mass, and apolipoprotein A-I. SHBG levels and WHR may reflect tissue sensitivity and the impact of exposure to fluctuating levels of sex hormones for a period of days, or longer. These variables may provide more insight into the role of sex hormones in lipoprotein metabolism than do single samples of circulating hormones. It is also suggested that long term effects of sex hormones on adipose tissue distribution may at least partially underlie sex-related differences in lipoprotein metabolism.\r"

Since the liver is a potential target tissue of these hormones during fetal life, we characterized the hepatic receptors for Sm-C/insulin like growth factor I (Sm-C/IGF-I) and insulin during the second trimester of human fetal development. Membrane-enriched fetal liver homogenates specifically bound 8.9 +/- 1.5% (+/- SD) of added [125I]insulin and 5.1-7.2% of [125I]Sm-C/IGF-I. Binding of both hormones was constant from 12-20 weeks gestation and was much greater than that in adult liver membranes. Analysis of dose-response data indicated high affinity between each receptor and its respective ligand (Kd for the Sm-C/IGF-I receptor, 2.2 X 10(-10) M; Kd for insulin receptor, 5.2 X 10(-10) and 7.7 X 10(-9) M). Limited cross-reactivity (approximately 1:1,000) of insulin with the Sm-C/IGF-I receptor and Sm-C/IGF-I with the insulin receptor was found. Affinity labeling studies showed that each receptor possessed an approximately 135,000-dalton subunit which was a part of a larger disulfide-linked complex. Thus, the human fetal liver has specific receptors for Sm-C/IGF-I and insulin that are similar to those described for other tissues in terms of both hormone-binding characteristics and subunit structure, suggesting that these receptors mediate important cellular functions at this stage of fetal development.\r"

Sudden cardiac death occurs in diabetic patients who have autonomic neuropathy, but the cause is uncertain. In 30 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who had no evidence of ischemic heart disease, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, determined by clinical tests, was found in 17. The corrected QT interval (QTc), measured using Bazett's formula at rest and peak exercise, was prolonged (greater than 440 msec) in 12 of these patients at rest and in 15 at peak exercise. Prolonged QTc intervals were found only in patients who had definite cardiac autonomic neuropathy. As a group, the QTc interval (mean +/- SD) in the diabetic patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy was prolonged compared to that in patients without cardiac autonomic neuropathy at rest (447 +/- 28 vs. 405 +/- 9 ms; P less than 0.0001) and peak exercise (468 +/- 23 vs. 402 +/- 23 ms; P less than 0.0001). There was a direct linear relationship between the extent of cardiac autonomic neuropathy and the QTc interval (r = 0.71; P less than 0.001). One of the patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy and prolonged QTc intervals had a nonuniform loss of adrenergic neurons in his heart demonstrated by meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine scintigraphy, indicating sympathetic imbalance; he subsequently died unexpectedly. These data suggest that diabetic cardiac autonomic neuropathy may result in sympathetic imbalance and QTc interval prolongation, predisposing these patients to sudden arrhythmias and death.\r"

  ".W": "The pattern of pulsatile GnRH secretion is abnormal in some women with hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) consequent to previous exercise or weight loss. Both diminished frequency pulsatile LH secretion, and by inference GnRH secretion, and normal LH pulsatility have been reported. We assessed whether the patterns of GnRH secretion varied with time by measuring plasma LH every 15 or 20 min for 24 h on 1-3 occasions during a 10-month period in 14 women with HA (a total of 24 studies). During the day, mean LH pulse frequency [1.0 +/- 0.1 (+/- SE) pulses/8 h] was lower than that in normal women in the early follicular phase of their cycles (5.1 +/- 0.6), and the frequency in individual HA patients was lower than early follicular phase values in 16 of 17 studies. The slow daytime LH pulse frequency also was a consistent finding, in that the values in repeat studies varied by less than 2 pulses/8 h in all but 1 patient. LH pulse frequency (2.0 +/- 0.4 pulses/8 h) was higher and more variable during sleep, and normal early follicular phase frequencies were found in 20% of patients with HA. The mechanisms whereby GnRH pulse frequency is reduced are not known. alpha-Adrenergic agonist drugs stimulate GnRH pulsatile secretion in rodents, but administration of the alpha 2-agonist clonidine (0.15 mg, orally, at 0800 and 2000 h) did not increase the frequency of LH pulses in 7 women (1.7 +/- 0.4 pulses/8 h). In contrast, administration of naloxone (1 mg/m2 X h, iv) for 8 h during the day to 14 patients, increased LH pulse frequency (3.3 +/- 0.5 pulses/8 h). In 8 of these 14 women, LH pulse frequency (4.9 +/- 0.4 pulses/8 h) increased into the range found during the normal early follicular phase, while in the other 6 women pulse frequency was not significantly increased (1.4 +/- 0.4 pulses/8 h). Plasma estradiol levels were similar in naloxone-responsive and unresponsive women, but spontaneous LH pulse frequency was higher at night in naloxone-responsive patients (2.9 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.3 pulses/8 h). The presence of nocturnal LH pulses did not predict responsiveness to naloxone, however, and LH pulse frequency was less than 2 pulses/8 h in 4 of the women who responded to naloxone. These data indicate that slow frequency GnRH secretion is a common finding during the day in women with HA. GnRH secretion is more variable at night, suggesting that the mechanisms involved in reducing pulsatile GnRH secretion are less effective during sleep.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The variability of the surge-initiating serum E2 level in individual women from cycle to cycle, however, has not been studied. Accordingly, we studied 24 normally ovulating women longitudinally during a total of 221 menstrual cycles (range, 4-17 cycles/woman). In those women we measured periovulatory serum E2 and LH concentrations daily from 3 days before the LH peak to the day after the LH peak. The mean peak E2 concentration was 343 pg/mL, and the mean E2 dose (concentration X time) was 979 pg/mL. When the values in individual women were compared between women by components of variance analysis of variance, the differences were significant (concentration, P less than 0.01; dose, P less than 0.005), indicating that individual women have discrete and characteristic responses to E2 positive feedback. When E2 peaks and doses from initial cycles were compared with subsequent cycles by regression analysis, there were strong positive correlations (peak: r = 0.47; P less than 0.001; dose: r = 0.60; P less than 0.001). Of the total group variance in mean E2 peak and mean dose, 67% of the peak and 54% of the dose variance resulted from an individual woman's cycle to cycle variability, while 33% of the peak and 46% of the dose variance was attributable to differences among the women's responses to positive feedback. We conclude that individual women have characteristic and predictable periovulatory E2 production, leading to a LH surge which is maintained from cycle to cycle; and approximately two thirds of the total variance in mean peak E2 concentration (67%) and approximately half the variance in mean dose (54%) are the result of cycle to cycle biological variability around this characteristic periovulatory pattern of E2 production.\r"

The mean (+/- SD) MCR and blood production rate of DIT were 122 +/- 29 L/day X 70 kg and 24.2 +/- 12.7 nmol/day X 70 kg (10.5 micrograms/day X 70 kg), respectively, in 10 normal subjects. Urinary DIT was measured by RIA after its immunoprecipitation from urine. Acid hydrolysis had no effect on measured urinary DIT concentrations, suggesting the presence of predominantly unconjugated DIT. Mean urinary DIT excretion was 1.23 +/- 0.43 (+/- SD) nmol/24 h (533 ng/24 h) or 0.108 +/- 0.048 nmol/nmol creatinine in 32 normal individuals. In patients with defective thyroidal iodine metabolism, urinary DIT was extremely elevated, ranging from 1.2-17.7 nmol/mmol creatinine. Comparison of normal production and excretion rates suggests that about 5% of the daily extrathyroidal DIT turnover is excreted in the urine unchanged or in a DIT-like form.\r"

The secretion of SHBG also was stimulated by the antiestrogen tamoxifen, although this required the use of longer incubation periods and higher concentrations than were required for the steroids. The antiandrogen cyproterone acetate and cortisol (5 microM) decreased SHBG secretion. Pregnanediol (5 microM) had no discernible effect. These changes were considered specific as none of the compounds altered either the secretion of total protein by the cells or their total protein content. Cells incubated with a mixture of E2 (0.5 microM) and T (0.5 microM) secreted significantly more SHBG than did cells incubated with E2 (1.0 microM), indicating these steroids exert their effects through different mechanisms. The increases with E2 and T were reduced significantly by tamoxifen and cyproterone acetate, respectively, suggesting receptor mediation of the steroid effects. The E2-related increase was abolished by cycloheximide, indicating that the changes were due to alterations in the synthesis of SHBG rather than to alterations in the release of previously synthesized protein. These findings suggest the T-related decrease in plasma SHBG levels may be due to causes other than a decrease in the hepatic synthesis of the protein. Additionally, they indicate that Hep G2 cells may prove suitable for examining the regulation of the SHBG gene by a variety of compounds.\r"

There were no significant changes in the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin LD or vitamin D-binding protein levels from the pre- to the postmenopausal period.

Whereas there were significant increases in serum cortisol levels and urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion soon after thermal injury, there were significant decreases in serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, and testosterone concentrations during the first 4 weeks following burn trauma. Serum androstenediol and androstenediol sulfate levels also were reduced, though insignificantly, 10-23 days postburn. Serum LH levels were unchanged during the postburn interval. Since urinary 17-ketosteroid excretion was normal or below normal rather than increased, the decline in serum C19-steroid levels probably resulted from decreased glandular secretion rather than increased rates of metabolism and excretion. Low dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and/or testosterone levels were found in some men several months after recovery from their burns. These data suggest that thermal injury leads to acute inhibition of adrenal and testicular C19-steroid secretion, but stimulation of adrenal glucocorticosteroid production, and that endocrine function in many instances is not normalized after complete healing of the burned surfaces. The mechanisms and physiological consequences of such changes in the steroid milieu of men after burn trauma are unknown.\r"

All patients were considered clinically euthyroid. TSH secretion was assessed by iv TRH stimulation testing. The T4 dose associated with an undetectable basal serum TSH level and no increase in serum TSH after TRH administration (suppressive dose) averaged 2.7 +/- 0.4 (SD) micrograms/kg body weight (BW)/day in athyreotic patients and 2.1 +/- 0.3 micrograms/kg BW/day in goitrous patients (P less than 0.001). The 25th-75th percentile intervals were 2.5-2.9 micrograms/kg BW/day for athyreotic patients and 1.9-2.3 micrograms/kg BW/day for goitrous patients. The suppressive dose of T4 was dependent in both groups on patient age, younger patients needing higher doses than older patients. The duration of treatment also proved to be an important parameter, since in both groups the percentage of patients with suppressed TSH secretion increased if TRH testing was carried out after at least 6 months after the initiation of therapy. Serum total T4, total T3, free T3 (FT3), free T4 (FT4) index, and FT3 index values did not differ in the two groups and were significantly higher (P less than 0.001) than in normal subjects. Mean serum FT4 was significantly higher in athyreotic patients than in goitrous patients with suppressed TSH secretion. Among athyreotic patients with suppressed TSH secretion, 24% had elevated serum FT4 and FT3, and 47% had elevated serum FT4 alone. Of goitrous patients with suppressed TSH secretion, 20% had elevated serum FT4 and FT3, and 27% had elevated serum FT4 alone. On the other hand, 35% of athyreotic patients and 14% of goitrous patients whose TSH secretion was not suppressed had elevated serum FT4. Serum sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations were measured in 3 groups of goitrous women. Values above normal limits were found in 13/26 patients (50%) with high serum FT4 and FT3, in 4/30 patients (13%) with elevated serum FT4 alone, and in 1/25 patients (4%) with normal FT4 and FT3. In conclusion: TSH suppression requires daily doses of T4 between 2.5 and 2.9 micrograms/kg BW in athyreotic patients and between 1.9 and 2.3 micrograms/kg BW in goitrous patients, with appropriate adjustments in relation to the age of the patient; Assessment of the adequacy of treatment should not be carried out before 6 months after the institution of therapy.\r"

Melatonin suppresses steroidogenesis by ovarian granulosa and luteal cells in vitro. To determine if melatonin is present in the human ovary, preovulatory follicular fluids (n = 32) from 15 women were assayed for melatonin by RIA after solvent extraction. The fluids were obtained by laparoscopy or sonographically controlled follicular puncture from infertile women undergoing in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. All patients had received clomiphene citrate, human menopausal gonadotropin, and hCH to stimulate follicle formation. Blood samples were obtained by venipuncture 30 min or less after follicular aspiration. All of the follicular fluids contained melatonin, in concentrations [36.5 +/- 4.8 (+/- SEM) pg/mL] substantially higher than those in the corresponding serum (10.0 +/- 1.4 pg/mL). A positive correlation was found between follicular fluid and serum melatonin levels in each woman (r = 0.770; P less than 0.001). These observations indicate that preovulatory follicles contain substantial amounts of melatonin that may affect ovarian steroidogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Free-flow micropuncture experiments were performed to examine ammonia transport separately in early and late proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) of the rat. In control rats, ammonia was secreted along the early PCT but was reabsorbed along the late PCT. In rats with chronic metabolic acidosis, ammonia secretion along the early PCT was increased compared with controls, and ammonia absorption by the late PCT was converted to small net ammonia secretion. In the acidotic rats, ammonia secretion rate in the early PCT was six times higher than that in the late PCT. Thus, most or all of ammonia secretion by the PCT occurred along its early portion. In control and acidotic rats, luminal NH3 concentration in the early PCT was significantly higher than that in the late PCT, indicating that ammonia is not in diffusion equilibrium throughout the renal cortex. It is proposed that differences in ammonia transport rate in early vs. late PCT may be due to differences in ammonia production rate and/or to differences in the rate of an ammonia backflux that detracts from net ammonia secretion.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effects of the antifolate methotrexate on intracellular folate pools of human myeloid precursor cells (MPCs). Immature MPCs, representing 3.2% of the original marrow population, were selected from normal human bone marrow by immune rosetting. The intracellular folate pools were labeled by incubation with 5 X 10(-8) M [3H]5-formyl-FH4 and were quantitated by high performance liquid chromatography. The predominant folates were 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-FH4) (36%), 10-formyl-FH4 (41.4%), 5-formyl-FH4 (12.3%), and FH4 (10.3%). A 12-h exposure to 1 microM methotrexate (MTX) resulted in a 34% reduction in the intracellular concentration of 10-formyl-FH4, a 61% decrease in 5-formyl-FH4, and a 62% decrease in 5-methyl-FH4, as well as the appearance and progressive expansion of the FH2 and 10-formyl-FH2 pools. These changes were maximal after 4 h of incubation with MTX. Paralleling the changes in folates, particularly the increase in FH2, were a 64% reduction in myeloid colony formation and a 77% depression of de novo purine synthesis after 4 h of MTX. We conclude that MTX does not produce quantitative depletion of 10-formyl-FH4 and that its antipurine effect may be mediated by direct inhibition of de novo purine synthesis by FH2 and, at later time points, by MTX polyglutamates.\r"

The intracellular reduction of C1 INH in patients' monocytes approached 50%. The study of C1 INH messenger RNA (mRNA) by Northern blot analysis indicated that in HANE patients' monocytes a message of normal size is present at about half the concentration of that from normal cells. One of the patients analyzed showed the presence of a genetically inherited abnormal mRNA (1.9 kb) in addition to the normal mRNA (2.1 kb). Southern blot analysis of DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes did not show any difference in quantity or in sizes of endonuclease restriction fragments between patients and normals. The defect(s), therefore, in type I HANE is pretranslational, but is not due to a deletion or to a major chromosomal rearrangement.\r"

Cultured rabbit cortical collecting tubule (RCCT) cells, isolated by immunodissection, were treated with 5'-N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine (NECA), N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), and R-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA). All three analogs produced both dose-dependent inhibition and stimulation of RCCT cell cyclic AMP (cAMP) production. Stimulation of cAMP accumulation occurred at analog concentrations of 0.1 microM to 100 microM with the rank order of potency NECA greater than PIA greater than CHA. Inhibition occurred at concentrations of 1 nM to 1 microM with the rank order of potency CHA greater than PIA greater than NECA. These effects on cAMP production were inhibited by 1,3-diethyl-8-phenylxanthine and isobutylmethylxanthine. CHA (50 nM) blunted AVP- and isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation. This modulation of hormone-induced cAMP production was abolished by pretreatment of RCCT cells with pertussis toxin. Prostaglandin E2 production was unaffected by 0.1 mM CHA. These findings indicate the presence of both inhibitory (A1) and stimulatory (A2) receptors for adenosine in RCCT cells. Moreover, occupancy of the A1 receptor causes inhibition of both basal and hormone-stimulated cAMP formation through an action on the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component, Ni, of the adenylate cyclase system.\r"

Until now, evidence seemed to point to relatively low circulating levels of parathyroid hormone as a contributing factor, but because levels of parathyroid hormone and calcitriol are interrelated, calcitriol might be also involved. In this study we employed an animal model to evaluate the single and combined effects of parathyroid hormone and calcitriol on bone aluminum accumulation. The results show significantly less aluminum accumulation in calcitriol-replete dogs independent of the presence or absence of parathyroid hormone. These results indicate that low levels of calcitriol may play a role in the development of aluminum related bone disease. Further studies are needed to demonstrate whether administration of calcitriol in patients with renal insufficiency will prevent development of aluminum-related bone disease.\r"

Patients with SLE has a markedly decreased percentage of T4+2H4+ cells (13 +/- 2%) in their PBL compared with normal controls (21 +/- 1%) (P less than 0.001). This reduction was greatest in patients with active SLE, especially those with renal disease. Serial analysis of patients with SLE and renal disease showed a correlation between percent positive circulating T4+2H4+ cells and disease activity. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between a low percentage of T4+2H4+ cells and decreased suppressor-inducer function in autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction-activated T4+ cells from SLE patients. Thus, a deficiency exists in SLE patients with active renal disease in the T4+2H4+ suppressor-inducer T cell subset.\r"

Computerized analysis of the plasma LH time series revealed a significant decrease in LH pulse frequency within 24 h of estrogen treatment, followed by a secondary increase (days 5 and 10), and then a sustained decline (day 30) in LH pulsatility. Estradiol also significantly suppressed incremental and maximal (but not fractional) LH pulse amplitudes in a biphasic manner. In contrast, LH peak duration was invariant until day 30 of estradiol replacement. These observations indicate that the well recognized biphasic actions of estradiol on mean serum LH concentrations can be modeled in relation to specific and time-dependent alterations in LH pulse frequency and amplitude.\r"

Some pentameric IgM RFs are marked by crossreactive idiotypes (RCRI) defined by prototypic monoclonal RFs. In previous studies, we observed that a proportion of pokeweed mitogen (PWM) induced plasma cells from RA patients' blood lymphocytes express the major RCRI as assayed by indirect immunofluorescence with polyclonal anti-RCRI antibodies. In this study, 7S IgM obtained from three different RF+ RA patients inhibits specific anti-RCRI intracytoplasmic staining of PWM induced RF+ RA-derived plasma cells. These 7S molecules also block polyclonal anti-RCRI antibodies from reacting with red blood cells bearing 7S IgM molecules from RF+ patients with RA or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. We conclude that some 7S IgM molecules in the serum of RF+ RA patients are marked by the major RCRI idiotype and are related to 19S monoclonal and polyclonal RFs.\r"

We radiolabeled the adenine nucleotide pool with [8-14C]adenine and examined purine nucleotide degradation after intravenous fructose. The cumulative excretion of radioactivity during a 5-d period was 9.7% and 9.1% of infused radioactivity in the enzyme-deficient patients and 6.0 +/- 0.7% (mean +/- SE) in four normal subjects. Fructose infusion increased urinary radioactivity to 7.96 and 9.16 X 10(6) cpm/g creatinine in both patients and to 4.73 +/- 0.69 X 10(6) cpm/g creatinine in controls. The infusion of fructose increased total urinary purine excretion to a mean of 487% from low-normal baseline values in the patients and to 398 +/- 86% in control subjects. In the enzyme-deficient patients, the infusion of fructose elicited an increase of plasma guanosine from undetectable values to 0.7 and 0.9 microM. With adjustments made for intestinal purine loss, these data support the hypothesis that there is enhanced hypoxanthine salvage in hereditary xanthinuria. Degradation of guanine nucleotides to xanthine bypasses the hypoxanthine salvage pathway and may explain the predominance of this urinary purine compound in xanthinuria.\r"

TSP mediates an adhesive interaction between thrombin-stimulated platelets and both U937 cells and human blood monocytes. Using a sensitive rosetting assay, we found that monocytes were not rosetted by resting platelets whereas greater than 90% were rosetted by thrombin-stimulated platelets. Monoclonal and polyclonal anti-TSP antibodies markedly inhibited rosetting as did TSP itself. Neither control antibodies nor heparin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, nor the fibronectin adhesion tetrapeptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser inhibited rosetting. TSP may thus serve as a molecular bridge linking activated platelets with monocytes at sites of early vascular injury. Such interaction may be of critical importance in the regulation of thrombosis and the initiation of atherosclerosis.\r"

To elucidate the mechanisms of this effect, we developed a method to culture isolated and enriched G cells from canine stomach. After digestion of antral mucosa with collagenase and EDTA, dispersed cells were fractionated by counterflow elutriation then cultured on a collagen support. Bombesin and three molecular forms of canine gastrin-releasing peptides all stimulated gastrin release from G cells in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of bombesin was suppressed by somatostatin and potentiated by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10(-3) M) but not by carbachol (10(-6) M). Extracellular calcium depletion attenuated the stimulation of gastrin release by bombesin but not by forskolin. These findings suggest that the bombesin family peptides directly activate G cells through calcium-dependent mechanisms to cause gastrin release.\r"

  ".W": "To explain the transient anemia and poikilocytosis seen during infancy in hereditary elliptocytosis (HE), we resealed erythrocyte (RBC) ghosts from affected children or their elliptocytic parents with 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) (0-8 mM), a compound that dissociates membrane skeletons, then measured ghost mechanical stability in the ektacytometer. Without added 2,3-DPG, ghost mechanical stability was subnormal in infantile poikilocytosis (IP) and HE but was even more abnormal in hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP). Addition of 2,3-DPG (2.55 mM) to IP or HE ghosts, decreased their stability to that of HPP ghosts (without 2,3-DPG). Nonphysiological 2,3-DPG levels (6-8 mM) were required to elicit a similar effect in normal ghosts. The data suggest that free 2,3-DPG, present in neonatal RBC as a consequence of diminished binding to HbF, may render HE susceptible to in vivo fragmentation. The developmental switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin, by diminishing available free 2,3-DPG, may explain the abatement of poikilocytosis and hemolytic anemia that accompanies maturation.\r"

  ".W": "Contractile dysfunction in stunned myocardium could result from a decrease in the intracellular free [Ca2+] transient during each beat, a decrease in maximal Ca2+-activated force, or a shift in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. We measured developed pressure (DP) at several [Ca]0 (0.5-7.5 mM) in isovolumic Langendorff-perfused ferret hearts at 37 degrees C after 15 min of global ischemia (stunned group, n = 13) or in a nonischemic control group (n = 6). At all [Ca]0, DP was depressed in the stunned group (P less than 0.001). Maximal Ca2+-activated pressure (MCAP), measured from tetani after exposure to ryanodine, was decreased after stunning (P less than 0.05). Normalization of the DP-[Ca]0 relationship by corresponding MCAP (Ca0 sensitivity) revealed a shift to higher [Ca]0 in stunned hearts. To test whether cellular Ca overload initiates stunning, we reperfused with low-[Ca]0 solution (0.1-0.5 mM; n = 8). DP and MCAP in the low-[Ca]0 group were comparable to control (P greater than 0.05), and higher than in the stunned group (P less than 0.05). Myocardial [ATP] observed by phosphorus NMR failed to correlate with functional recovery. In conclusion, contractile dysfunction in stunned myocardium is due to a decline in maximal force, and a shift in Ca0 sensitivity (which may reflect either decreased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity or a decrease in the [Ca2+] transient). Our results also indicate that calcium entry upon reperfusion plays a major role in the pathogenesis of myocardial stunning.\r"

Furthermore, the GP IIb-IIIa complexes showed an increased sensitivity to dissociation with EDTA, either after Triton X-100 solubilization or in the intact platelet membrane. For example, after incubation with EDTA at room temperature, the patient's platelets bound little of the monoclonal antibodies AP-2 or T10 (anti-GP IIb-IIIa complex) although normally binding Tab (anti-GP IIb). Patient C.M. appears to represent a subgroup of thrombasthenia where platelets contain unstable GP IIb-IIIa complexes unable to support fibrinogen binding.\r"

In this study, the levels of expression of the two isoforms (alpha and beta) of myosin heavy chain (MHC) during cardiac hypertrophy were investigated at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. In normal control and sham-operated rats, the alpha-MHC mRNA predominated in the ventricular myocardium. In response to aortic coarctation, there was a rapid induction of the beta-MHC mRNA followed by the appearance of comparable levels of the beta-MHC protein in parallel to an increase in the left ventricular weight. Administration of thyroxine to coarctated animals caused a rapid deinduction of beta-MHC and induction of alpha-MHC, both at the mRNA and protein levels, despite progression of left ventricular hypertrophy. These results suggest that the MHC isozyme transition during hemodynamic overload is mainly regulated by pretranslational mechanisms, and that a complex interplay exists between hemodynamic and hormonal stimuli in MHC gene expression.\r"

This novel red blood cell-membrane protein migrated to a position between the normal alpha- and beta-spectrin subunits in SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was identified as an alpha spectrin by its binding to anti-alpha spectrin antibodies, by the absence of a phosphorylation site, and by the normal 1:1 stoichiometry between total alpha- and beta-spectrin molecules. The quantity of the alpha-spectrin mutant, expressed as a percentage of the total alpha spectrin, varied from 9.9-45.2% among six affected individuals. Two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis of spectrin tryptic digests was qualitatively normal but showed a decreased quantity of a normal alpha IV fragment. The variable quantity of alpha-spectrin mutant among family members correlated directly with the increased percentage of spectrin dimers in cold low ionic strength spectrin extracts (r = 0.92) and inversely with red blood cell ghost mechanical stability (r = -0.98). The data suggest that this new alpha-spectrin mutant is responsible for decreased spectrin dimer-dimer association and for red cell instability in affected individuals.\r"

Accordingly, more than 18,000 serial sections in 10 stomachs with chronic ulcers were examined to clarify the histopathogenesis of the intestinal metaplasia. It was concluded from the three dimensional reconstruction of minute intestinal metaplasia lesions that these lesions originated during the regenerative process of healing of gastric erosions. The lesions were roughly globoid with a depression on the surface. It is thought that with continuous formation and healing of gastric erosions, more extensive intestinal metaplasia lesions would be formed by an increase in size and confluence of these focal minute intestinal metaplasia lesions.\r"

A further 14 patients with cerebrospinal fluid shunts but no abnormality in the cerebrospinal fluid provided a control group for alpha-interferon determinations. The group with viral meningitis and the group with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid had significantly higher alpha-interferon concentrations (p less than 0.001) when compared with those of the three other groups. This assay had great predictive value in determining those patients with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid who did not have a bacterial cause of meningitis.

There was no relation between mast cell density and age or the histological changes associated with aging of glomic tissue. The normal range of mast cell density calculated in terms of the 80% confidence limits was 18.5 to 67.5/mm2. In three middle aged subjects with carotid bodies of normal histological appearance there was an abnormally high density of 83 to 96/mm2. In two elderly subjects showing age changes of fibrosis and accumulation of lymphocytes there was an abnormally low density of 12/mm2 or less. Mast cell density was not related to different types of carotid body hyperplasia. The mast cells were essentially stromal in location, usually closely applied to the walls of small glomic blood vessels, and were rarely found in intimate association with glomic chief cells. This suggests that mast cells are not directly concerned with the functions of glomic cells but does not preclude the possibility that they may have some effect on regulating glomic blood vessels and thus participate in the distribution of blood supply within the carotid body.\r"

In all cases the necropsy comprised macroscopic findings and histological examination of all organs, with microbiology, radiology, and cytogenetics where appropriate. Clinically important differences between clinical and pathological diagnoses in 54 of 150 cases (36%) were noted in the cases of stillbirth. Of the neonatal deaths, examination showed clinically important information that had not been recognised during life in 66 cases (44%). Histological examination of tissues was essential for making or confirming the pathological diagnosis in 20% of all perinatal deaths.\r"

These axonal discontinuities were shown by using Nauomenko and Feigin's silver method, which is particularly useful for showing fine axons such as those found in the developing brain. Diffuse axonal injury in early infancy may occur in the same way as that described in adults. The low incidence of intracerebral haematomata suggests that recurrent trauma to the head from a combination of direct contact and shaking results in axonal damage to the poorly myelinated axons and that blood vessels are rarely damaged.\r"

Given that these bacteria are potentially harmful, that there can be extensive cross reaction between bacterial antigens and host tissues, and that the decisions are made in uncertainty, there is a finite chance of error in immune response leading to autoimmune disease. A model of ageing in the immune system is proposed that is based on random decay in components of the decision process, leading to a steep age dependent increase in the probability of error. The age incidence of those autoimmune diseases which peak in early and middle life can be explained as the resultant of two processes: an exponentially falling curve of incidence of first contact with common bacteria, and a rapidly rising error function. Epidemiological data on the variation of incidence with social class, sibship order, climate and culture can be used to predict the likely site of carriage and mode of spread of the causative bacteria. Furthermore, those autoimmune diseases precipitated by common viral respiratory tract infections might represent reactions to nasopharyngeal bacterial overgrowth, and this theory can be tested using monoclonal antibodies to search the bacterial isolates for cross reacting antigens. If this model is correct then prevention of autoimmune disease by early exposure to low doses of bacteria might be possible.\r"

Our patient also had a markedly decreased sweating response to methacholine.

Biopsy is necessary in order to establish a more accurate diagnosis of nail disease and thus administer more appropriate and effective therapy.\r"

Biopsy specimens from hyperpigmented skin revealed histologic and ultrastructural features typical of mycosis fungoides. Giant melanin granules were found in the tumor cells, as well as in keratinocytes and Langerhans cells. As far as we know, this is the first report of cutaneous hyperpigmentation as a single presenting sign of mycosis fungoides.\r"

Because the lesions were soft on palpation, the eruption was diagnosed clinically as an atypical localized linear epidermal nevus. Examination of a biopsy specimen of the lesion, however, revealed marked fibroblastic proliferation and pronounced dermal fibrosis, along with epidermal changes of hyperkeratosis, focal hypergranulosis, and papillomatosis. These findings are consistent with connective tissue nevus with epidermal changes suggestive of epidermal nevus. Therefore a deep biopsy is strongly suggested to rule out the possibility of connective tissue nevus in suspected cases of atypical linear epidermal nevus.\r"

In a comparative study with the use of morphometric analysis, conjugated avidin proved objectively to be as good as toluidine blue, and subjectively superior to this stain for mast cell identification in both human and murine skin.

The test sunscreens were Parsol 1789 (2%), Eusolex 8020 (2%), and oxybenzone (3%). UVA was obtained from two filtered xenon-arc sources. UVA protection factors were found to be significantly higher in sensitized skin compared with normal skin. Both Parsol and Eusolex provided better and comparable photoprotection (approximately 3.0) than oxybenzone (approximately 2.0) in sensitized skin, regardless of whether 8-methoxypsoralen or anthracene was used. In normal unsensitized skin, Parsol 1789 and Eusolex 8020 were also comparable and provided slightly better photoprotection (approximately 1.8) than oxybenzone (approximately 1.4) when pigmentation was used as an end point. The three sunscreens, however, were similar in providing photoprotection against UVA-induced erythema. Protection factors obtained in artificially sensitized skin are probably not relevant to normal skin. It is concluded that pigmentation, either immediate or delayed, is a reproducible and useful end point for the routine assessment of photoprotection of normal skin against UVA.\r"

These spores were not visible on surface inspection but became apparent only where the cuticle had been rubbed off or broken. Daily selenium sulfide shampoos removed all of the spores from these sites. The cuticle is viewed as being an effective barrier to the penetration of fungi, so that the hair is vulnerable to fungus infection only deep within the hair follicle below the level of the mature cuticle. Once the fungus enters the hair cortex just above the hair bulb, it produces myriads of spores that remain trapped and hidden beneath the cuticle for the length of the intact hair.\r"

Each color slide was digitized with a spatial reduction of 25 X 25 microns. Classic technics of digital image analysis and new algorithms were used to improve the contrast on the full image or a portion of it, contrast a skin lesion with statistical information deduced from another lesion, evaluate the shape of the lesion, the roughness of the surface, and the transition region from the lesion to the normal skin, and analyze a lesion from the chromatic point of view. The theoretical reasons of interest are to have an objective method that is easy to standardize and reliably repeatable and to be able to analyze details not perceivable by the human eye. If the same technic are used in the evaluation of histologic characteristics of the lesions, a chance of making much more sophisticated clinicopathologic correlations will be available. The system needs to be improved at the technical level so that the response time of acquisition of the digitized images is shortened by the use of a digital television camera and the development of new computer programs to be run on a small computer. Evaluation of the system's sensitivity and specificity and an adequate clinical trial are needed.\r"

Twenty-nine patients were available for complete follow-up lasting from 4 to 16 years after initiation of therapy. At the time of final evaluation, twenty-seven patients (93%) were alive; two deaths were unrelated to therapy; thirteen (45%) of the patients were free of disease and had not received treatment for up to 132 months; five of these patients had been off therapy for periods ranging from 60 to 132 months; eleven (38%) of the patients were clinically free of disease but still had low titers of antibodies and thus required low-dose maintenance therapy; five (17%) of the patients were well controlled but not completely free of disease. Side effects were rare and mostly related to corticosteroids. Of the original thirty-seven patients, only one death related to disease or therapy occurred and was due to pulmonary tuberculosis. It is concluded that azathioprine-corticosteroid treatment of pemphigus is highly effective and safe; it leads to long-term remissions in most patients and possibly to a cure in some.\r"

One hundred thirty-eight patients had systemic as well as cutaneous lesions, and fifty had cutaneous lesions only. All types of clinical lesions were seen among patients with cutaneous lesions only. The extent of cutaneous lesions did not correlate with the extent of systemic disease. Papular lesions were relatively uncommon and occurred as the only manifestation of the disease or were associated with hilar adenopathy and acute disease. Lupus pernio, scar infiltrates, and plaque lesions were the most common clinical lesions and were typically chronic and commonly associated with pulmonary mottling and/or fibrosis. Forty-eight of 127 had a histologically positive Kveim test. Among patients followed for more than 2 years, dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) sensitivity was higher among those with acute disease than among those with chronic disease. Seventy-nine patients with infiltrative cutaneous lesions were followed until the cutaneous lesions had healed. Those with lupus pernio were often left with unsightly telangiectatic scars, while the other types of lesions left either pale, slightly depressed scars or no scars at all.\r"

These cases are the first reported to occur in liver disease associated with primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, amyloidosis, and preeclampsia. Patch and intradermal skin tests demonstrated a hypersensitivity that seems to have an immune basis and is restricted to fat-soluble vitamin K1. This finding suggests that patients with any type of liver disease may be at risk for vitamin K hypersensitivity and that the hypersensitivity may be a marker of liver disease.\r"

We have studied eighty-nine patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and twenty-five normal control subjects. Clinical evidence of skin thickening (diabetic thick skin) was found in 22% of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and in 4% of control subjects (p less than 0.05). Full-thickness skin biopsy specimens were taken from the forearm of nine patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and diabetic thick skin, four patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and clinically normal skin, four patients with progressive systemic sclerosis, and four normal control subjects. The sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed increased thickness of the dermis of the forearm skin in all diabetic patients. In diabetic thick skin the collagen bundles were large, disorganized, and separated by clear spaces. Small amounts of acid mucopolysaccharides were present in the upper reticular dermis of five patients with diabetic thick skin. Electron microscopy of the dermis showed capillary basement membrane thickening in Groups 1, 2, and 3. All patients with diabetic thick skin showed active fibroblasts and extensive collagen polymerization in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Occasional collagen flowers were noted in all patients with diabetic thick skin. Measurements of 100 collagen fibers in the upper and lower reticular dermis of each biopsy specimen showed predominance of large fibers (greater than 60 nm) in Groups 1 and 2. Unlike scleroderma, diabetic thick skin resulted in small fiber sizes (less than 60 nm) only rarely, and bimodality of fiber sizes was not seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients were otherwise healthy and serum testosterone levels were within normal limits. A control group of men of similar age without hair loss had lower dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels ranging from 124 to 300 micrograms/dl (p less than 0.005). The biochemistry of androgens, particularly dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, suggests that adrenal hyperactivity may initiate alopecia in young men who are genetically susceptible.\r"

Seventy-five percent of black male patients had at least one pigmentary demarcation line, with type C being most prevalent.

The median age of the screened participants was 59 years, with actinic keratosis (62%) the most common referral diagnosis. Referrals for presumptive clinical diagnoses of basal cell carcinomas and malignant melanomas numbered 28% and 8%, respectively. Through the support of the local media and a central organized format, local skin cancer detection programs can successfully screen large numbers of participants. These examinations provide maximum visibility for dermatologists while meeting the primary goals of early disease detection and enhancing public awareness of skin cancer and the harmful effects of actinic radiation.\r"

  ".W": "Controversy has arisen concerning whether gender influences the prognosis after myocardial infarction. Although some studies have shown there to be no difference between the sexes, most have indicated a worse prognosis for women, attributing this to differences in baseline characteristics. It has been further suggested that black women have a particularly poor prognosis after infarction. To determine the contribution of gender and race to the course of infarction, 816 patients with confirmed myocardial infarction who were enrolled in the Multicenter Investigation of the Limitation of Infarct Size (MILIS) were analyzed. Of those patients, 226 were women and 590 were men, 142 were black and 674 were white. The cumulative mortality rate at 48 months was 36% for women versus 21% for men (p less than 0.001, mean follow-up 32 months). The cumulative mortality rate by race was 34% for blacks versus 24% for whites (p less than 0.005). Both women and blacks exhibited more baseline characteristics predictive of mortality than did their male or white counterparts. It was possible to account for the greater mortality rate of blacks by identifiable baseline variables; however, even after adjustment, the mortality rate for women remained significantly higher (p less than 0.002). The poorer prognosis for women was influenced by a particularly high mortality rate among black women (48%); the mortality rate for white women was 32%, for black men 23% and for white men 21%. The mortality for black women was significantly greater than that of the other subgroups. Thus, findings in the MILIS population indicate that the prognosis after myocardial infarction is worse for women, particularly black women.\r"

High grade ventricular arrhythmias (couplets, salvos of premature ventricular complexes and R on T phenomenon) were observed in 33 patients (25%) and were related to lower rest and exercise ejection fraction, greater number of stenotic coronary arteries and higher prevalence of regional wall motion abnormalities at rest (all p less than or equal to 0.1). Among patients with subnormal rest ejection fraction, high grade arrhythmias occurred with greater prevalence in those with reversible left ventricular dysfunction (reduction in ejection fraction) during exercise compared with those with a normal ejection fraction response (59 versus 23%, p less than 0.05), a relation observed principally in patients with multivessel disease. These data indicate that in minimally symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease, arrhythmias are related to both extent of disease and severity of regional and global ventricular dysfunction and are most prevalent in patients with ventricular dysfunction and evidence of inducible ischemia, factors indicating poor long-term prognosis during medical therapy.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to prospectively determine the incidence of QRS alternans during various types of narrow QRS tachycardia and to clarify the determinants of QRS alternans. An electrophysiologic study was performed in 28 consecutive patients with a narrow QRS tachycardia. Persistent QRS alternans was observed in 6 (43%) of 14 patients during orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia, 5 (71%) of 7 patients during atrial tachycardia and 3 (43%) of 7 patients during atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia. Incremental atrial pacing during sinus rhythm resulted in QRS alternans in patients who had QRS alternans during tachycardia, unless the shortest pacing cycle length associated with 1:1 AV conduction exceeded the tachycardia cycle length. In patients without QRS alternans during narrow QRS tachycardia, incremental atrial pacing during sinus rhythm resulted in persistent QRS alternans in five patients in whom the shortest pacing cycle length associated with 1:1 AV conduction was 60 to 180 ms less than the tachycardia cycle length. In an additional 20 patients without a narrow QRS tachycardia, persistent QRS alternans was observed during incremental atrial pacing in 11 (55%) of the patients. In six of six patients who had QRS alternans during abrupt rapid atrial pacing, QRS alternans was not observed when the same pacing rates were achieved gradually. Among the patients with narrow QRS tachycardia, the mean tachycardia cycle length in those who had QRS alternans (mean +/- SD 288 +/- 44 ms) was significantly shorter than in those who did not (369 +/- 52 ms, p less than 0.001). The presence of QRS alternans was not related to the tachycardia mechanism, relative or functional refractory period of the His-Purkinje system (at a drive cycle length of 500 ms), age, presence of structural heart disease, direction of input into the AV node or concealed retrograde conduction in the His-Purkinje system. In conclusion, QRS alternans during narrow QRS tachycardias is a rate-related phenomenon that depends on an abrupt increase to a critical rate and is independent of the tachycardia mechanism.\r"

The presence or absence of the \"strain\" pattern of repolarization and QRS voltage was compared with echocardiographic and radionuclide cineangiographic findings in 95 adults with sever, pure, chronic aortic regurgitation and no evidence of coronary artery disease. In contrast to 54 patients with normal repolarization, 41 patients with an abnormal repolarization pattern had greater left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions (7.2 +/- 1.1 versus 6.6 +/- 0.8 cm, p less than 0.002 and 5.2 +/- 1.2 versus 4.4 +/- 0.7, p less than 0.001, respectively), greater left ventricular mass (431 +/- 138 versus 303 +/- 89 g, p less than 0.001), higher end-systolic stress (128 +/- 46 versus 95 +/- 27 dynes-cm2 X 10(3), p less than 0.001), lower fractional shortening (28 +/- 8 versus 34 +/- 5%, p less than 0.001) and lower exercise ejection fraction (39 +/- 11 versus 51 +/- 8%, p less than 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that left ventricular mass and end-systolic stress were independently related to the presence of repolarization abnormalities (p less than 0.005). Among the 73 asymptomatic patients, those with normal repolarization had significantly lower prevalences of fractional shortening less than 25% (1 of 45 versus 5 of 27, p less than 0.05), left ventricular systolic dimension greater than 5.5 cm (1 of 45 versus 8 of 27, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Insertion using the designated technique was successful in 45 (88%) of 51 patients with percutaneous insertion and 48 (96%) of 50 patients with surgical insertion (difference not statistically significant). The time from the beginning of the insertion procedure to the initiation of counterpulsation was 13 +/- 8 minutes for the percutaneous technique versus 31 +/- 16 minutes for the surgical technique (p less than 0.001). In the percutaneous group, 10 patients required Fogarty thrombectomy after balloon pump removal, and 1 patient developed severe leg ischemia requiring immediate termination of balloon pump support. In the surgical group, one patient developed leg ischemia requiring surgical intervention, three patients developed sepsis with bacteremia (including one patient who required vein patch repair of the femoral artery), one patient developed a wound infection requiring debridement and one patient had a cerebral embolus. Aortic dissection, aortoiliac perforation or amputation did not occur in either group. Major vascular complications occurred in 11 patients (22%) with percutaneous insertion versus 2 patients (4%) with surgical insertion (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that although the percutaneous technique for intraaortic balloon pump insertion is faster than the surgical technique and is technically easy, it is associated with a higher incidence of vascular complications.\r"

During counterpulsation, 45 patients developed limb ischemia that required premature balloon removal in 29 patients. The development of limb ischemia was significantly related to the presence of diabetes (risk ratio 2.0), peripheral vascular disease (risk ratio 1.9), female gender (risk ratio 1.8) and the presence of a postinsertion ankle-brachial pressure index less than 0.8 (risk ratio 7.9). There was no association between the development of limb ischemia and age, body surface area, balloon size (10.5F/12F) or adequacy of anticoagulation. Fifteen patients underwent vascular surgery for treatment of balloon-related limb ischemia, which was associated with one operative death. Nine patients had persistent limb ischemia (seven asymptomatic, two symptomatic) at the time of hospital discharge. Improvements in wire-guided balloon technology have increased the probability of successful balloon placement over that of surgical placement and have reduced the incidence of major aortic injury, but there is no evidence that these improvements have reduced the incidence of limb ischemia or its sequelae. This should be borne in mind before proceeding with balloon insertion in patients with one or more risk factors for developing limb ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Noninvasive assessment was undertaken before hospital discharge in 210 patients who had recovered from acute myocardial infarction. This comprised signal-averaged electrocardiography, Holter monitoring and radionuclide left ventriculography. An abnormal signal-averaged electrocardiogram was defined as the presence of a low voltage signal less than 20 microV in the terminal 40 ms of the filtered QRS complex or a long filtered QRS complex greater than 120 ms. During a follow-up period of 6 months to 2 years (median 14 months), 15 patients had arrhythmic events: eight died suddenly and seven presented with sustained, symptomatic ventricular tachycardia. Using univariate analysis, abnormalities in each of the three noninvasive tests were able to predict arrhythmic events. Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that each test was independently significant in predicting outcome, with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% being the most powerful variable (beta = 2.8, p less than 0.005). This process generated an algorithm that allowed assessment of combinations of variables: the finding of an abnormal signal-averaged electrocardiogram in the presence of an ejection fraction less than 40% identified patients with a 34% probability of arrhythmic events. By contrast, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction but a normal signal-averaged tracing, the risk of arrhythmic events was 4% (p less than 0.001). This combination of variables was associated with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 89%. Hence, using a combination of noninvasive tests after myocardial infarction, patients can be stratified according to risk of serious arrhythmic events.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the signal-averaged electrocardiogram in predicting the induction of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in high risk patients was assessed prospectively in 100 consecutive patients. Presenting diagnoses were syncope (38 patients), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (24 patients), sustained ventricular tachycardia (25 patients) and sudden cardiac arrest (13 patients). Using programmed ventricular stimulation, 71 patients (group I) did not have and 29 patients (group II) did have inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Using the signal-averaged electrocardiogram with filtering (6 dB/octave) at high pass corner frequencies of 67 and 100 Hz, the two groups were compared. The signal-averaged electrocardiogram was considered abnormal if all of the following criteria were satisfied: 1) the total filtered QRS complex duration was greater than 120 ms, 2) the duration of the terminal QRS complex of less than or equal to 20 microV was greater than or equal to 30 ms, and 3) at least one deflection (late potential) was present in this region. Differences between groups I and II in these three measures were highly significant (p less than or equal to 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of signal averaging for predicting the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia were 93 and 94%, respectively. Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified the signal-averaged electrocardiogram as the best predictor of induction of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, independent of left ventricular ejection fraction, presence of ventricular aneurysm, myocardial infarction and other clinical variables (chi-square = 93.2, p less than 0.0001). The signal-averaged electrocardiogram is a sensitive and specific test for the induction of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, having independent predictive value.\r"

In 18 patients additional morphologic information was obtained which contributed to alteration or refinement of surgical management. The adequacy of cardiac repair was assessed before closure of the chest in all patients. In six patients this information led to immediate reoperation and in four other patients to inotropic drug therapy. During congenital heart surgery, epicardial two-dimensional echocardiography may yield important information for surgical management. The technique is an essential adjunct when preoperative diagnostic studies are not conclusive or when the initial response to repair is unsatisfactory.\r"

Group II comprised 16 patients, 10 of whom had nonpulsatile pulmonary artery flow (5 with a right atrium to pulmonary artery Fontan procedure and 5 with a Glenn shunt). Six patients with pulsatile pulmonary artery flow had simultaneous Doppler and left atrial pressure measurements during cardiac catheterization. Group III comprised one patient with pulmonary vein obstruction, six with a large left to right shunt at ventricular level and two with pulmonary vascular disease. In Group I, biphasic forward pulmonary vein flow occurring during ventricular systole and diastole was observed in 26 subjects, 15 others had triphasic flow. In those with triphasic flow, the ventricular systolic component was divided into early and late. Reversed flow in the pulmonary veins during atrial systole was seen in 36 of the 41 subjects. The flow pattern in Group II was identical irrespective of the presence of pulsatile or nonpulsatile flow. The two periods of ventricular systolic flow occurred during the a to c and c to x descent, with the ventricular diastolic flow occurring during the y descent. Variations in waveform were mirrored in the left atrial pressure. Neither increased nor decreased pulmonary artery flow substantially altered the pattern. Pulmonary vein obstruction produced a distinctive pattern of high velocity turbulent flow. This technique demonstrates that extraparenchymal pulmonary vein flow is dependent on left atrial pressure events. It has major potential applications in patients who are prone to develop pulmonary vein obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "Obstruction to pulmonary venous return may be associated with a number of congenital cardiovascular abnormalities occurring both before and after surgery. Hemodynamic assessment by cardiac catheterization is often difficult. A noninvasive method for detection and quantitation of obstruction to systemic ventricular inflow would be clinically useful. Two-dimensionally directed pulsed and continuous wave Doppler echocardiography was performed before cardiac catheterization in 31 patients thought clinically to have possible obstruction to left ventricular inflow or pulmonary venous return. Primary diagnoses included transposition of the great arteries after the Mustard or Senning procedure in nine patients, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection in nine (in two after surgical repair), cor triatriatum in eight (in four after surgical repair), congenital mitral stenosis in four (in one after surgical repair) and mitral atresia in one. Severe obstruction was defined as a mean pressure gradient at catheterization of greater than or equal to 16 mm Hg at any level of the pulmonary venous return or of the systemic ventricular inflow. Severe obstruction was predicted if Doppler examination measured a flow velocity of greater than or equal to 2 m/s across any area of inflow obstruction. At catheterization, 12 patients (39%) had severe obstruction to left ventricular inflow or pulmonary venous return and all obstructions were correctly detected by Doppler echocardiography. The site of pulmonary venous obstruction was localized by two-dimensionally directed pulsed Doppler study. Patients with a lesser degree of obstruction had a lower Doppler velocity, but none had a maximal Doppler velocity of greater than or equal to 2 ms/s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This report describes an infant with congenital aortic stenosis who developed bacterial endocarditis after abdominal surgery and placement of indwelling central venous catheters for long-term parenteral nutrition. Bacterial endocarditis in this infant was complicated by the development of an aneurysm of the left sinus of Valsalva. Surgical intervention was necessary because of gradual expansion of the aneurysm with compression of the adjacent right pulmonary artery and descending aorta. Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography proved useful for the initial diagnosis and serial follow-up of this unusual disorder and for its successful surgical management.\r"

Prosthetic valve thrombosis recurred in seven (22%) of the successfully treated patients, four of whom were retreated with thrombolytic therapy. A favorable clinical outcome was observed in each. Fever and venipuncture bleeding were the most frequent side effects. Systemic embolization occurred in 4 (15%) of 26 patients with either aortic or mitral prosthetic valve thrombosis.

Nine patients (group I) received streptokinase within 1 hour of the onset of pain, and seven patients (group II) received it within 2 to 3 hours. All underwent multigated radionuclide ventriculography after streptokinase therapy and 1 week later. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the infarct artery was performed within 24 hours in all patients. An effort-limited treadmill stress test was performed before discharge. There was no mortality or serious complication. Mean peak total creatine kinase was 521 +/- 289 mU/ml in group I, and 1,614 +/- 709 mU/ml in group II (p less than 0.05). The mean initial left ventricular ejection fraction was 47 +/- 11% in group I and 37 +/- 10% in group II. After early angioplasty (within 24 hours) and at 1 week recovery, left ventricular ejection fraction increased to 53 +/- 9% in group I (p less than 0.05) and to 40 +/- 7% in group II (p = NS). Seven of the nine patients in group I had normal radionuclide ventriculograms at discharge compared with none of the seven patients in group II. Thrombolytic therapy administered less than 1 hour after the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction followed by angioplasty of the infarct artery results in preservation of left ventricular function, whereas therapy given after 2 hours has only a limited effect.\r"

Despite this unfavorable clinical course, nisoldipine caused some beneficial chronic (1 month) hemodynamic effects. It decreased systemic vascular resistance (from 1,781 +/- 229 to 1,306 +/- 345 dynes X s X cm-5, p less than 0.01), decreased mean arterial pressure (from 88 +/- 0 to 74 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and increased stroke volume index (from 27 +/- 6 to 33 +/- 9 ml/min per m2, p less than 0.02). Heart rate, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and stroke work index did not change. However, nisoldipine's chronic renal and neurohumoral effects were not as favorable. These were assessed during a 5 hour water load (15 ml/kg body weight of 5% dextrose in water) and compared with the effects of a water load before therapy. Nisoldipine did not change creatinine clearance or sodium excretion, but decreased water excretion (from 58 +/- 35 to 46 +/- 40% of water load in 5 hours). Over this 5 hour study, mean plasma vasopressin was also higher with nisoldipine (1.9 +/- 2.3 versus 2.7 +/- 3.2 pg/ml, p less than 0.05), but mean plasma aldosterone was lower (67 +/- 31 to 47 +/- 27 mg/dl, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The temporal stability of defibrillation energy requirements and the histopathologic effects of multiple defibrillating shocks were studied in 12 dogs chronically instrumented with an internal spring-patch lead system identical to that used in humans. Dogs were studied on days 1, 11, 18, 25 and 32. Data were analyzed by logistic regression and the energy required for 50% (E50) and 80% (E80) success was compared. On day 32 the dogs were killed and the heart was removed for gross and microscopic pathologic examination. There was a significant decrease in energy requirements from day 1 to day 11, as the E50 decreased from 6.9 +/- 4.5 to 4.9 +/- 2.5 J (p less than 0.02) and the E80 decreased from 8.5 +/- 5.2 to 6.1 +/- 3.4 J (p less than 0.02).

In all cases, both grossly and microscopically, there was no evidence of pathologic changes in the myocardium or coronary vessels. In all cases there was a fibrous plaque beneath the patch electrodes, at times containing an area of patchy hemorrhage; in a single specimen a mixed inflammatory infiltrate accompanied the hemorrhage.

This study investigates the incorporation and distribution of a partially purified form of hematoporphyrin derivative (Photofrin II) in normal and arteriosclerotic rabbit aortas. A thoracoabdominal exploration was performed in 15 rabbits. Group I comprised normal rabbits, Group II normal rabbits given 5 mg/kg Photofrin II 48 hours before surgery, Group III arteriosclerotic rabbits and Group IV arteriosclerotic rabbits given 5 mg/kg Photofrin II 48 hours before surgery. Multiple aortic biopsy specimens for frozen section were taken from all rabbits. In addition, open laser endarterectomy (with an argon ion laser) was performed on Group III and Group IV rabbits. Frozen sections were studied by digital video fluorescence microscopy to determine the distribution of Photofrin II within the layers of the aortic wall. The fluorescence of the intima of Group IV rabbits was found to be significantly greater than that of the intima, internal elastic lamina, media or adventitia of the other groups (p less than 0.01) and significantly greater than that of the internal elastic lamina, media or adventitia of Group IV rabbits (p less than 0.01). When open laser endarterectomy was performed, Group III rabbits required 103 +/- 14 J/cm2 and Group IV required 33 +/- 3 J/cm2 (p less than 0.01). It is concluded that porphyrins are selectively localized within the intima of arteriosclerotic arteries. This localization sensitizes atheromas to argon ion laser light and facilitates laser endarterectomy.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred nine dogs subjected to experienced experimental coronary occlusion were retrospectively examined in an attempt to identify factors influencing infarct size. A coronary artery was occluded by an embolus. The field of the occluded artery (zone at risk) was determined by subsequent autoradiography of 141-cerium-labeled microspheres that were injected into the left ventricle 2 minutes after embolization. Fifty-eight dogs were analyzed after 24 hours of embolization and 51 after 48 hours. Infarct size (assessed by tetrazolium staining) was directly proportional to the size of the zone at risk in both groups. The percent of the risk zone that developed infarction was independent of risk zone size in both the 24 and 48 hour groups. No differences were seen between male and female animals or between the dogs with left circumflex or left anterior descending artery occlusion. Infarct size was also independent of the heart rate-systolic pressure product at the time of coronary occlusion, and of the time of year. Eighty percent of the variability in the portion of the risk zone that infarcted in this population could be explained by the level of collateral flow in the risk zone 2 minutes after embolization. The linear regression between the percent of the risk zone that developed infarction and collateral flow was the same in slope and intercept between the 24 and 48 hour groups. The correlation between infarct size and collateral flow was slightly better when collateral flow was expressed as a percent of flow in the nonischemic zone than when it was expressed in absolute terms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess the safety, efficacy and mechanisms of successful balloon valvuloplasty, postmortem (n = 33) and intraoperative (n = 6) balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed in the hearts of 39 elderly patients with calcific aortic stenosis. The cause of aortic stenosis was degenerative nodular calcification in 28 cases, calcific bicuspid aortic stenosis in 8 cases and rheumatic heart disease in 3 cases. Balloon dilation was performed with 15 to 25 mm balloons in the postmortem specimens, and with 18 to 20 mm balloons in the operating room immediately before aortic valve replacement. After balloon dilation, valve orifice dimensions and leaflet mobility increased in all patients. The mechanisms of successful dilation included fracture of calcified nodules in 16 aortic valves, separation of fused commissures in 5 valves, both in 6 valves and grossly inapparent microfractures in 12 valves. Valve leaflet avulsion occurred in one heart after inflation with a clearly oversized balloon. Liberation of calcific debris, valve ring disruption or midleaflet tears did not occur in any heart. In conclusion, there are at least three mechanisms of successful aortic valvuloplasty, depending on the origin of valvular stenosis. Embolic phenomena and acute valvular regurgitation do not appear to be likely events associated with this procedure.\r"

  ".U": "87138869\r", 
  ".W": "Myocardial thallium-201 scintigraphy is being increasingly employed as a method for assessing the efficacy of coronary reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction. New thallium uptake after intracoronary tracer administration after successful recanalization indicates that nutrient blood flow has been successfully restored. One may also presume that some myocardial salvage occurred if thallium administered in this manner is transported intracellularly by myocytes with intact sarcolemmal membranes. However, if one injects thallium by way of the intracoronary route immediately after reperfusion, the initial uptake of thallium in reperfused myocardium may predominantly represent hyperemic flow and regional thallium counts measured may not be proportional to the mass of viable myocytes. When thallium is injected intravenously during the occlusion phase the degree of redistribution after thrombolysis is proportional to the degree of flow restoration and myocardial viability. When thallium is injected for the first time intravenously immediately after reperfusion, an overestimation of myocardial salvage may occur because of \"excess\" thallium uptake in the infarct zone consequent to significant hyperemia. Another approach to myocardial thallium scintigraphy in patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy is to administer two separate intravenous injections before and 24 hours or later after treatment. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the improvement in defect size on serial images predicts improvement in regional function and patency of the infarct-related vessel. Finally, patients with acute myocardial infarction who receive intravenous thrombolytic therapy are candidates for predischarge exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy for risk stratification and detection of residual ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the Ag 7 ELISA, all sera from groups with ABPA (21) and aspergilloma (15) had positive titers, and mean values for both these groups were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than control levels. By comparison, in the indirect ELISAs, most sera of patients with ABPA were positive; the sensitivity was 81% to 90%, and the specificity was 87%. Sera from other disease groups including sera from 13 patients with farmer's lung, 16 with tuberculosis, and 10 individuals with positive prick test to either A. fumigatus or Alternaria alternata were also tested by both types of assay. Up to five of these sera elicited significant positive results in the indirect ELISA, and although two sera were also positive in the Ag 7-specific ELISA, these latter titers were both below the range of values for the sera from patients with ABPA. With the use of an IgG calibration curve, the sensitivity of the assay was determined as within the range of 1 to 10 microgram of specific IgG antibody per milliliter. The Ag 7-specific ELISA is therefore a highly specific, sensitive assay for antibody detection in Aspergillus-related diseases.\r"

This was not confirmed by food challenges or by food allergy skin testing, although both patients had embarked on strict exclusion diets before the diagnosis of C1 esterase-inhibitor deficiency. Clinicians should be aware of the entity of late onset angioedema caused by C1 esterase deficiency mimicking food allergy and hence delaying the diagnosis of this potentially lethal condition.\r"

  ".W": "We developed an animal model of chronic allergic airway disease by repeatedly exposing nine sheep to tracheal instillation of ascaris antigen until stable increase in lung resistance at three times control in six reactive sheep (group C) was obtained. They were then compared to the three nonreactive sheep (group B) and a control group of eight sheep exposed to saline only (group A) in terms of pulmonary function tests and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analyses. Lung resistance was 1.5 +/- 0.3 cm H2O/L/sec in group A, 1.8 +/- 0.3 in group B, and 5.9 +/- 1.3 in group C. Trapping volume (functional residual capacity by plethysmography and by helium rebreathing technique) was 0 +/- 0.1 L in group A, 0.05 +/- 0.1 in group B, and 0.51 +/- 0.17 in group C. Upstream resistance at peak flow did not differ between any two groups, but upstream resistance near residual volume was 1.8 +/- 0.3 cm H2O/L/sec in A, 6.2 +/- 1.0 in B, and 28 +/- 6 in C.

Only three patients (11.1%) demonstrated a value of a provocative dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1 in the asthmatic range out of pollen season, but during pollen exposure, the number of positive responses significantly increased to 13 (48.1%). We observed differences regarding mean age, age of onset of symptoms, sex, and family history between patients with positive responses and patients who failed to react to inhalation challenge. It appears reasonable that an aspecific bronchial provocation test, performed during the pollen season, can detect with greater sensitivity patients with hay fever at risk of developing asthma in the future, and it also appears reasonable that these patients should be treated differently from subjects with \"pure\" allergic rhinitis. We expect the ongoing follow-up to clarify the prognostic value to be attributed to these findings.\r"

Patients with sarcoidosis demonstrated a significant increase in total BAL mast-basophiloid cells, 9.6 +/- 4.1 X 10(4), compared to total cells in normal individuals, 0.0, p = 0.03, whereas only patients with IPF had significant elevations in BAL histamine levels, 1315 +/- 737 pg/ml, versus levels in normal individuals, 161 +/- 54 pg/ml, p = 0.002. A good correlation existed between histamine levels on an aliquot of lysed BAL cells and BAL histamine levels, R = 0.655 and p = 0.02, but not with either the total number or percent mast-basophiloid cells in BAL assessed on Wright's stained cytocentrifuge preparations. Subjects with asthma had both normal numbers of BAL mast-basophiloid cells and histamine levels. These data suggest that BAL histamine levels are easily quantified, the reason(s) for elevations in BAL histamine levels in IPF need further investigation, BAL histamine levels in subjects with asthma are not elevated in those with mild and stable disease, and lumenal mast-basophiloid cells are one major source of BAL histamine.\r"

Serum was assayed preseasonally before starting IT and again in midseason at time of documented highest natural exposure. Antibodies were measured by ELISA, and immunogenic specificities of ryegrass extract were examined by Western immunoblots. Nine subjects receiving grass-pollen IT and nine control subjects had similar clinical and immunologic status before IT. RGGI-specific IgE antibodies (sIgE) did not change from pretreatment levels in actively treated subjects but increased in control subjects (p less than 0.002). RGGI sIgG increased approximately thirteen-fold with active IT versus threefold during natural seasonal exposure (p less than 0.0005). The IgG-blocking response to RGGI was restricted to IgG1 and IgG4. Ten nonatopic subjects had similar RGGI sIgG1 but lower or undetectable sIgE and sIgG4 than the 18 atopic study subjects. Active IT dramatically increased RGGI sIgG4 (p less than 0.001) and to a lesser extent RGGI sIgG1 (p less than 0.01). Immunoblots demonstrated eight IgE-binding ryegrass-polypeptide allergens, with RGGI ubiquitous, and 11 IgG-binding polypeptides, including all eight allergens. A negative correlation between seasonal rhinitis symptom-medication scores and RGGI sIgG1 levels was found (r = -0.62, p less than 0.01), but no other immunologic parameters assayed were related to clinical improvement. Although RGGI sIgG4 predominates in the blocking response and is a useful marker of effective IT, early beneficial biologic effects may involve IgG1 antibodies.\r"

The provocation concentration of histamine causing a 20% decrease in FEV1 (PC20) was measured before challenge and at approximately 3 hours and 24 hours on control and active-challenge days. Thirteen active challenges provoked eight definite late asthmatic responses (maximum fall in FEV1 greater than 15% at 3 to 11 hours). At 3 hours after the challenges that provoked late responses, there was a significant (p less than 0.02) decrease in PC20 that was more (p less than 0.03) than that observed for the five tests provoking early (late FEV1 fall 0% to 5%) or equivocal late (FEV1 fall 6% to 15%) responses. At 24 hours, PC20 remained decreased (p less than 0.05), although it was less so than at 3 hours (p less than 0.05) and not significantly when compared with challenge tests causing single early or equivocal late responses. The 3-hour decreases in PC20 were identified when FEV1 (five of seven observations) was greater than 90% of prechallenge values. For the nine independent tests, the 3-hour decreases in PC20 correlated (r = 0.72; p less than 0.05) with the magnitude of the late falls in FEV1, whereas this was not observed at 24 hours (r = 0.35; p, not significant).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Airway reactivity as assessed by the dose of methacholine aerosol culminating in apnea was determined after infusion of serum from allergic or nonallergic humans or with heated allergic serum.

Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was coupled to CNBr-activated cellulose disks to form a matrix predominantly substituted with isourea-linked N4-SMX determinants. After incubation of human sera with these disks or bovine serum albumin substituted disks as a control, the binding of IgE was assessed with 125I-labeled antihuman IgE. The binding ratios (counts per minute SMX disks per counts per minute bovine serum albumin disks) for sera from nonallergic donors and newborn infants averaged 1.11 (+/- 0.21 SD). Sera from 10 patients with histories of apparent immediate hypersensitivity reactions to SM were studied. Ratios greater than or equal to 2.1 (greater than 4 SD above control) were detected in 70% (seven of 10). Significant binding was detected in the sera of three of seven patients with other forms of SM allergy. Preincubation with SMX (80 mmol/L) inhibited binding 7% to 35% in eight of the 10 positive sera tested. Binding of one highly reactive serum was significantly inhibited by SMX, sulfamethizole, and sulfamerazine, but not sulfanilic acid or trimethoprim. The results of this study suggest that N4-SM is a major determinant recognized by IgE to SM and that an in vitro assay capable of detecting IgE to SM has been developed.\r"

Binding of specific IgE to the various Ags in the two extracts varied significantly both in frequency and in strength from patient to patient and within the same patient's serum. Sera from some patients demonstrated IgE binding predilection for specific DF body Ags, whereas other sera exhibited greater binding preference for DF feces Ags. Homologous, heterologous, and intermediate gel CIE and CRIE clearly demonstrated that DF bodies and DF feces share some common Ags or epitopes, but the two different extracts also were quantitatively different. Some Ags and allergens originate from mite body material and are not present in mite feces. These results indicate that only extracts containing high concentrations of both body and fecal allergens should be used in clinical testing and therapy.\r"

Immediate wheal-and-flare skin tests were positive with tobramycin and with penicilloylpoly-L-lysine. Desensitization with tobramycin in gradually increasing intravenous doses was accomplished during 8 hours. The procedure was complicated by a macular rash that remitted within minutes without therapy, but no symptoms or signs of an allergic reaction to tobramycin were detected during full dose therapy. Skin test responses to tobramycin became negative by the end of the desensitization procedure, whereas the responses to penicilloylpoly-L-lysine and histamine remained positive. A worsening course led to an unsuccessful attempt to desensitize the patient to beta-lactam determinants. Wheezing appeared during the administration of oral doses. This case demonstrates the feasibility of acute, antigen-specific desensitization of an aminoglycoside-allergic patient and the failure to achieve a second, simultaneous desensitization.

We report the outcome of seven drug-allergic patients with AIDS evaluated from 1982 to 85. Readministration of pentamidine was carried out without repeated reactions in three patients, and sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim were readministered after very cautious test dosing in two other patients. A generalized maculopapular rash developed after 10 days of sulfadiazine therapy for Toxoplasma chorioretinitis but has been managed with prednisone, 20 to 30 mg/day for 3 months, and sulfadiazine has been continued. The administration of prednisone, 100 to 200 mg daily for treatment of severe cutaneous vasculitis from azulfidine in another patient, did not result in suprainfection.

The purified GpI antigens were used to immunize individual groups of BALB/c mice. A total of 123 hybridoma-derived anti-GpI monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was produced. These mAbs were used to evaluate the antigenic relationship among the GpI antigens by means of two types of ELISA. The experiments revealed a high level of epitope diversity and demonstrated a wide range of antibody specificities. A cross-reactivity ELISA was used to identify and compare antigenic determinants on the GpI molecules, and it was possible to define mAbs with specificities unique for the immunizing allergen and other mAbs that cross-reacted with one or more other members of the test panel of allergens.

We have measured IgG and IgE antibodies to a purified rat urinary allergen in sera from 179 laboratory workers of whom 30 reported symptoms on exposure to rats. There was a very good correlation between IgE antibodies and positive skin tests. In addition, there was a close correlation between reported asthmatic reactions and serum IgE antibody to rat allergen: IgE ab was present in 12/18 of workers with asthmatic reactions but in only 2/135 of workers without symptoms (p less than 0.001). Serum IgG antibodies to rat allergen were present in all sera with IgE antibody but were also present in 30% of asymptomatic individuals. The incidence and quantity of IgG antibody correlated with the degree of exposure to animals (i.e., hours per day) but not with the length of exposure in years. Our results on rat allergy confirm that there is an increased incidence of asthma among individuals who were atopic as judged by positive skin tests to other allergens. However, this relationship did not apply to individuals with rhinitis alone, and excluding atopic individuals from employment would have been a very inefficient method of reducing asthma or rhinitis in this group. Our results confirm that IgE antibody responses to rat urinary allergen are an important cause of occupational disease. The results for IgG antibody suggest that their prevalence represents a marker for the degree of exposure to rat proteins.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that IgE-mediated release of histamine may be, in part, responsible for the abnormal inflammatory response observed in the hyperimmunoglobulin E (HIE) and recurrent infection syndrome, urine and plasma histamine levels were measured. Twenty-four-hour urinary histamine concentrations from 15 patients with HIE (23.7 +/- 6.9 micrograms/24 hr) were significantly elevated (p less than 0.001) compared to a large historical control population (10.5 +/- 0.7 micrograms/24 hr; n = 97). However, urinary histamine levels in HIE were much less abnormal (p less than 0.01) than in five patients with biopsy-proven systemic mastocytosis (159 +/- 62 micrograms/24 hr) and were not significantly elevated when levels were compared to 13 concurrently studied normal subjects (10.1 +/- 1.7 micrograms/24 hr) and nine patients with chronic granulomatous disease (8.1 +/- 1.2 micrograms/24 hr). Overall, there was no clear relationship between urine histamine values and the presence of infection as well as no significant correlation between urine histamine and total IgE or anti-Staphylococcus aureus IgE. However, urine histamine levels in a subgroup of six patients with HIE with chronic eczematoid dermatitis (42.4 +/- 12.5 micrograms/24 hr) were elevated compared with values from the historical control subjects (p less than 0.001), the concurrent control subjects (p less than 0.01), the patients with chronic granulomatous disease (p less than 0.01), and five patients with HIE who did not have skin manifestations (4.6 +/- 1.1 micrograms/24 hr; p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy, safety and mechanisms of penicillin desensitization were studied in 24 adults and two children with serious infections that required therapy with a beta-lactam drug. Indications for desensitization included debilitating as well as life-endangering infections. Increasing oral doses of phenoxymethyl penicillin were administered at 15-minute intervals to a cumulative dose of 1.3 million units. Parenteral therapy with the beta-lactam drug of choice was instituted at that point. Immunologic complications of desensitization or therapy, ranging from pruritus to serum sickness, occurred in 12 patients. The appearance of gradually worsening wheezing led to abandonment of the procedure in one subject with cystic fibrosis and severe pulmonary disease. The remaining 25 patients were successfully desensitized and received full-dose parenteral therapy. Chronic desensitization was maintained in seven individuals with twice daily oral penicillins for 3 weeks to more than 2 years. No allergic complications of chronic desensitization or recurrent full-dose parenteral therapy were detected. Skin test reactions to one or all penicillin determinants became negative in 11 of 15 patients retested after acute desensitization. Two desensitized patients became skin test negative, remained skin test negative after cessation of desensitization, and tolerated subsequent beta-lactam therapy without allergic reactions or resensitization. The results of this study provide new evidence that acute and chronic penicillin desensitization is useful and an acceptably safe approach and suggest that antigen-specific mast cell desensitization contributes to the protection against anaphylaxis.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effect on longevity of a diet that is concurrent with common dietary guidelines, a simple diet scoring system was developed and applied in a follow-up study of 2,820 middle-aged Dutch civil servants and their spouses. In the early 1950s those civil servants were seen for a health examination that included a dietary survey. Consumption frequency data of the quantitatively most important food items at that time were used for the diet scoring. Overall survival after 25 years was 46.8% among men and 68.6% among women. In men, a significant positive association between prudent diet score and 25-year, age-adjusted survival could be demonstrated. Of the 10 food items that constituted the diet score, a higher intake of brown bread, porridge and/or yogurt, vegetables, fish, and fruit was associated with a slightly better survival. In a separate analysis we had found a significant inverse relationship between coffee consumption and survival. A similar trend, which, however, was not significant, was observed for alcohol intake. In women, the results for the separate food items were inconsistent, and no effect of a prudent diet score on longevity was observed. The proposed diet scoring system provides a means for evaluating the effects of the individual's food choice behavior on subsequent health and longevity.\r"

  ".W": "Salt use in airline meal service was studied through observation of returned meal trays of 932 passengers. Observation and weighing of salt packets on returned trays revealed that 64% of passengers did not salt their airline dinner, while 6% used the entire salt packet, 0.92 gm NaCl (362 mg Na). Average discretionary salt use among the 234 passengers (25%) who added salt was 0.57 gm NaCl (232 mg Na). Estimates of total sodium in the four airline dinners averaged 2.0 gm NaCl (786 mg Na). Laboratory assays of menu items produced by the airline foodservice differed 3% to 19% from estimated values. Sodium content of the four airline dinner menus was similar and did not affect salt use. Discretionary salt use was related to the total amount of entree consumed but was not affected by the amount of salad consumed. It is postulated that salt use in the \"captive\" airline situation is predicated on consistent, habitual practices. Lowering sodium consumption in this setting may require alteration in both food preparation methods and quantity of salt presented in the packets.\r"

  ".W": "Food frequency information from 762 Utahns, aged 24 to 80 years, selected from the general population using a random digit dialing technique was studied to determine the characteristics of diets that provide 18 mg iron/2,000 kcal, the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) of iron and energy for women aged 23 to 50 years. The diets were divided into three categories according to iron per 1,000 kcal: category 1, 9.0 mg or more iron; category 2, 6.0 to 8.99 mg iron; and category 3, 5.99 mg or less iron. Twenty-seven percent of the women and 16% of the men reported consuming diets containing more than 9 mg iron/1,000 kcal. Six percent of the women consumed 18 mg iron daily. Total energy intake decreased dramatically as iron density increased, as did intake of protein, carbohydrate, and fat. However, the percentage of energy consumed as protein and carbohydrate increased in the high-iron density categories. Individuals in the high-iron density categories consumed greater proportions of their iron and energy from vegetable, fruit, and cereal products; those in the low-iron density category consumed more pastries, beverages, sweets, and added fats, i.e., high-calorie foods. When fortified breakfast cereals were removed from the diets, only 14% of the women and 6% of the men consumed diets that provided at least 9 mg iron per 1,000 kcal. Women can meet the RDA for iron from their diets if they consume the recommended amount of energy distributed across food groups as follows: cereals, 14% to 16%; vegetables, at least 11%; meat, fish, poultry, and eggs, 16% to 18%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A nutrition monitoring instrument was designed for managers at 14 meal sites to assess major components of the foodservice operation. A survey addressing participant perception of meal quality, meal acceptance, program administration and management, and foodservice personnel was designed and administered to 264 participants. The two surveys contained 17 identical or similar questions to determine any perceptual differences. The influence of social variables on participant response was examined. A significant positive correlation was found for age vs. food temperature, age vs. frequency of participation, and education level vs. evaluation of foodservice workers. Significant negative correlations were found for sex vs. special diets, sex vs. food aversion, education level vs. food temperature, and education level vs. evaluation of the nutrition education component. Manager vs. participant response significantly differed for food temperature, special diets, nutrition education, transportation, and accuracy of posted menus. Assessment of participant vs. manager perception of meal and service quality is recommended to management for more effective program planning, evaluation, and continuous quality assurance.\r"

Anthropometry is a standardized technique used to assess the response of muscle mass to nutrition therapy by quantifying the muscle and fat compartments. That technique does not accurately reflect actual limb composition, whereas computerized tomography does. Twenty lower extremities on randomly chosen men and women patients were evaluated by anthropometry and computerized tomography. Total area, muscle plus bone area, total volume, and muscle plus bone volume were correlated, using Heymsfield's equation and computerized tomography-generated areas. Anthropometrics overestimated total and muscle plus bone cross-sectional areas at almost every level. Anthropometry overestimated total area and total volume by 5% to 10% but overestimated muscle plus bone area and muscle plus bone volume by as much as 40%. Anthropometry, while easily performed and useful in large population groups for epidemiological studies, offers a poor assessment of lower extremity composition. On the other hand, computerized tomography is also easily performed and, while impractical for large population groups, does offer an accurate assessment of the lower extremity tissue compartments and is an instrument that might be used in research on lean muscle mass.\r"

This study examined prenatal nutrition services in terms of total costs, per client costs, per visit costs, and cost per successful outcome. Standard cost-accounting principles were used. Outcome measures, based on written quality assurance criteria, were audited using standard procedures. In the studied programs, nutrition services were delivered for a per client cost of $72 in a health department setting and $121 in a hospital-based prenatal care program. Further analysis illustrates that total and per client costs can be misleading and that costs related to successful outcomes are much higher. The three levels of cost analysis reported provide baseline data for quantifying the costs of providing prenatal nutrition services to healthy pregnant women. Cost information from these cost analysis procedures can be used to guide adjustments in service delivery to assure successful outcomes of nutrition care. Accurate cost and outcome data are necessary prerequisites to cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit studies.\r"
