Three groups received epidural doses of morphine 3 mg in 1 or 10 ml or meperidine 30 mg in 1 ml. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and central venous blood opioid concentrations were measured intermittently for 6 h after injection. Two groups received epidural doses of morphine 3 mg in 1 ml or meperidine 30 mg in 1 ml, and opioid CSF concentrations were determined over a 24-h period. Morphine appeared rapidly in plasma, and maximum plasma concentrations were usually detected 5 min after injection and averaged 33 ng.ml-1 in the 1-ml volume group and 40 ng.ml-1 in the 10-ml volume group. The terminal plasma half-life averaged 91 +/- 34 min and 87 +/- 27 min, respectively (mean +/- SEM). Maximal plasma concentrations of meperidine were usually detected 10 or 15 min post-injection and averaged 196 +/- 29 ng.ml-1. The terminal plasma half-life averaged 124 +/- 26 min. Morphine crossed the dura relatively slowly, and the absorption half-life across the dura averaged 22 min. Maximal CSF concentrations were usually seen 60-90 min post-injection. In contrast, meperidine crossed the dura quickly, with an absorption half-life averaging 7.6 +/- 2.0 min. Maximal CSF concentrations were seen 15 or 30 min post-injection. Morphine and meperidine concentrations remained several times higher in the CSF than in the plasma. The fraction of the opioid dose crossing the dura was calculated to be 3.6% for morphine and 3.7% for meperidine. There were no significant differences in the kinetics of morphine administered in 1 or in 10 ml when CSF was sampled close to the site of lumbar epidural injection. The CSF concentration-time curves of both drugs decreased biexponentially after the initial rise due to diffusion across the dura. The early half-life in CSF averaged 73.3 +/- 11.5 min for morphine and 71.3 +/- 3.1 min for meperidine, and the late half-life averaged 369 +/- 113 min for morphine and 982 +/- 449 min for meperidine. Dose-normalized morphine and meperidine CSF concentrations after epidural administration showed that meperidine concentrations were down to one-fourth the corresponding morphine concentrations from the 2nd to the 15th h after administration, which may partly explain the longer duration of analgesia from morphine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma were sampled frequently during a 6-h period and analyzed for morphine or meperidine. Maximum plasma morphine concentrations were found 5-10 min after injection, and averaged 4.5 +/- 1.1 ng.ml-1 (mean +/- SEM). Maximum CSF morphine concentrations were considerably higher than maximum plasma concentrations, 6410 +/- 1290 ng.ml-1. Maximum plasma concentrations of meperidine were also measured 5 or 10 min after injection and were low (36 +/- 9 ng.ml-1) compared with the maximum CSF concentrations (364 +/- 105 micrograms.ml-1). After a rapid initial decline for about 15 min after injection, the CSF concentrations decreased with a half-life of 89.8 +/- 16.1 min for morphine and 68.0 +/- 5.1 min for meperidine during the rest of the study period. The initial volume of distribution in CSF was similar for both drugs, or 22 +/- 8 ml for morphine and 18 +/- 5 ml for meperidine. After 6 h, 1.6 +/- 0.9% of the injected morphine dose and 0.41 +/- 0.09% of the meperidine dose remained in the initial volume of distribution. Large inter-individual differences in morphine and meperidine CSF kinetics existed, which may explain some of the reported individual differences in duration of effects. The disappearance of meperidine from CSF tended to be faster than that of morphine, which may be explained, in part, by the differences in lipid solubilities of the drugs.\r"

To study the profile of action, a segment of the aortic nerve of anesthetized rabbits was placed in a perfusion chamber and exposed to increasing concentrations of TEA-C12 and, for comparison, of procaine. Total nerve activity was recorded continuously and its change related to drug concentrations (concentration/effect curves). The half-lives of onset time after drug administration and recovery following drug-washout were also determined. To study the duration of conduction block induced by TEA-C12, the aortic nerve of anesthetized rabbits was exposed to a concentration slightly higher than the minimal blocking concentration for an average time of 130 min after complete conduction block occurred. Three to 40 days later, the nerves were examined both neurophysiologically and neuropathologically. TEA-C12 blocked nerve activity in a concentration-related manner, as did procaine; however, the onset time (t1/2) was much slower for TEA-C12 (9.2 min) than for procaine (2.2 min). Most importantly, TEA-C12 block could not be reversed within 9 h of drug-washout, whereas all the procaine-blocked nerves completely recovered (t1/2 = 3.0 min). Nerve activity was completely blocked by TEA-C12 and nerve block was accompanied by severe morphological damage with complete loss of myelinated nerve fibers and severe axonal edema of the remaining axons for about 4 weeks. Nerve function completely recovered, but with only partial morphological restoration between day 30 and 40 after the initial block.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Air was detected in the left atrium and/or aorta after pulmonary artery air injection of 0.04 ml/kg during 1% halothane anesthesia (n = 5). Addition of pentobarbital changed the threshold to 1.0 ml/kg. During pentobarbital anesthesia with and without halothane (n = 7), the thresholds were 1.1 and 1.2 ml/kg, respectively. The authors conclude that the threshold for transpulmonary passage of venous air is higher during anesthesia with pentobarbital with or without halothane than during anesthesia with halothane alone.\r"

Accordingly, the authors have answered this question in 12 consenting patients who required 1-LV to facilitate the performance of thoracic surgery, by comparing arterial oxygenation during a prolonged period of IH anesthesia with arterial oxygenation during a prolonged period of intravenous (IV) anesthesia during stable 1-LV conditions. The patients were equally divided into halothane and isoflurane groups. Each patient in each IH anesthetic group underwent the following experimental sequence: step 1, two-lung ventilation (2-LV), 1 MAC IH anesthesia; step 2, 1-LV, 1 MAC IH anesthesia; step 3, 1-LV, iv anesthesia; step 4, 2-LV, iv anesthesia. Stable 1-LV conditions were proven by serial arterial blood gas measurement. Conversion from 2-LV to 1-LV during IH anesthesia (step 1 to step 2) caused a very large and significant decrease in PaO2 (from 484 +/- 49 to 116 +/- 61, and from 442 +/- 58 to 232 +/- 97 mmHg in the halothane and isoflurane groups, respectively) and increase in shunt (from 14 +/- 4 to 44 +/- 9, and from 19 +/- 5 to 31 +/- 8% in the halothane and isoflurane groups, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the extent to which reduced pulmonary flow may affect non-ventilatory functions of the lung, pulmonary artery pressures were altered systematically in an in vitro perfused lung preparation. Metabolic integrity of the tissue was assessed at two levels: disposition of exogenous serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) was monitored as a specific indicator of endothelial cell metabolism; and whole-tissue rates of protein synthesis and levels of ATP were evaluated as indices of general metabolic activity and energy availability. Rat lungs were perfused with recirculating cell-free buffer (37 degrees C) for 1 or 3 h at high (36) or low (3 ml.min-1.g-1) pulmonary flow; initial rates of 5-HT metabolism were measured over a subsequent 2-min interval of single-pass perfusion. Metabolism of 5-HT was inhibited and protein synthesis decreased 35% at low pulmonary flow. These changes did not appear to result directly from hypoxia, nor from the associated fall in tissue ATP. The effects of low flow were not reversed at high PO2, nor was 5-HT metabolism inhibited by restricted oxygen availability at high flow rates. After as long as 3 h exposure to a combination of low flow, ventilation (V = 0), and temperature (27 degrees C) and to the volatile anesthetic, halothane, inhibitory effects on both amine and protein metabolism were rapidly reversible. Reductions in the rate of 5-HT metabolism at reduced flow involved a decrease in the maximal velocity (Vmax: 8.0 to 2.2 nmol.min-1.g-1), without change in the apparent Km (2.6-3.2 microM) of the pathway for amine metabolism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors compared the effects of nitrous oxide on segmental left ventricular (LV) function and the ST segment of the electrocardiogram with the effects of an equal concentration of nitrogen (crossover design) before the start of surgery in 18 patients who required coronary-artery bypass grafting. The patients studied did not have valvular or LV dysfunction. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with intravenous fentanyl. After endotracheal intubation and 20 min of ventilation with 100% oxygen, either 60% nitrous oxide or 60% nitrogen (randomly assigned) was added to the inspired gas mixture of each patient for 10 min. This was followed by 10 min of 100% oxygen, and then 10 min of 60% nitrous oxide or 60% nitrogen, whichever had not been administered previously. Patients were monitored for myocardial ischemia using a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram and trans-esophageal two-dimensional echocardiography. Surgery did not begin until the study was concluded. No patient experienced an ST segment change greater than 1 mm during the study, and none developed a new segmental wall motion abnormality during inhalation of either nitrous oxide or nitrogen. The authors conclude that nitrous oxide does not induce myocardial ischemia when used as an adjunct to fentanyl anesthesia in patients who have severe coronary-artery disease accompanied by well-preserved valvular and LV function.\r"

All children undergoing myringotomy received halothane N2O/O2 anesthesia administered via face mask. Information on complications and respiratory symptoms was obtained from the anesthesia and recovery room records, and by standardized questionnaire. There were no significant differences in perioperative complications between asymptomatic children (1.23%), symptomatic children fulfilling predetermined URI criteria (1.28%), and symptomatic children that did not fulfill the URI criteria (2.38%). In addition, the prevalence and duration of respiratory symptoms was significantly less in children having received anesthesia and surgery than in a matched group of non-anesthetized controls who did not have surgery. Results from this study suggest that there is no increased morbidity for children presenting at minor surgery with acute uncomplicated URIs and who did not require tracheal intubation. In addition, the administration of general anesthesia and surgery to this group of patients was followed by a decrease in both the appearance and duration of a number of respiratory symptoms.\r"

Animals in which either osmolality or oncotic pressure was decreased by plasma replacement with an appropriate solution were compared with a group of control animals in which both of these variables were maintained constant. Animals in which plasma osmolality was decreased by 13 +/- 6 mOsm/kg (from a baseline value of 295 +/- 5 mOsm/kg) showed evidence of a significant increase in cortical water content (approximately 0.5%), whereas a 65% reduction in oncotic pressure (from 20 +/- 2 mmHg to 7 +/- 1 mmHg) failed to produce any change. There were no significant differences in mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, regional cerebral blood flow, or the EEG between any of the groups. Although intracranial pressure increased in all groups, the largest increase (8.1 +/- 4.4 mmHg) occurred in those animals whose osmolality was reduced. The increase in intracranial pressure in animals rendered hypo-oncotic was no different from the \"control\" group (2.4 +/- 0.9 mmHg vs. 3.0 +/- 1.5 mmHg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The occurrence of fasciculations following administration of agents is a well-known pharmacologic phenomenon. Using the cat soleus nerve-muscle preparation, intravenous neostigmine doses between 20-200 micrograms/kg evoked fasciculations in a dose-related manner. The data demonstrate that the fasciculations were the result of the direct effect of neostigmine acting at the motor nerve endings. Vecuronium in a dose-related manner (3 and 5 micrograms/kg iv) suppressed this prejunctional activity of neostigmine. The prejunctional effect of vecuronium explains its effectiveness in preventing succinylcholine-induced fasciculations. In the presence of isoflurane (end-tidal concentration 0.20-0.25%), the suppressant effect of vecuronium on motor nerve endings was enhanced. The prejunctional action of isoflurane may be a major contribution to the additive effects of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants and potent inhalation agents.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary air embolism (CAE) can occur after heart surgery whenever air is present in the left heart or proximal aorta. When CAE occurs, its sequelae can range from electrocardiographic changes of ischemia to severe myocardial dysfunction and cardiac arrest. Since N2O has been shown to have detrimental effects in the presence of coronary obstructions, as well as the tendency to enlarge air emboli, the authors tested the hypotheses that N2O would enhance the deleterious effects of CAE, and that discontinuing N2O at the time of CAE would minimize those effects. The effects of ventilation with and without N2O on the cardiac insult due to left anterior descending CAE (0.02 ml.kg-1) were studied in 27 swine. Global cardiovascular changes that occurred after CAE included decreases in cardiac output, systemic arterial and coronary perfusion pressure, and LV dP/dt, as well as increases in LVEDP. These parameters returned towards baseline over time when N2O was discontinued at the time of CAE. Maintenance of N2O in the inspired gas after CAE occurred was uniformly fatal within 2-4 min in this model. Regional myocardial ischemia was significantly greater in animals receiving N2O, as documented by: 1) a greater incidence of elevations of epicardial ST-segments exceeding 3 mm from baseline in embolized and non-embolized coronary artery distributions, 2) a greater incidence of dysrhythmias (greater than 6 PVCs.min-1), 3) longer duration of depression of coronary blood flow, 4) longer duration of post-ischemic coronary hyperemia, and 5) larger decreases with less recovery over time of regional myocardial lactate extraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

On day 20 of pregnancy, cesarean sections were performed; a total of 1268 offspring were delivered and immediately examined for external abnormalities. They were subsequently examined microscopically either for visceral or skeletal abnormalities. N2O caused significantly higher incidences of early and late resorptions, and major visceral malformations. The addition of isoflurane to N2O prevented the majority of these adverse effects. These results cast doubt on the methionine synthase inhibition theory of N2O teratogenicity.\r"

Membrane preparations of lymphocytes were obtained from blood samples withdrawn from seven healthy young volunteers. Beta-receptor studies were performed using (-)125I iodocyanopindolol (125ICP) binding. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of (-)isoproterenol. Beta-receptor density (Bmax) and the dissociation constant (KD) for 125ICP were determined from saturation curves. Beta-receptor affinity for agonists evaluated by the IC50 (the concentration of isoproterenol required to inhibit 50% of specific 125ICP binding) and the dissociation constant (KL) for isoproterenol was established from competition curves. The effect of halothane 1%, in an air oxygen mixture (oxygen fraction: 0.3) administered by tonometry during ligand membrane incubation, on beta-adrenergic receptor, was compared to that of control experiments not exposed to halothane. Halothane produced a moderate but significant decrease of Bmax (-10%) and a significant increase in non-specific binding (+30%), while KD, IC50, and KL were unchanged. The authors conclude that halothane, in vitro, decreases beta-adrenergic receptor density. This effect could be mediated by an alteration of the receptor in the membrane due to action of halothane on the lipid phase of the membrane.\r"

All patients underwent cardiac catheterization. Nine patients had previously undergone coronary artery bypass surgery. Significant CAD (one or more lesions greater than or equal to 50%) was present in 33 patients. Atrial pacing produced ischemic ST segment depression (greater than or equal to 1 mm) in 18 (55%) patients with CAD, and angina in 20 patients (61%). As the number of vessels with CAD increased, there was no significant change in the sensitivities of pacing-induced angina or ST segment depression for detecting CAD. In the 3 patients without CAD, ST segment depression occurred in 1 patient and angina in none. Thallium 201 scintigraphy demonstrated perfusion defects in 27 (82%) patients with CAD, with fixed defects seen in 13 studies (39%) and reversible defects in 15 (45%). In the 3 patients without CAD, no perfusion defects were seen. The thallium 201 scan successfully predicted the presence of CAD in patients with single-vessel disease but usually underestimated the number of vessels involved in patients with multivessel disease. Combined sensitivity of pacing-induced ST segment depression and an abnormal thallium 201 scan finding for detecting CAD was 91%. The authors conclude that combined atrial pacing and thallium 201 scintigraphy is a useful test for detecting CAD in patients unable to perform an adequate exercise stress test.\r"

The drop in the level of ATP reserves that induces the poor deformability of the erythrocytes in atherosclerosis patients would appear to be caused by two consecutive shortages: first a shortage that seems to be related to a deficiency of erythrocyte adenosine as the ATP shortage disappears with dipyridamole treatment and then a shortage induced by the lack of erythrocyte glucose and suppressed by the addition of ticlopidine to the dipyridamole treatment.\r"

Eight patients survived various surgical procedures with 1 late death, 1 awaits operation, and 1 died in infancy. The authors' data show a significant potential for improvement in left ventricular function as shown by an increase in LV ejection fraction on medical therapy alone (5/6 patients), including all 4 with separate conus coronary arteries.

Patients less than forty years old and/or with small AVMs (less than 20 ml) had a statistically significantly higher risk of bleeding (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05 respectively). The risk of rebleeding remained unchanged in both small (less than 20 ml) and large (greater than or equal to 20 ml) AVMs once ICH had occurred. The average annual bleeding rate of a nonbleed AVM with seizure alone was 1.7%. Seizures with a partial component could be identified in less than half of the epileptic patients, and EEG abnormalities were found in 85.7% of 45 studied cases. The difference in mortality between medically and surgically treated patients was not of statistical significance. The numbers for both morbidity and good recovery were higher in the surgical group. The rationale for selection of surgical cases is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether patients develop true subsensitivity to antihistamines during chronic therapy, we studied 14 adult subjects who received chlorpheniramine for 3-day and 3-week trials of therapy. Titrated skin tests to histamine and compound 48/80, chlorpheniramine blood levels (by HPLC), compliance, and side effects were monitored and compared during the two courses of therapy and their respective 72-hour washout periods. We found a significant correlation between chlorpheniramine blood levels and skin test suppression during both the 3-day and 3-week therapies. The 3-day chlorpheniramine therapy was more clinically effective (measured by skin test suppression corrected for serum chlorpheniramine concentration) than the 3-week therapy (P less than .01). Chlorpheniramine serum half-lives and 2-hour chlorpheniramine blood levels were not significantly different after the 3-day and 3-week trials. Compliance was significantly worse (P less than .01) during 3-week therapy. Medication side effects (particularly drowsiness) were frequently reported during both courses of therapy. We conclude that subsensitivity to chlorpheniramine does develop in adult patients receiving 3 weeks of therapy. This subsensitivity is not explained by changes in drug metabolism. In addition to subsensitivity, poor compliance may contribute to sub-therapeutic results during chronic antihistamine therapy. Side effects from antihistamines may also require individualization of therapy for certain patients.\r"

They were then informed of their predicted normal peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and instructed in proper PEFR measurement. Each subject then estimated and measured PEFR under physician supervision and subsequently rated breathing, estimated and measured PEFR at home twice daily recording the observations. At the initial home observation, the correlation coefficient (r1) between estimated and measured PEFR was .98. After ten observations r1 was greater than or equal to .97 in all 18 subjects (group mean .99). The r1 remained unchanged in those subjects who completed 28 and 42 observations. The r1 was .98 when only the observations where measured PEFR was less than 20% predicted were considered, demonstrating the validity of the relationship during abnormal expiratory flow. Multiple regression analysis showed no significant trend in the difference between estimated and measured PEFR over time after the initial observation. Of 12 subjects, 4 were significant underestimators of PEFR and 3 were overestimators, but the magnitude of either tendency was relatively small. The correlation coefficient (r2) between a subjective verbal breathing score and measured PEFR ranged from -.23 to .92 on an individual basis over the three time periods, with statistically significant group mean values of .37, .39, and .45 at 10, 28, and 42 observations, respectively. The r2 for observations where measured PEFR was abnormal was only .14 and not significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At least one positive skin test reaction was seen in 66% of the youngest children, in 21% in the second group, and in 50% of the oldest children. At least 24 out of 37 skin test-positive cases in the youngest group had allergic symptoms after ingested foods. The corresponding number among 1 to 3-year-old children was seven out of nine skin test-positive cases, and 14 out of 21 cases in the last group. Hen egg was the most common food allergen in children under 1 year of age. After that age, apple, carrot, pea, and soybean elicited positive reactions as often as egg. Among skin test-negative children there were five cases reacting with abdominal and skin symptoms to milk and one child who had abdominal pain and diarrhea after cereals. In conclusion, skin tests are often of great value in the diagnosis of dermatologic food allergy. Allergen avoidance diets and peroral challenge tests are needed for judging the clinical relevance of the skin test result and also for detecting untoward reactions to foods caused by other mechanisms than IgE-mediated atopic allergy.\r"

Initially, control and study patients were at different institutions, but more recently a true double-blind random assignment to control or study group has been instituted. Nevertheless, all of the infants from these highly atopic families can be utilized to obtain the data reported; that is, the rate of change of IgE levels, the appearance of food sensitization (food-specific IgE), the signs and symptoms of atopic allergy diseases and the changes in cow's milk-specific IgG antibody during the first 2 years of life. Some aspects of the first three of these parameters have been presented in the eight references to this paper, but only preliminary data on the use of IgG anti-cow's milk antibody as a measure of compliance has been available. In this paper an analysis is presented of the various patterns of IgG antibody levels in the first 60 infants of the over 200 who have been studied to date. Both the age of onset and the subsequent changes in the foregoing immunologic measurements provide fundamental data with which to measure the success rate of any prophylactic or therapeutic regimen and may improve our capacity to predict the future course of infants and children with a strong familial tendency to allergy.\r"

This need raises a conflict between the need to document continued sensitivity and the effects of these repeated challenges not only on the natural history but also on the immediate induction of symptoms especially in the highly sensitive patient. Despite this difficulty, a number of investigators have provided data on a total of 177 infants and children who were subjected to repeated challenges. In only a few reports were these repeated challenges carried out in rigorous double-blind protocol. When the challenges were repeated, the results did not differ from the group as a whole. These studies agree that the prognosis in food allergy is excellent, with 60% to 73% of infants losing their food sensitivity in the first year and 26% to 53% of older children eventually remitting. The specific food causing symptoms (egg, milk, soy, etc) affected the prognosis but the intensity of IgE-mediated sensitization as indicated by skin testing or RAST did not. The data regarding the loss of immunologic tests as symptoms subsided differed from study to study. This may be due to the age at which patients were first studied varied widely or because the compliance with dietary restrictions in the various studies varied. Finally, a large majority of children developed respiratory symptoms to inhalant allergens at the same time their food-related symptoms disappeared.\r"

Sixteen children and four adults of which ten had atopic dermatitis (AD), six urticaria or/and angiooedema (two of which with oropharynx pruritus, oedema of the lips and anaphylactic shock), two asthma, and two gastrointestinal disorders. Food allergy was proved by clinical history, exclusion diet positive challenge test, skin prick tests (SPT) total IgE (PRIST) and specific IgE (RAST). Gastrointestinal permeability was measured in 5 out of 20 patients using mannitol and lactulose as probe molecules on three occasions: (1) by ingestion of the markers alone, (2) with concomitant ingestion of the offending food(s), and (3) with previous administration of ketotifen (2 mg) six hours before ingestion of markers and offending food. In all five individuals, food ingestion resulted in a significant rise of lactulose: mannitol urinary ratio and previous administration of ketotifen resulted in a normalization of the mannitol:lactulose urinary ratio. Patients with urticaria and/or angiooedema, gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and oropharynx pruritis with oedema of the lips were completely protected. In patients with AD, 70% were greatly improved or improved but 30% remained the same. It is our impression that ketotifen offers a new therapeutic dimension and therapy in FA.\r"

We found no differences in the IgE-related parameters such as levels of anti-apple IgE antibody in serum and secretions, mean size of apple skin prick test, and number of patients with a positive histamine release from peripheral basophils stimulated by apple. Similarly, we detected no statistically significant differences in serum and salivary total IgG and total anti-apple IgA antibody of the two groups. We could, however, observe a significantly higher anti-apple salivary IgA/anti-apple serum IgE and anti-apple salivary IgA/anti-apple serum IgA ratios and a significant correlation between the same parameters in tolerant patients when compared with the intolerants. These results seem to suggest that the presence of appropriate levels of secretory anti-apple IgA associated to anti-apple IgE might be one of the factors playing a key role in the prevention of clinical symptoms in atopic subjects.\r"

Furthermore, the reperfusion technique that optimizes coronary and cerebral blood flow after cardiac arrest may also be dependent on downtime. Peak blood lactate levels have been shown to be unchanged throughout resuscitation and predictive of downtime in dogs subjected to cardiopulmonary arrest and open cardiac massage. The purpose of this study was to determine the course of arterial lactate levels in dogs subjected to a fibrillatory cardiopulmonary arrest and conventional closed-chest CPR (CCPR). Fourteen dogs were subjected to five minutes of cardiopulmonary arrest and 30 minutes of CCPR. Resuscitation was performed according to a standardized protocol. Arterial lactic acid samples were collected at timed intervals throughout the experiment. Mean arterial lactic acid levels increased significantly with each sampling interval during 30 minutes of CCPR (overall P less than .05). In nine dogs successfully resuscitated, there were no significant differences in mean arterial lactic acid levels after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Open-chest resuscitation after five minutes of ventricular fibrillation in dogs results in peak lactic acid levels that do not change significantly once internal cardiac massage is initiated. In contrast, CCPR in similarly arrested dogs does not appear to provide adequate tissue oxygenation and/or perfusion to prevent continuous lactic acid accumulation.\r"

We studied the ability of the intraosseous route to accept a large volume of resuscitation fluid administered to hypovolemic rabbits. Hypotension induced by withdrawing one-third of the blood volume of rabbits was treated by infusion of saline, IV or intraosseously. A control group was bled, but received no saline. All three groups experienced a drop in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) to at least 50% of the prebleed baseline value. Also, all groups' heart rates dropped to between 90 and 95% of prebleed baseline values. A ten-minute infusion of a saline volume equal to three times the volume of blood removed reversed hypotension equally by the intraosseous and IV routes. After one-half of the fluid was administered, the MAP was 107 +/- 4% and 104 +/- 11% of baseline in the intraosseous and IV groups, respectively. In contrast, the control group had a MAP of 70 +/- 8% of baseline at the same time. At the end of the fluid bolus the intraosseous group had a MAP of 97 +/- 3% of baseline and the IV group a MAP of 99 +/- 8%. The control group continued to have a low MAP of 72 +/- 6% of baseline. Heart rates rose during fluid administration in both the intraosseous and IV groups, reaching 103 +/- 2% and 99 +/- 3%, respectively, at the end of fluid administration. The control group was 88 +/- 2% of baseline at the same time. The differences between the treatment groups and the control group were significant at the .05 level. The intraosseous route will allow sufficient flow of fluid to rapidly reverse hypotension secondary to hemorrhage in a small mammal (ie, the rabbit).\r"

  ".W": "Studies have attempted to define predictive indicators of diagnosis and/or prognosis for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the emergency department and to identify the need for hospital admission in patients with chest pain. Because prehospital predictors have not been defined, dispatchers, paramedics, and base station physicians continue to triage based on patient history. We reviewed 401 patients presenting in one year to an urban paramedic system with chest pain, normal vital signs, and stable rhythms to identify predictors of AMI and unstable angina. Thirty-one percent (123) had a diagnosis of AMI, 26% (105) unstable angina, and 43% (173) \"other\" diagnoses. Two-hundred seventy-eight patients required nitroglycerin administration, 182 required IV morphine, 14 developed arrhythmias requiring lidocaine, and two suffered cardiac arrest in the field. Nine other patients had a cardiac arrest after arrival in the ED. When comparing AMI and unstable angina patients to the \"others,\" 64% (132) versus 36% (74) had radiation of pain (P less than .003), 72% (95) versus 28% (37) had diaphoresis (P less than .0001). Neither difficulty breathing, nausea/vomiting, vital signs, initial rhythm, nor past history of myocardial infarction were helpful in discriminating AMI and unstable angina from others. Comparing AMI alone versus others, the presence of ST segment elevation on lead II was present in 15% (18) AMIs, 3% (3) unstable angina, and 8% (14) others (P = .005). Diaphoresis also was a predictor of diagnosis with 51% (63) of the AMIs and 25% (69) of others exhibiting this sign (P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using stepwise logistic regression, the three most significant signs associated with rupture were loss of aortic contour, tracheal deviation, and mediastinal-to-chest ratio. A formula calculating the probability of aortic rupture (P) using these three variables was derived. Using a low cutoff point, this equation would approach 100% sensitivity in detecting aortic rupture while reducing the number of negative aortographs. The reliability of this equation and the optimal cutoff point must be determined in a prospective study before being used to make clinical decisions.\r"

Animals were anesthetized, then given 50 mg/kg aminophylline IV over 20 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 1.75 mg/kg/hr. Hemodynamic parameters, including heart rate, cardiac output, systemic blood pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure, were measured every 30 minutes along with plasma catecholamines and theophylline levels. Marked tachycardia was seen in the intoxicated state, with heart rate rising from a baseline of 128.0 +/- 8.3 beats per minute (BPM) to 179.0 +/- 7.4 BPM (P = .012). This was associated with increases in catecholamines (baseline norepinephrine .04 +/- .04 ng/mL plasma rose to .42 +/- .21 ng/mL plasma after intoxication, P = .048). The average serum theophylline level during the experiment was 44.0 +/- 1.1 micrograms/mL serum. Esmolol then was given by IV infusion in these animals in doses of 25, 50, and 100 micrograms/kg/min. It returned the heart rate to the preintoxication baseline in a dose-related manner. Esmolol did not decrease cardiac output or lower blood pressure.\r"

Seven healthy adult human fasting volunteers participated. The study was double-blinded and subjects served as their own controls. Aspirin 2,592 mg was administered to each subject in the control phase to establish baseline aspirin absorption as measured by serial serum salicylate levels. During each of the five study phases 2,592 mg aspirin and a specific brand of activated charcoal were administered to the subjects and serial serum salicylate levels were drawn. Aspirin absorption was calculated using the trapezoidal rule for measuring the area under the concentration-time curve. Total aspirin absorption was reduced as follows: Super-Char, 57.76%; Actidose-Aqua, 50.42%; Insta-Char, 39.55%; Liqui-Char, 33.40%; and Acta-Char, 27.46%. Although there were large apparent differences in the adsorptive capacities of the products, the only statistically significant difference was between Super-Char and Acta-Char. The failure to show statistical differences in the face of large apparent differences may have been a reflection of type II beta error due to the small sample size. The most common factor responsible for the apparent differences in the adsorptive capacities of the products was most likely the surface area of the activated charcoals that were used. The higher surface area products, Super-Char (3,150 m2/g) and Actidose-Aqua (1,500 m2/g) prevented the absorption of aspirin more effectively than the other three products that had surface areas of 950 m2/g.\r"

A pretest, post-test, and eight-month follow-up evaluation design was used to assess the program's effects. Questionnaires were administered to randomly selected experimental and control groups of seventh grade students (n = 27). Repeated-measures analysis of variance detected a significant experimental/control condition x time crossover interaction effect for stated perception of riskiness, F (2, 31) = 3.20, P = .049. The data indicated that, over time, the experimental group perceived the riskiness of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol to be greater, while the control group perceived such behavior to be less risky.\r"

Evidence of fetal distress was not always apparent at the time of initial evaluation. In all cases, placental abruption was documented. The injury mechanism was generally impact with the steering wheel. At the time of the accident, none of the patients were using seat belts. These cases demonstrate that minor maternal trauma without apparent maternal distress may result in fetal demise. The data indicate the need for prolonged continuous fetal monitoring for all pregnant women involved in motor vehicle accidents.\r"

Age, sex, and duration of symptoms were unrelated to the incidence of self-medication. Self-medication was seen more frequently in patients presenting with upper respiratory infection symptoms (12%) when compared to other symptom complexes (P less than .002). This study suggests that self-medication with antibiotics can be an important problem in patients who present to emergency departments, as this practice could have an impact on clinical diagnosis and bacterial cultures.\r"

In investigating 2 outbreaks of blastomycosis that occurred in the summer of 1985 among persons engaged in activities along rivers in contiguous central Wisconsin counties, we isolated B. dermatitidis from soil at one of the riverbanks. Blastomycosis developed in 7 (58%) of 12 residents and guests who had gathered at a pheasant farm on the Tomorrow River in early May, and in 7 (88%) of 8 boys and 1 adult who had visited a site on the Crystal River in early June. Of the 14 patients, 13 (93%) were symptomatic. Two patients visiting the sites only once became ill 23 and 78 days after exposure, respectively. We traced one outbreak to fishing from the bank of the Tomorrow River, and the other to climbing into an underground timber fort along the Crystal River. A culture of soil and organic debris from the fishing site yielded B. dermatitidis. From these and other outbreaks, and studies of endemic disease, we conclude that riverbanks can be a natural habitat of B. dermatitidis, and that the environment around waterways represents the most important site yet identified for transmission of B. dermatitidis.\r"

The most pronounced effects were observed 3 h after Indo administration. Mean systemic arterial pressure (Psa) increased from 76 +/- 4 to 86 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), whereas mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) was unchanged. The cardiac index (CI) decreased from 3.1 +/- 0.2 to 2.8 +/- 0.2 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.02) because of the reduced heart rate, which decreased from 86 +/- 5 to 80 +/- 4 beats/min (p less than 0.05). Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance indexes increased, respectively, from 22 +/- 2 to 27.5 +/- 2 U/m2 (p less than 0.001) and from 11.9 +/- 2 to 13.4 +/- 2 U/m2 (p less than 0.05). We measured an increase in PaO2, from 49.5 +/- 4 to 57.5 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) simultaneously with a reduced venous admixture, from 39.5 +/- 4 to 30.5 +/- 3% (p less than 0.001). The calculated PO2 uptake was unchanged, but mixed venous O2 tension increased from 30.5 to 33.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Because Indo may interfere with the hypotensive effect of hydralazine and because hydralazine has been proposed in the treatment of patients with pulmonary hypertension, 7 of these patients also received 0.35 mg/kg hydralazine and Indo plus hydralazine (Indo + H) injected simultaneously.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fourteen college-age males completed six 1-h exposure protocols consisting of no drug, placebo, and indomethacin (Indocin SR 75 mg every 12 h for 5 days) pretreatments, with filtered air and O3 (0.35 ppm) exposures within each pretreatment. Pretreatments were delivered weekly in random order in a double-blind fashion. Ozone and filtered air exposures, separated by 72 h, were delivered in random order in a single-blind fashion. Exposures consisted of 1-h exercise on a bicycle ergometer with work loads set to elicit a mean minute ventilation of 60 L/min. Statistical analysis revealed significant (p less than 0.05) across pretreatment effects for FVC and FEV1, with no drug versus indomethacin and placebo versus indomethacin comparisons being significant. These findings suggest that cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid, which are sensitive to indomethacin inhibition, play a prominent role in the development of pulmonary function decrements consequent to acute O3 exposure.\r"

HFCWO at 5 Hz were applied by means of an inflatable vest. In order to avoid any discomfort, oscillations were applied only during the expiratory phase of the spontaneous breathing cycle. We compared gas exchange and pattern of breathing during control and HFCWO periods, each lasting 15 min. Minute ventilation did not change, but the pattern of breathing was markedly altered during HFCWO: breathing frequency decreased (p less than 0.001) from 18 +/- 6/min during control to 14 +/- 5/min, whereas tidal volume increased (p less than 0.01) from 600 +/- 200 ml during control to 860 +/- 400 ml. Secondary to this change in the pattern of breathing, arterial PO2 increased slightly (p less than 0.01) from 54 +/- 7 mm Hg during control to 57 +/- 8 mm Hg during HFCWO, and arterial PCO2 significantly (p less than 0.01) decreased from 46 +/- 6 mm Hg during control to 43 +/- 7 mm Hg during HFCWO. In addition, duty cycle (Ti/Ttot) decreased (p less than 0.001) from 0.37 +/- 0.03 s during control to 0.29 +/- 0.05 s during HFCWO. Such a decrease in duty cycle suggest that inspiratory muscle work was facilitated under HFCWO. In 8 patients, we obtained the tension-time index (TTdi), or the product of duty cycle and Pdi/Pdimax, and found that this index significantly decreased (p less than 0.05) from 0.06 +/- 0.03 during control to 0.04 +/- 0.02 during HFCWO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All measurements were made in a body plethysmograph. Polynesian boys had significantly larger VC, FVC, FRC, TLC, and expiratory reserve volume than did Polynesian girls. Polynesian and European children generally showed different slope and intercept relationships for the prediction of lung volume from height. Racial differences are not adequately explained by differences in body proportions or social factors including parental smoking.

Although the populations studied differed in age distribution and the frequency of both personal and maternal smoking, the assumptions of the AR1 model were met by both data sets, and the models developed fit both data sets well. Coefficients for personal smoking from the study-specific models were almost identical. An effect of maternal smoking on FEV1, which has been reported for the East Boston data, again was observed, but no such effect was observed for the Tucson data set. These findings suggest that the differences in reported results are not related simply to model specificity and that real differences in exposure or response to exposure may be occurring in different climatic situations. Such differences need to be taken into account in any assessment of indoor exposure to potentially noxious agents.\r"

A total of 747 (8.9%) performed an excessively variable FEV1 according to the American Thoracic Society criterion. After adjusting for smoking, age, and city of residence in 6 separate logistic regression models, the odds ratios for FEV1 failure among men were 2.32, 1.39, 1.40, 1.82, 2.61, 1.92 for moderate breathlessness, chronic cough, phlegm, wheeze, asthma, and recurrent chest illness, respectively. Among women, FEV1 failure was significantly associated with moderate breathlessness, chronic phlegm, wheeze, and asthma with odds ratios of 1.55, 1.45, 1.62, and 1.95, respectively. When all symptoms were evaluated simultaneously in a single logistic regression model, only breathlessness and asthma remained associated with FEV1 failure; odds ratio = 1.97 for asthma and 2.03 for breathlessness among men and 1.53 for both asthma and breathlessness among women. The 11-yr mortality experience of subjects with test failure, as defined by 2 different criteria, was compared to that of the quartile of the cohort with the highest cross-sectional test results. After adjusting for age, gender, and smoking, the relative risks of mortality were 1.62 and 1.98 for subjects with an FEV1 failure as defined by the ATS and 6-Cities criteria, respectively, and 1.99 and 1.90 for the groups with FVC failure as defined by the 2 criteria. Thus test failure is almost as strong a predictor of mortality as poor FEV1.\r"

Sixty-three of 69 patients (92%) had clinical conditions that could account for their decreased RV. Definite disease was considered to be present in the 39 patients with radiographically apparent parenchymal (n = 18) or chest wall (n = 21) abnormalities, whereas 24 others with clinical diagnoses such as congestive heart failure or toxic inhalation were considered to have probable disease. All patients who had a RV below 50% of predicted had either definite or probable disease. Follow-up testing of 19 patients 31 +/- 21 months after their initial reduction in RV was first documented indicated that the RV accurately reflected the patient's current clinical status in that it increased by 17 +/- 16% of predicted in those who were clinically improved and decreased by 27 +/- 7% in those who were clinically worse. In patients who were clinically stable, the isolated reduction in RV was a persistent finding. We conclude that an isolated reduction in RV is a clinically significant finding indicative of pulmonary or chest wall disease. Interval changes in RV reflect alterations in disease activity.\r"

In an attempt to confirm these findings, we measured DLCO using both single-breath (DLCOs) and rebreathing techniques (DLCOR) in healthy, nonsmoking volunteers over the course of a day and again at different times on different days. Serial testing over a day showed a consistent fall (0.39%/h for DLCOS and 0.56%/h for DLCOR) in DLCO that was explained by increasing carboxyhemoglobin levels (COHb) and decreasing hemoglobin concentrations (Hb). When subjects were tested at different times on different days and compared using a paired t test, there was no change in DLCO over the time of day using either technique. We conclude that there is no diurnal variation in DLCO when adjusted for changes in Hb and COHb. The measurement of COHb levels and Hb concentrations for adjustment of DLCO results is important for correct interpretation of both individual and group studies of DLCO and should be performed whenever possible.\r"

  ".W": "Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord was evaluated as a method of activating the inspiratory intercostal muscles. Studies were performed in anesthetized dogs after hyperventilation-induced apnea. A stainless steel electrode, rubberized along its entire length except for 2 to 3 mm at the distal tip, was introduced epidurally onto the dorsal surface of the thoracic spinal cord. Stimulating electrodes were also placed in each hemidiaphragm. Intercostal electromyograms, inspired volume, and thoracoabdominal movements were monitored. The inspiratory capacity was determined in each animal as the volume required to achieve an airway pressure of +25 cm H2O during passive lung inflation. Spinal cord stimulation at the T2-T3 spinal level resulted in maximal inspired volume generation and electrical activation of the parasternal, external, and internal intercostal muscles of the upper and midrib cage regions as determined by electromyograms. Intrathoracic pressure swings increased progressively with increasing stimulus amplitude and frequency until plateaus were reached at 6 mA and 40 Hz, respectively. Postphrenicotomy spinal cord stimulation resulted in expansion of the rib cage and reduction in circumference of the abdominal compartment. Inspired volumes during spinal cord stimulation were 537 +/- 49 ml (prephrenicotomy, prone), 347 +/- 19.6 ml (postphrenicotomy, prone), and 303 +/- 30.6 ml (postphrenicotomy, supine). Bilateral diaphragm activation alone resulted in inspired volumes of 404 +/- 39 ml. Combined diaphragm and postphrenicotomy spinal cord stimulation (supine) resulted in an inspired volume of 712 +/- 72 ml, which approximated the inspiratory capacity (803 +/- 35 ml). Our results suggest that spinal cord stimulation may be a useful physiologic and clinical tool to produce coordinated contraction of the inspiratory intercostal muscles.\r"

There were 9 subjects in each group. Statistically significant elevations (p less than 0.002) in NCA were detected in acute severe asthma when compared with each control group. Serial measurements of NCA were subsequently undertaken in 12 patients with acute asthma, at the time of admission to hospital, after 3 days of treatment, and on discharge after approximately 7 days. A highly significant (p less than 0.001) reduction in serum NCA activity on Day 7 compared with that on Day 0 was observed, and this correlated inversely with the improvement in lung function (PEFR). Gel filtration by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) using Superose 6 prep grade (6PG) indicated that NCA in acute severe asthma was heterogeneous and consisted of at least 4 peaks of activity associated with proteins with molecular weights of approximately 800, 600, 150, and less than 20 kD. The 800- and 150-kD peaks were also observed in control subjects, but to a lesser degree. The 600- and less than 20-kD activities were virtually confined to the patients with acute severe asthma.

AM were collected by bronchoalveolar lavage. The experiments were performed on unstimulated AM and on AM stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or zymosan. Our results indicated that, with or without triggering agent, the amount of O2 metabolites release was a linear function pattern with time. The accumulation of superoxide anion (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into the extracellular medium differed depending on the triggering agent used: with PMA, the amount of O2- released was threefold the amount of H2O2 detected in the medium, whereas with zymosan the O2- accumulation was tenfold higher than the amount of H2O2 measured. In patients with ILD, a significant increase in the amount of H2O2 release was observed for both unstimulated and stimulated AM (p less than 0.001). In this group, the measurement was repeated after a 2-month steroid treatment: prednisone had markedly improved the clinical, radiologic, and functional status of the patients, and this improvement was in good correlation with the decrease of O2 metabolite production. The amount of H2O2 release in each case was within the range of control values. Evaluation of O2 metabolite release by AM could be a useful parameter in the assessment of the activity of ILD.\r"

  ".W": "The pneumoconioses, interstitial lung disorders resulting from the inhalation of inorganic dusts, are associated with chronic inflammatory processes in the lower respiratory tract. To characterize these inflammatory processes in relation to the pathogenesis of these disorders, we studied 39 nonsmoking individuals with long-term occupational exposures to inorganic dust and functional evidence of interstitial disease (asbestosis, n = 18; coal workers' pneumoconiosis, n = 15; silicosis, n = 6). In all 3 disorders, the inflammation was dominated by alveolar macrophages. Because a common feature of these interstitial lung diseases is concurrent injury and fibrosis of alveolar walls, we assessed whether these alveolar macrophages were spontaneously releasing mediators capable of giving rise to these changes. Alveolar macrophages from the study population were spontaneously releasing increased amounts of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide (both p less than 0.01 compared to normals), oxidants capable of injuring lung parenchymal cells. The alveolar macrophages were also spontaneously releasing significantly increased amounts of fibronectin and alveolar macrophage-derived growth factor (both p less than 0.01 compared to normals), mediators that act synergistically to signal fibroblast replication. Taken together, these findings define a major role for the alveolar macrophage in mediating the alveolar wall injury and fibrosis that characterize the common pneumoconioses and suggest that the alveolar macrophage is an important \"target\" for developing strategies designed to prevent loss of lung function in these individuals.\r"

  ".W": "In cystic fibrosis (CF), the clinical effectiveness of aerosolized antibiotics is controversial. Previous investigators have not considered the type of nebulizer, droplet size, and dose to the lung in assessing the results of aerosol therapy. The present study tests the importance of these factors by standardizing an aerosol system for delivery of antibiotics and other agents to patients with CF. Particle size, distribution, and output from a commercially available nebulizer were measured. Thirteen patients with CF inhaled aerosol (MMAD = 1.1 micron) containing gentamicin (160 mg in nebulizer) and 99mTc-labeled human serum albumin. Patients' sputum and serum were analyzed for gentamicin levels by immunoenzymatic assay (Emit; Syva Corp., Palo Alto, CA). Using a gamma camera and suitable filters, central versus peripheral deposition (C/P ratio) and whole lung deposition were measured and related to sputum gentamicin levels. Gentamicin deposit averaged 12.3 mg +/- 5.9 (SD) or 7.69% of the original amount placed in the nebulizer. Peak sputum levels averaged 376.6 micrograms/ml +/- 275, whereas serum levels were undetectable in all patients. When peak sputum levels were normalized for the amount deposited, a close correlation with C/P ratio was obtained (r = 0.88, p less than 0.05). Furthermore, an inverse relationship was found between the C/P ratio and the %FEV1 (r = 0.76, p less than 0.05). Finally, a bell-shaped relationship between deposited dose and minute ventilation was seen in the patients (r = 0.88, p less than 0.05), i.e., an optimal minute ventilation was shown. These relationships may be important when designing future clinical studies.\r"

  ".W": "A model of increased microvascular permeability pulmonary edema was developed in chronically instrumented unanesthetized sheep using perilla ketone (PK). PK did not cause changes in pulmonary hemodynamics but did cause marked increases in the flow of protein-rich lung lymph. The changes in lung lymph flow were accompanied by radiographic evidence of both interstitial and alveolar pulmonary edema as well as hypoxemia. PK did not cause acute changes in lung mechanics. Dynamic compliance of the lungs and FRC decreased later, concomitant with the changes in lung lymph flow, radiographic evidence for pulmonary edema, and hypoxemia. Resistance to air flow across the lungs and specific conductance did not change significantly after PK infusion. The severity of the radiographic evidence for pulmonary edema observed after PK correlated with the severity of the concomitant hypoxemia and changes in dynamic compliance of the lungs. PK did not cause increases in the concentrations of cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid in lung lymph or plasma or changes in blood leukocyte counts. We conclude that PK causes increased lung microvascular permeability pulmonary edema without acute changes in pulmonary hemodynamics. This model permits study of the pathophysiologic aspects of increased lung microvascular permeability without the concomitant functional alterations that complicate most other experimental models of diffuse lung injury.\r"

After anesthetization, the dogs were intubated with endotracheal tubes and manually ventilated. Respiratory resistance (Rrs) was measured by the forced oscillation method at 3 Hz. Ascaris suum, diluted from 10(-5) to 10(-2) of the extract, was inhaled during tidal breathing for 5 min. One hour before antigen challenge, 10 dogs received 70 mg/kg of metyrapone (cortisol synthesis inhibitor), and 2 h after antigen challenge 35 mg/kg of metyrapone were injected intravenously. In another 10 dogs, metyrapone was not administered. After the maximal increase in Rrs had been assessed (immediate asthmatic response), Rrs increased again 4 to 6 h after antigen challenge in 8 of the 10 dogs treated with metyrapone (late asthmatic response, 443 +/- 282% mean +/- SD of initial Rrs), which was significantly higher than Rrs 6 h after antigen challenge (124 +/- 41%) in dogs without metyrapone (p less than 0.01). In another 5 dogs, ragweed challenge with metyrapone caused no change in Rrs. Bronchoalveolar lavage at the time of the late response revealed a significant correlation between late asthmatic response and neutrophil accumulation (p less than 0.01) in all dogs. We conclude that cortisol depletion augments the occurrence of the late response. The present dog model may be a useful tool for study of the late response in bronchial asthma.\r"

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from patients with ARDS, control patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD), congestive heart failure, or exposure to hyperoxia, and normal healthy subjects was studied to determine whether local alterations in procoagulant activity favor alveolar fibrin deposition in the lungs in ARDS. Procoagulant activity capable of shortening the recalcification time of plasma deficient in either factor VII or factor VIII was observed in unconcentrated BAL of all patients, but was significantly greater in BAL from patients with ARDS when compared with that of control subjects (p less than 0.001). Unconcentrated BAL from patients with ARDS shortened the recalcification time of plasma deficient in factor X, but no functional thrombin was detectable. BAL procoagulant from patients with ARDS was inhibited by concanavalin A, an inhibitor of tissue factor. The hydrolysis of purified human factor X by BAL from the ARDS and other patient groups was determined by measuring the amidolytic activity of generated factor Xa on its N-benzoyl-L-isoleucyl-L-glutamyl-glycyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide substrate. The procoagulant activity of BAL was associated with the development of amidolytic activity, indicating activation of factor X. BAL from patients with ARDS contained more factor X activating activity than did BAL from control groups (p less than 0.001). This activity was calcium dependent and was maximal at 1 mM ionized calcium. The BAL factor X activating activity was most active at neutral pH and was sedimented by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We describe an adult male with this syndrome who presented with ventilatory failure caused by severe respiratory muscle weakness and who demonstrated profound nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturation, particularly during rapid eye movement sleep. Treatment with negative pressure ventilation initially resulted in only modest improvements in symptoms, blood gas tensions, and nocturnal desaturation. The cause of this only partial improvement was upper airway obstruction provoked by the mode of ventilatory support used. After tracheostomy there was a dramatic and sustained improvement in symptoms and blood gas tensions and complete abolition of nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturation. This is the first report of an adult with the rigid spine syndrome presenting with ventilatory failure and cor pulmonale due to severe respiratory muscle weakness.\r"

From 1978 to 1985, total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation (TPA) were performed for secondary hyperparathyroidism in 23 patients who had had dialysis for a mean of 6.5 years preoperatively. Indications for surgery included hypercalcemia, bone pain and pathologic fractures, metastatic calcification, and pruritus. Four glands were found and removed in all patients; 100-150 mg of diced tissue were autotransplanted to one forearm. Two patients died of myocardial infarction in the first postoperative week. Bone pain, present in 19 of 23 patients, was relieved almost immediately postoperatively and relief was sustained to death (of unrelated causes) or most recent follow-up in 13 patients. All fractures healed. All patients had markedly elevated serum parathormone (PTH) preoperatively and 14 of 23 were hypercalcemic. The group mean values of serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and PTH all fell to and remained in a normal range by 1 year postoperatively in that subset of patients who did not suffer recurrence. Six patients were reoperated on after 12 to 37 months with partial graft excision for recurrent bone pain and hypercalcemia. Bone pain in two of these patients was due to aluminum-associated bone disease and the diagnosis of recurrent secondary hyperparathyroidism was erroneous. The actual recurrence rate was thus 19 per cent. Consistent technical success, with no late hypocalcemia, was achieved and most patients were restored to medical manageability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Inguinal herniorraphy was the most frequently performed elective procedure (33%), followed by colon resection (25%), and cholecystectomy (12%). Fifty-nine per cent (23 of 39) of complications associated with urgent operation and 39 per cent (16 of 41) following elective surgery involved the cardiorespiratory systems and were frequently related to underlying diseases.

Partial decompression of the anatomically obstructed bile duct was afforded by an anomalously high insertion of the accessory pancreatic duct and communication with the duodenum by way of the main pancreatic duct. All patients were managed by excision and retrocolic choledochojejunostomy. The efficacy of decompression correlated with the age of presentation and size of the cyst. These findings suggest agenesis-atresia of the distal common bile duct as one possible etiology of choledochal cysts and may explain the variable age at presentation.\r"

Design: Prospective, controlled study. Hand, wrist and foot roentgenograms obtained before, at the onset of, and during methotrexate treatment were scored for degree of joint-space narrowing and erosions by three rheumatologists using a standard method. Patients: Sequential sample of 24 patients with active definite or classical rheumatoid arthritis and previous unsuccessful treatment; of these, 3 were excluded due to drug ineffectiveness; 2, due to side effects; and 1, due to refusal to take methotrexate. Interventions: Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prednisone was continued. Methotrexate was given weekly to control clinical evidence of disease in patients. Measurements and Main Results: After having had an average of 30 months of therapy, the 18 patients who continued to receive methotrexate therapy showed significant (p less than 0.05) clinical improvement, as evidenced by their decreased joint counts and joint scores, duration of morning stiffness, pain scales, and sedimentation rates. Despite patients' prolonged clinical improvement, the mean rate of development of erosions and joint-space narrowing during methotrexate therapy was not significantly different from the rate of radiographic progression before methotrexate therapy (0.043 compared with 0.041; p greater than 0.05). Conclusions: Weekly pulse methotrexate is effective for the long-term management of clinical disease activity in patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis but may not be a disease-modifying agent by roentgenographic criteria.\r"

The four clinically defined phases of the program included patient orientation, evaluation, and selection (phase I); a new needle-wire guide-dilator transtracheal procedure and stent week (phase II); transtracheal oxygen delivery with an immature tract (phase III); and transtracheal oxygen delivery with a mature tract (phase IV). Sequelae and complications were minor, and patient acceptance was high. As compared with the nasal cannula, the transtracheal catheter was associated with a significant reduction in oxygen flow requirement during both rest and exercise. Adequate oxygenation was maintained over time, and erythrocythemia was alleviated with transtracheal delivery. We conclude that transtracheal oxygenation by this method has a low, acceptable morbidity; it is more efficient than nasal cannula delivery and may be more effective in some patients.\r"

Among women who were sexually active, the following multivariate adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were found; intercourse in the previous 48 hours, 58.1 (11.9 to 284.1); intercourse only in the previous 3 to 7 days, 9.1 (1.9 to 44.1); diaphragm use in the previous 48 hours, 8.4 (3.4 to 21.1); urination after intercourse, 0.5 (0.3 to 0.9); and past history of urinary tract infection, 2.7 (1.5 to 5.0). Several other factors previously postulated to be related to urinary tract infection were found not to be associated, including oral contraceptive use, tampon use, and direction of wiping after a bowel movement. When the women with symptomatic bacteriuria were compared to women with asymptomatic bacteriuria, the results were similar, except diaphragm use and urination after intercourse were no longer associated with urinary tract infection. When the women with asymptomatic bacteriuria were compared to women without symptoms and without bacteriuria, diaphragm use remained the only statistically significant risk factor. These findings should be taken into account in attempts to prevent urinary tract infection, as well as in subsequent studies of this disease.\r"

Neuropsychologic evaluations of 55 ambulatory homosexual men revealed abnormalities in 13 of 15 with AIDS, 7 of 13 [corrected] with AIDS-related complex, 7 of 16 [corrected] with HIV-seropositivity only, and 1 of 11 with HIV-seronegativity. Common neuropsychologic problems included impaired abstracting ability, learning difficulties, and slowed speed of information processing. Magnetic resonance imaging had abnormal findings in 9 of 13 patients with AIDS and 5 of 10 patients with AIDS-related complex who were available for scans. The commonest abnormalities were sulcal and ventricular enlargement and bilateral patchy areas of high signal intensity in the white matter. We postulate that central nervous system involvement by HIV may begin early in the course of AIDS and cause mild cognitive deficits in otherwise asymptomatic persons.\r"

Whereas only 15% to 20% of persons showed a significant (10 mm or more) reaction to tuberculin on admission, 2% to 3% of these developed tuberculosis. Persons having no reactions comprised two subsets: a small group who died at an increased rate and were probably anergic, and a larger group who survived as well as persons who had reactions. Minor increases in reaction size with repeated testing appeared to be due to immunologic recall. However, conversions of 12 mm or more from a documented negative result indicated spread of infection. When not treated preventively, 7.6% (women) to 12.7% (men) of definite converters developed tuberculosis. The increase in number of persons showing positive reactions after entry may have been due to rapid demise of the anergic subset, improvement in nutrition of survivors, or unsuspected spread of tuberculous infection.\r"

About 12 months of therapy was successfully completed in 1600 persons. Therapy could not be completed in 84 persons (4.4%) because of incipient hepatic toxicity and in 116 (6.0%) because of other types of drug intolerance. Although 135 persons (7.0%) died during the course of therapy, no evidence was found that isoniazid contributed to any death. The ratio of benefit (reduction of risk for tuberculosis) to risk (for nonfatal isoniazid-related hepatitis) was clearly favorable in persons who had definite conversions (1.6 for women, 3.4 for men) but less so for persons who had tuberculin reactions of unknown duration and for persons with minor increases in size of tuberculin reaction (less than 12 mm increase from an initially negative reaction).\r"

The results of toxin gene probing of the organism recovered from the patient differed significantly from those of other V. cholerae O1 isolates from the Gulf Coast and elsewhere in the world. A program of active surveillance identified no other cases of cholera in Miami. The source of the raw oysters eaten by the patient was traced to Louisiana.

This case illustrates two new clinical features: an acute, bilateral brachial neuritis, and a vesicular, pustular exanthematous and enanthematous rash. Studies of HIV-related serologic results show differential sensitivities for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, immunofluorescence, and viral antigen techniques in the acute phase of HIV infection.

Of the 1756 patients, 129 (7.3%) developed aminoglycoside-associated nephrotoxicity. The component costs of nephrotoxicity were calculated by hospital accounting methods; room and board costs were enumerated with per diem rates. The additional cost of hospital ancillary services per case of nephrotoxicity was $446 (p less than 0.001); the additional cost of hospital stay was $825 for additional routine days (2.74 days) (p less than 0.02) and $1152 for intensive care days (1.50 days) (p less than 0.01). Additional consultations were $78 per patient. Therefore, the mean total additional cost of aminoglycoside-associated nephrotoxicity was $2501.

We encourage the use of color film for specular microscopy to help detect and identify this pigment further.\r"

Secondary lung tumors were the most common, occurring in 23 patients (10.6%). Of the 218 patients with index primary laryngeal carcinoma, 113 were treated successfully and never developed a recurrence of the original tumor. Twenty-one second primary lung malignancies developed in this group of successfully treated laryngeal tumor patients. The occurrence of these pulmonary malignancies was distributed fairly evenly over time. Three patients developed second primary lung tumors more than 7 years after initial treatment. The appearance of a secondary malignancy in the lung had a devastating effect upon survival. None of our patients survived more than 2 years after detection of the lung lesion. The relatively high incidence and delayed onset of second primary lung tumors in this group call into question the concept of 5-year \"cures.\" Our challenge for the future should be the prevention and early detection of these second primary lung tumors.\r"

The use of this small caliber instrument has been investigated in 1) evaluation of endotracheal or tracheotomy tube position, thus decreasing the need for repeated chest radiographs to confirm location; 2) bedside evaluation of possible tracheal disease (eg, mucous plug, granuloma, tracheitis) in the intensive care unit patient to determine treatment plans and/or need for further rigid bronchoscopy, and 3) evaluation of airway dynamics in the awake patient. Our experience with the flexible fiberoptic minibronchoscope is reviewed, with a discussion of indications for its use, as well as possible limitations.

Several anatomic mechanisms of supraglottic collapse have been reported in the literature. The most common is a narrowing of the supraglottic airway with blockage of the glottic opening by the redundant tissue of the aryepiglottic folds. Although surgery rarely is indicated, severe airway obstruction, necessitating surgical intervention, can occur. Resection of supraglottic tissue should be performed only as an alternative to tracheotomy. Surgical procedures ranging from tracheotomy to epiglottidectomy have been advocated. Direct visualization of the obstructing tissue by nasopharyngoscopy allows the planning of an appropriate surgical procedure. In a patient with lateral supraglottic collapse, deep resection of the epiglottis would be expected to weaken the support of the aryepiglottic folds and aggravate the airway condition. Similarly, resection of tissue along the aryepiglottic folds will be useful only if preoperative evaluation demonstrates the obstruction to be at this location.\r"

Such a report may be an accurate reflection of the presence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or nonspecific pneumonitis, but may merely indicate that the true diagnosis has been missed. We retrospectively studied 38 patients with diffuse lung disease whose transbronchial lung biopsies yielded nonspecific abnormalities. Subsequently, these patients were subjected to open lung biopsies. Nineteen of the 38 patients (50%) had a specific diagnosis made by open lung biopsy. The diagnoses included bronchiolitis obliterans, alveolar proteinosis, metastatic carcinoma, lymphoma, tuberculosis, and bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma. Although transbronchial lung biopsy is useful in the diagnosis of many diffuse lung diseases, it is not a replacement for open lung biopsy. When nonspecific findings by transbronchial lung biopsy do not correlate with the clinical picture, open lung biopsy should be performed.\r"

Eight patients had both anterior and posterior costal cartilage grafts with stent insertion. One had a posterior costal cartilage graft only. Sixteen of the 20 children (80%) have been decannulated. Midtracheal or lower tracheal disease concomitant with laryngotracheal stenosis is an indication that endoscopic management of severe subglottic stenosis is likely to fail. Early laryngotracheal reconstruction is indicated for patients with a high likelihood of failure of endoscopic management and for those with severe cricoid cartilage deformities. Our results support the use of laryngotracheal reconstruction as an alternative to conservative (endoscopic) management of severe subglottic stenosis in carefully selected patients.\r"

In designing a device that would utilize this phenomenon, we theorized that stability, targeting, and mucosal contact could be maximized by an indwelling device that would conform precisely to the topography of the posterior larynx. In five dogs, molds of the hypopharynx and proximal esophagus were fashioned in vivo by injection of an alginate compound. From each mold was constructed a vinyl platform blanketed with electrodes. Each platform fit snugly in place, and could activate the nerve consistently in any of the dogs. With as little as 3 mA pulsatile current, use of specific electrodes enabled bilateral abduction, more than doubling the resting glottic aperture. Bilateral adduction was sometimes attainable. Such a platform may have use in visualizing subglottic lesions, diagnosing laryngeal movement disorders, and facilitating intubation and extubation.\r"

Factors that may exacerbate this injury include intubation technique, duration of intubation, tube geometry and constitution, frequency of reintubation, and patient-related factors such as concomitant medical diseases. The contribution of underlying medical disease to laryngeal intubation injury was studied prospectively by sequential endoscopy from the time of tracheotomy. Diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and a history of stroke or tuberculosis increased the likelihood of severe laryngeal injury. The association of these disorders with severe laryngeal injury should lead to consideration of earlier tracheotomy in such patients.\r"

Nineteen patients were intubated nasotracheally, and five were intubated orally. Sinus air fluid levels, indicative of bleeding into the sinus, were seen on 17 initial computed tomographic scans. Maxillary sinus suppuration occurred in 23 patients; in 20 it was the initial sinus involved. Twenty-one patients developed polymicrobial sinusitis. Coexisting infections were common. In 15 patients with concurrent tracheobronchitis or pneumonia, organisms identical to those in sinus aspirations were recovered from the sputum. Seven patients had associated bacteremia. Meningitis in six patients shared a common pathogen with their sinusitis. Nonoperative management successfully resolved sinus infection in 19 cases. Five patients required open sinusotomy.\r"

  ".W": "Laryngoscopy and panendoscopy can cause airway complications. To determine the risk to the airway from reintubation following general anesthesia in otolaryngology patients, we examined recovery room and anesthesia records at the Albany Veterans Administration Medical Center covering a 10-year period. From this information we determined the incidence of recovery room reintubation and studied airway risk factors associated with otolaryngologic endoscopy. From 1975 to 1984, 10,060 surgical patients were intubated at the Albany VA Medical Center. Only 17 patients (0.17%) required reintubation. Of 1,365 otolaryngology patients intubated during the same period, 324 had laryngoscopy and 302 had panendoscopy. Significantly, four laryngoscopy patients (1.2%) and nine panendoscopy patients (3%) required recovery room intubation. Nine endoscopy patients needed reintubation within 1 hour of extubation. We conclude that the risk of postoperative airway compromise is significantly greater among patients who underwent diagnostic laryngoscopy and panendoscopy than among patients who had general anesthesia for other reasons.\r"

We have followed the course of psoriasis in 13 patients over 2 1/2 years in a population of more than 1000 HIV-positive individuals. Four patients had a history of mild psoriasis that became severe and uncontrollable as symptoms of immunodeficiency developed. Psoriasis and HIV positivity, AIDS-related complex, or AIDS simultaneously developed in nine patients. In addition to psoriasis, Reiter's syndrome (arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis) developed in one patient in the first group and three patients in the second group. Opportunistic infections, especially candidiasis and Staphylococcus, drugs, and an altered immune system may contribute to the development or flare of psoriasis in these patients. The appearance of severe psoriasis (especially in a patient with other risk factors for HIV) should prompt evaluation for HIV, and may be a poor prognostic indicator in HIV-positive patients, since nine of our 13 patients have died. Immunosuppressive therapy with methotrexate is contraindicated in this group of patients. Newer forms of drug therapy including etretinate show promising results for the management of AIDS-associated psoriasis.\r"

Two thirds of the entire group and 83% of the 23 octogenarians reported medical concerns regarding their skin, with pruritus as the most frequent complaint. On examination, all subjects had at least one cutaneous abnormality, and symptomatic and/or medically significant disorders were present in 64.7%. In decreasing order of prevalence, disorders for which dermatologic therapy was judged desirable included actinic keratoses, tinea pedis, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, stasis dermatitis, and skin cancer. Overall, there was rather poor correlation between the subjects' complaints and perceptions and objective physical findings. Further, despite a high prevalence and long average duration of dermatologic concerns, very few subjects had consulted a physician for these problems, and no complaints other than \"rashes\" and pruritus had ever been discussed with any health care professional. Review of skin care regimens revealed substantial limitations with regard to bathing, shampooing, and nail care, particularly for subjects aged 80 years or older. Despite a small sample size and possibility of selection bias among the subjects, these data strongly suggest that skin problems are common among the elderly and that at present their dermatologic needs are largely unmet.\r"

Electron microscopic evaluation revealed vacuolization changes of fat cells with detachment of their cell membrane from the basal lamina that permitted lymphocytes and macrophages to enter into this developed space. We believe that the detachment of fat cells from the basal lamina precedes invasion by lymphocytes which, in turn, attracts macrophages into the space. This eventually leads to fat-cell lysis accompanied by activation of macrophages, which causes further inflammation, completing the picture of panniculitis in the erythema nodosum-like lesions in Behcet's syndrome.\r"

The refeeding of safflower oil containing linoleic acid or primrose oil (containing linoleic acid [18:2n-6] and gamma-linolenic acid [18:3n-6]) acids to EFA-deficient guinea pigs reverses the EFA-deficiency symptoms.

These results indicate: (1) that an understanding of the roles of vegetable or fish oil in skin must evolve from an understanding of the roles of each constituent n-6 or n-3 fatty acid, and (2) that the n-3 fatty acids may function to modulate the metabolism and function of the n-6 fatty acids in vivo.\r"

Two of these proteins bind all-trans-retinol and are found within cells important in vitamin A metabolism or function. These two proteins have considerable sequence homology and have been named cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP) and cellular retinol-binding protein, type II (CRBP [II]). A third intracellular protein, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP) also is structurally similar but binds only retinoic acid. Although retinol appears to be bound quite similarly by the two retinol-binding proteins, subtle differences are apparent that appear to be related to the different functions of the two proteins. That, coupled with the specific cellular locations of the two proteins, suggests their roles. Cellular retinol-binding protein appears to have several roles, including (1) delivering retinol to specific binding sites within the nucleus and (2) participating in the transepithelial movement of retinol across certain blood-organ barriers. In contrast, CRBP (II) appears to be involved in the intestinal absorption of vitamin A and, in particular, may direct retinol to a specific esterifying enzyme, resulting in the production of fatty acyl esters of retinol that are incorporated into chylomicrons for release to the lymph. Like CRBP, CRABP can deliver its ligand retinoic acid to specific binding sites within the nucleus, sites different from those for retinol. The nuclear binding of retinol and retinoic acid may be part of the mechanism by which vitamin A directs the state of differentiation of epithelial tissue.\r"

In addition, a third drank alcohol at least once a week, a third felt depressed at least once a week, and a third had had time off school for illness in the previous four weeks. There were strong associations between smoking tobacco and other forms of drug abuse. On the positive side, most children felt responsible for their own health with three quarters agreeing that good health is mainly due to sensible living.

During the night blood pressure and heart rate fell by 10% and 14% of the daytime values, respectively. Mean (SD) blood pressure was significantly higher in boys than in girls (126/72 (17/8) v 109/64 (9/5) mm Hg) and measurements correlated positively with age, body weight, and height of the subjects. Heart rate was not significantly influenced by gender or age. A positive correlation between heart rate and blood pressure was found when expressed as standard normal deviations or hourly variations.

The incidence of hyperkalemia in the cohort of 200 infants weighing less than 1500 g at birth was 3.5%. Hyperkalaemia was associated with a high incidence of cardiac arrhythmia (60%), impaired renal function (50%), and changes on cerebral ultrasonography (88%). Hyperkalaemia responds slowly to conventional treatment with dextrose, insulin, and exchange resins. There is a close temporal relation in some infants between hyperkalaemia and cardiac arrhythmias and periventricular leukomalacia, suggesting a causal association.\r"

Young age at presentation, low score on the Glasgow coma scale, disruption of oculocephalic responses, and laboratory evidence of virus infection within the central nervous system were significantly associated with poor outcome.

There was a significant improved response rate for I.A. (62%) compared with I.V. (17%) treatment (p less than 0.003). However, the improved response rate for patients in whom I.A. therapy was used did not translate to a significantly improved survival rate. The 2-year actuarial survival rates for the groups for which I.A. and I.V. therapy was used were 22% and 15% respectively, with the survival curves not differing significantly (p = 0.27). These results may have been due to the inclusion of patients with tumor in draining hepatic lymph nodes. The presence of tumor in hepatic lymph nodes was associated with a poorer prognosis. Analysis of a subgroup of patients with negative hepatic lymph nodes suggested an improved actuarial survival rate in patients for whom I.A. versus I.V. therapy was used (p less than 0.03). The toxicity of I.A. FUDR was considerable, and side effects included chemical hepatitis (79%), biliary sclerosis (21%), peptic ulcers (17%), and gastritis/duodenitis (21%). The only major effect of toxicity of I.V. FUDR was severe diarrhea (59%). Regional I.A. FUDR allowed more drug delivery to liver tumors, which resulted in increased tumor responses when compared with use of systemic therapy. However, the small gain in survival seen in a select subgroup of patients with negative hepatic nodes appeared to be offset by the toxicity of I.A. FUDR.\r"

Stage for stage, the development of local regional failure was reduced for patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy compared with a historic control series. Local recurrence occurred in 8%, 21%, and 31% of patients with Stage B3, C2, and C3 tumors who had radiation therapy, respectively, whereas the local failure rates were 31%, 36%, and 53% in patients treated with surgery alone. There was a 13% and 12% improvement in the 5-year disease-free survival rate in the patients with Stage B3 and C3 lesions who had radiotherapy compared with the historic controls. For patients with Stage C disease, local control and disease-free survival rates decreased progressively with increasing nodal involvement; however, local control and disease-free survival rates were higher in the patients who had radiotherapy than in those who had surgery alone. Failure patterns in the patients who had radiotherapy did not show any notable changes compared with those for patients who had surgery alone. Postoperative radiation therapy for Stage B3, C2, and C3 colonic carcinoma is a promising treatment approach that deserves further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and pathologic data from 51 patients with primary sarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract treated from 1951 through 1984 were reviewed to determine clinical presentation, histologic features, treatment, and prognostic factors. The most common signs and symptoms were abdominal pain (62%), gastrointestinal bleeding (40%), and/or abdominal mass (38%). The primary site was stomach in 50%, small bowel in 30%, colorectum in 15%, and esophagus in 5%. Virtually all the sarcomas were leiomyosarcomas. Distribution was uniform among the three histologic grades; although 88% of Grade 1 tumors could be completely excised, only 35% of Grade 3 tumors could be completely resected. The 5-year survival rate was 75% for Grade 1 tumors, 16% for Grade 2 tumors, and 28% for Grade 3 tumors (p = 0.0013, Grade 1 vs. 2 and 3). Thirty of the 51 patients (59%) had curative resection with an operative morbidity rate of 24% and an operative mortality rate of 12%; at 5 years the disease-free survival rate was 58% and the overall survival rate was 63% (48% at 10 years). Eleven patients (42%) had recurrent disease develop at a median interval of 2 years after complete tumor excision. Twenty-one patients (41%) had partial excision or biopsy only of their tumors with an operative morbidity rate of 28%, operative mortality rate of 8%, and median survival of only 9 months. Overall, patients whose tumors were confined to the site of origin had a 58% 5-year survival rate compared with 20% for those whose tumors had invaded adjacent organs (p less than 0.05). If the tumor was less than 10 cm in size, the 5-year survival rate was 78%, significantly better than the 38% for tumors greater than 10 cm (p = 0.03). These data suggest that histologic grade, local invasiveness, size, and extent of resection are the most important prognostic factors for patients with primary gastrointestinal sarcomas. Patients who have resection of all gross tumor, especially if it is well differentiated and localized, have a good prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "Exocrine and endocrine stomach was studied serially in 13 patients who had gastrobulbar preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (GPPD). In most of them, acid output temporarily increased just after operation but recovered. Gastrin response level decreased transiently but returned to the preoperative level. A negative correlation was observed between the acid and gastrin levels, which suggests that the negative feedback mechanism between parietal cells and G cells was maintained. Acid and gastrin levels in GPPD were higher than those in conventional pancreatoduodenectomy (cPD) but not remarkably different from those of the controls. No peptic ulcer was detected after the operation. These findings indicated that GPPD poses little problem concerning offensive factors. Postoperative ulcer formation is considered to be prevented by the authors' procedure, which is devised to best preserve defensive mechanisms so that duodenectomy is minimized and the gastrointestinal continuity is reconstructed physiologically from mouth to anus by end-to-end duodenoduodenestomy, end-to-side pancreatojejunostomy, and end-to-side choledochojejunostomy.\r"

  ".U": "88076167\r", 
  ".W": "In contrast to other studies, a recent report from the authors' institution has shown a good prognosis for functional recovery in geriatric patients that survive trauma. Because most survivors regained their pre-injury function, the authors examined factors related to nonsurvival in this population of 82 consecutive blunt trauma victims older than the age of 65. Seventeen patients died (21%). Compared with survivors, nonsurvivors were older, had more severe overall injury, and had more severe head and neck trauma but did not differ in severity of trauma that did not involve the head and neck, number of body regions injured, mechanism of injury, or incidence of surgery after injury. Nonsurvivors experienced more frequent complications (82% vs. 33%, p less than 0.05), including a higher incidence of cardiac complications (53% vs. 15%, p less than 0.05) and ventilator dependence for 5 or more days (41% vs. 14%, p less than 0.05). Mortality rates were increased in patients who were 80 years of age or older compared with those ages 65-79 (46% vs. 10%, p less than 0.01), despite injury of similar severity. More frequent complications may contribute to an increased mortality rate in the older group, including an increased incidence of prolonged mechanical ventilation (36% vs. 12%, p less than 0.025), cardiac complications (54% vs. 10%, p less than 0.01), and pneumonia (36% vs. 16%, p less than 0.06). Severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score [ISS] greater than or equal to 25) older than 80 years old had a mortality rate of 80%, and the survivors required permanent nursing home care. Discriminant analysis yielded a reliable method of differentiating survivors from nonsurvivors based on age, ISS, and the presence of cardiac and septic complications. To assess the accuracy of the discriminant function, 61 consecutive patients admitted during 1985 were reviewed prospectively. Discriminant scoring predicted outcome correctly in 92% of these patients. A Geriatric Trauma Survival Score (GTSS) based on the discriminant function was calculated for each of the 143 patients studied and was highly correlated with mortality rate (r = 0.99, p less than 0.001). Thus, the GTSS may serve as a valuable tool for evaluating death in geriatric trauma victims. Furthermore, because complications are potentially avoidable and contribute to increased mortality rates, routine aggressive care for geriatric patients with moderate overall injury is indicated.\r"

The adrenergic receptors were studied in terms of their responsiveness, a measure of the postreceptor mechanism, and their sensitivity, a measure of the receptor number or affinity. With early trauma, beta-adrenergic responsiveness and receptor number were significantly decreased. This is desensitization of the beta-receptors with down regulation and indicates increased in vivo lipolysis in early injury. After 4 days these changes had returned to normal. Early sepsis resulted in a significant increase in beta- and alpha-receptor responsiveness with beta-upregulation. This indicated hypersensitivity of the adipocyte adrenergic receptors and suggests the presence of an in vivo block of the adrenergic receptors in early sepsis. This would decrease adipocyte lipolysis. After 4 days there was a decrease in beta-receptor responsiveness in the patients with sepsis, indicating that the adrenergic receptor block was no longer present and adipocyte adrenergic stimulated lipolysis was increased.\r"

Peritoneal fluid, collected through an abdominal drain, and serum were also analyzed. At day 1 after operation, the mean concentration of the propeptide was 30 times higher than the mean preoperative serum level (2.5 micrograms/L). A significant increase (p less than 0.001) occurred at day 3 in the wound and at day 2 in peritoneal fluid. At day 5 the mean wound concentration (2670 micrograms/L) was 1000 times higher than the serum level. In serum a small but significant increase (p less than 0.05) was found at days 5 and 30. The increase in wound fluid resulted from the intact, liberated propeptide, indicating that the results reflect the synthesis of type III collagen deposited in the wound. This procedure offers a quantitative tool for wound healing studies. Other extracellular matrix components can also be measured, the sequential pattern of their appearance can thus be assessed, and disturbances and treatment effects in wound healing can be detected.\r"

However, where the defect is large or there is tension on the closure, the use of a prosthetic material is indicated. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patches were used to repair incisional hernias in 28 patients between November 1983 and December 1986. Twelve of these patients (43%) had a prior failure of a primary repair. Reherniation occurred in three patients (10.7%). Wound infections developed in two patients (7.1%), both of whom had existing intestinal stomas, one with an intercurrent pelvic abscess. The prosthetic patch was removed in the patient with the abscess, but the infection was resolved in the other without sequelae. Septic complications did not occur after any operations performed in uncontaminated fields. None of the patients exhibited any undue discomfort, wound pain, erythema, or induration. Complications related to adhesions, erosion of the patch material into the viscera, bowel obstruction, or fistula formation did not occur. Based on this clinical experience, the authors believe that the PTFE patch appears to represent an advance in synthetic abdominal wall substitutes.\r"

Body temperature, plasma cortisol and glucagon concentrations, blood glucose level, urinary catecholamine level, and urinary nitrogen excretion level were compared with those of 16 patients who did not receive indomethacin. Postoperative fever was significantly reduced by indomethacin. Plasma cortisol levels in the indomethacin-treated group were significantly lower on postoperative days 2 and 3. Postoperative increases in plasma glucagon and blood glucose levels were not influenced by indomethacin administration. Urinary epinephrine excretion tended to be inhibited, and urinary norepinephrine excretion was significantly inhibited in the indomethacin-treated group after operation. Urinary nitrogen excretion levels during the observation period were significantly less in the indomethacin-treated group. The cumulative urinary nitrogen level from postoperative days 1-3 in the indomethacin-treated group was 82% of that in the control group. These results indicated that fever reduction by indomethacin after surgery resulted in reduced protein loss, associated with attenuated cortisol and catecholamine responses.\r"

Over the last decade total thyroidectomy has become used increasingly and is now the preferred option in the authors' unit for the management of multinodular goiter affecting the entire gland. Over the period from 1975 to 1985, 853 thyroidectomies have been performed for multinodular goiter; of these, 115 have been total thyroidectomies. During that time, the incidence of total thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter has increased in percentage terms from 9% in 1975 to 50% in 1985. There have been two cases of permanent hypoparathyroidism and one case of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and these occurred in patients who had less than total thyroidectomy. Total thyroidectomy is an appropriate operation for the management of diffuse multinodular goiter where the entire gland is involved because it precludes patients from requiring further surgery for recurrent disease, with its high associated risks. It must be emphasized, however, that protection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and parathyroid glands must still be paramount in dealing with benign thyroid disease.\r"

Eighty-five per cent of the contractions were peristaltic and generated mean pressures of 28 mmHg. Fifteen per cent of the deglutitions were followed by nonpropulsive waves with mean pressures of 24 mmHg. Spontaneous tertiary activity occurred at a rate of 2.5 contractions per minute with an amplitude of 16 mmHg. Motor function in the excluded esophagus persists after bypass of the organ. This suggests that the excluded esophagus should be decompressed after surgery to prevent \"blowout\" of its closed ends.\r"

Cefazolin was significantly less effective than cefamandole at both the sternal (1.8% vs. 0.4%, respectively, p less than 0.05) and donor sites (1.3% vs. 0%, respectively, p less than 0.02). Seven Staphylococcus aureus infections occurred among cefazolin recipients as compared with no such infections among the patients receiving cefamandole (p less than 0.01). All five wound infections yielding fungi or gentamicin-resistant gram-negative rods occurred in patients who had received gentamicin as a second prophylactic agent. These data suggest that gentamicin has no role as a prophylactic antibiotic in cardiac surgery and that, compared with cefamandole, cefazolin offers unreliable prophylaxis against deep infection at both the sternal and donor sites.\r"

Thirty-eight left ventricular cryolesions were created in 19 dogs, which were then killed from 3 to 35 days after injury. A consistent decrease in the depth of scar (p less than 0.005) and accumulation of collagen (p less than 0.0001) over time characterized this healing myocardial wound. Histologic examination revealed that the cellular pattern of healing myocardial cryolesions is similar to that of a healing myocardial infarction but with less variability. The authors advocate the use of cardiac cryolesions as a model of experimental myocardial wound healing.\r"

The authors reviewed their experience with 91 extremity arterial injuries in which autogenous tissue was used to repair vascular injuries of the extremities. Twenty-two patients also had concomitant repair of associated venous injuries with autogenous vein grafts. Ten patients required amputations, despite patent grafts in five patients, because of severe muscle necrosis. Two patients had thrombosis of their vein grafts develop in the early postoperative period but did not require amputation. The authors identified only one late vein graft failure in a patient in whom an infected pseudoaneurysm developed. Three patients with extensive soft tissue injuries had infection develop in vein grafts, with subsequent massive bleeding that ultimately required arterial ligation. Among the 22 patients with repair of their venous injuries, occlusion of popliteal vein repairs was documented in two patients and suspected in three others. The remainder of patients had satisfactory results. The excellent results obtained in the vast majority of the authors' patients with extremity vascular injuries reinforces their preference for using autogenous tissue whenever a vascular conduit is required. Exceptions include patients with extensive soft tissue loss precluding adequate graft coverage, the repair of large vessels, and life-threatening emergencies when there is insufficient time to harvest and prepare a vein.\r"

Eight models (330, 330A, 330B, 330C, 332, 340, 341, and 342) were used during a 54-month period ending December, 1974, and 100 consecutive surviving patients were evaluated for subsequent bioprosthetic valve failure and prosthesis-related complications by annual clinic examinations and serial hemodynamic studies. Actuarial patient survival was 76 +/- 4%, 51 +/- 5%, and 30 +/- 6% after 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Intrinsic valve failure, defined as structural degeneration of bioprosthetic tissue or stent geometry alteration or both, in the absence of prior infection, occurred in 23 patients. The linear occurrence rate of bioprosthetic valve failure was 0.2%, 5%, and 15% per patient-year, and it affected 1 patient, 14 patients, and 8 patients at sequential 5-year milestones. The actuarial freedom from valve failure was 99 +/- 1%, 75 +/- 6%, 58 +/- 8%, and 40 +/- 12% after 5, 10, 12, and 14 years, respectively. The valve durability of early Hancock bioprostheses (models 330 through 341; N = 39) was not appreciably different from that of the current model 342 valves (N = 61). However, an increased incidence of intrinsic valve failure was observed for the first polypropylene-stented valve type (model 330) compared with the currently available model 342 valve (8/16, 50%, versus 12/61, 20%; p = 0.034). The yearly occurrence rate of prosthesis-related complications remained constant, but the rate of intrinsic valve failure increased in a progressive, nonlinear fashion. The high intrinsic failure rate of the Hancock porcine bioprosthesis after 10 to 12 years has moderated our initial enthusiasm for this valve in the mitral position, and has resulted in more frequent implantations of mechanical valve substitutes at this institution.\r"

  ".W": "The introduction of cis-platinum-based chemotherapy has dramatically improved the prognosis for patients with primary nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the mediastinum. Since 1978, 12 male patients (mean age, 29 years) have been seen with a large mediastinal mass, normal testes, and abnormal testicular tumor markers. Eleven patients had raised alpha-fetoprotein levels (median, 1,300 micrograms/L; normal, less than 10 micrograms/L), and 3 had elevated levels of the beta fraction of human chorionic gonadotropin (median, 8,000 IU/L; normal, less than 5 IU/L). Two patients were treated by primary surgical intervention followed by chemotherapy. Ten patients were treated with primary chemotherapy (cis-platinum, vinblastine sulfate or etoposide, and bleomycin sulfate), and this was followed by timed surgical excision of the tumor mass in 7. Six (60%) patients responded to primary chemotherapy with normalization of tumor markers. In this group there was 1 postoperative death and 1 recurrence. The 4 remaining patients are alive and free from disease at a mean of five years. Of the 4 patients with persistently elevated tumor markers, 2 died within six months, 1 is alive with recurrence, and 1 is lost to follow-up at three months. Patients whose tumor markers return to normal after cis-platinum-based chemotherapy have a good long-term prognosis following radical surgery. If the tumor markers remain elevated, the prognosis is poor.\r"

  ".W": "We retrospectively reviewed the records of 41 patients with an isolated anterior mediastinal mass to identify whether the traditional surgical approach of resection for both diagnosis and therapy is the optimal approach to these tumors. In addition to plain chest radiographs, clinical evaluation included computed tomography (CT) in 23 and gallium scintigraphy in 23. The initial intervention was attempted excisional therapy in 16 and mediastinoscopy for biopsy in 25. Pathological diagnoses included lymphoma (13), thymoma (11), germ cell tumor (6), carcinoid (2), bronchogenic carcinoma (2), and other benign processes (7). Based on histological findings, nonoperative therapy was the most appropriate treatment in 61%. The clinical selection of the surgical approach was not aided by patient age, symptoms, or findings on CT. The gallium scan was positive in 13 of 15 patients for whom nonoperative therapy was appropriate, and was normal in 7 of 8 for whom excision was indicated. Mediastinoscopy is useful in the diagnosis of anterior mediastinal masses, and may eliminate unnecessary thoracotomy, especially when a gallium scan is positive.\r"

  ".U": "88076218\r", 
  ".W": "The metabolic and physiological alterations associated with changes in myocardial tissue electrical resistivity during ischemia were characterized to assess the feasibility of using such resistivity as an on-line indicator of the onset of ischemic injury. Twelve anesthetized dogs underwent rapid cardiac extirpation; 5 served as untreated controls, and 7 were pretreated with metoprolol tartrate. Beta blockade was used to alter the time course of ischemic injury as demonstrated previously in studies using this experimental model. In vitro measurement of myocardial resistivity, the detection of ischemic contracture, and serial measurements of tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and lactate were obtained from totally ischemic left ventricles at 37 degrees C. Myocardial resistivity began to increase significantly before onset of ischemic contracture in the untreated control group (resistivity at 42.3 +/- 3.1 minutes, contracture at 53.8 +/- 3.7 minutes; p less than 0.025) as well as the metoprolol group (resistivity at 50.7 +/- 1.5 minutes, contracture at 70.0 +/- 3.5 minutes; p less than 0.005). As expected, ischemic contracture was delayed in the beta-blocked group compared with controls (p less than 0.01). Similarly, the onset of myocardial resistivity increase was delayed in the beta-blocked group (p less than 0.025). ATP and lactate levels at the onset of myocardial resistivity increase were consistent with severe but reversible injury. Resistivity changes during ischemia correlated linearly with simultaneous ATP depletion and lactate accumulation (r = 0.88 to 0.98; p less than 0.05). Furthermore, during global ischemia studied in 3 anesthetized dogs in vivo, the onset of myocardial resistivity increase occurred after 20 minutes. Finally, 6 anesthetized dogs underwent 60 minutes of in vivo regional ischemia by coronary artery occlusion, followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Myocardial resistivity in the ischemic region increased immediately and steadily after coronary occlusion, followed by a rapid decrease during subsequent reperfusion. These data show that myocardial resistivity may be useful for identifying severe but still reversible ischemic injury in on-line fashion during regional and global myocardial ischemia.\r"

Age ranged from 1 week to 4 years (median, 8 weeks) and weight, from 1.1 to 16 kg (median, 4 kg). The patients were divided into three major groups: Group 1, defects without mixing disorders (ventricular septal defect, double-outlet right ventricle [DORV], atrioventricular septal defect); Group 2, defects with mixing disorders (transposition of the great arteries, DORV, single ventricle, tricuspid atresia); and Group 3, miscellaneous (mitral atresia, left ventricular hypoplasia, truncus complex). The diagnostic group influenced survival (p = 0.0035). In Group 1, 88.8% survived, but only 64.9% survived in Groups 2 and 3 combined. The presence of patent ductus arteriosus or coarctation of the aorta had no effect on survival (p = 0.61 and p = 0.7, respectively). The clinical condition at thirty days after pulmonary artery banding was good in 35.1% and fair in 46.9% of the patients. When the data were divided into the three periods 1971 through 1974, 1975 through 1979, and 1980 through 1984, which included 28, 49, and 67 patients, respectively, a significant improvement in survival was observed from the early (64.3%) to the late period (92.5%) (p = 0.0009). Patients weighing less than 4 kg had a significantly lower survival in the period 1971 through 1974 (37.5% versus 91.67%). No significant difference in survival was detected in the late period, 1980 to 1984 (90% versus 94.6%), between patients weighing less than and those weighing more than 4 kg. Pulmonary artery banding is clinically satisfactory in small infants and children with complex anomalies.\r"

Ten had pulmonary valve stenosis, 4 had pulmonary valve stenosis plus ventricular septal defect, 8 had tetralogy of Fallot, and 2 had complex lesions. Propranolol (0.01 to 0.2 mg per kilogram of body weight) was given to patients with a residual right ventricular to left ventricular systolic pressure ratio greater than 0.75. Four children did not respond to propranolol and required further surgical intervention. Twenty patients responded, 2 of whom died. Fifteen were restudied by cardiac catheterization 3 weeks to 27 months postoperatively. The right ventricle-pulmonary artery gradient was 25 mm Hg or less in 13 patients. We conclude that a small dose of propranolol given intraoperatively can identify patients in whom a reduction in the right ventricle-pulmonary artery gradient to acceptable levels will occur in the months following operation. This may reduce the need for placement of a subannular or transannular patch in some patients.\r"

A reduction of the mortality rate over time has been observed. For the period 1975 to 1980, the mortality rate was 41% (seven of 17). In contrast, for the period 1981 to 1985, the mortality rate decreased to 17% (four of 24).

The ranitidine/aspirin group had significantly less mucosal damage in the stomach and duodenum than the placebo/aspirin group.

Data from a prospective study of 232 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery were used to examine the effect of methodologic differences in assembly of population, postoperative surveillance, and the criteria for cardiac complications on the performance of Goldman's cardiac risk index. Our prospective population was used to simulate the methods used in Goldman's study and in three other studies using the risk index to demonstrate the potential impact of differences in population, surveillance, and outcome criteria for cardiac complications. If Goldman's detection and outcome criteria were employed and only the eligibility criteria used for assembly of the populations differed, the overall complication rates would be between 5.2% and 6.9%; and the complication rates for the different Goldman classes were similar. When both different detection strategies and different outcome criteria were used, however, important discrepancies in cardiac complication rates emerged. For example, complication rates in class 2 varied from 2% to 23%. In conclusion, important discrepancies in performance of prognostic indexes may arise from differences in surveillance strategies and definitions of outcome. With sufficient attention to methodologic consistency, the performance of predictive indexes may not inevitably deteriorate in subsequent studies.\r"

Dermanyssus gallinae, a nonburrowing, blood-sucking avian mite was identified on the patient and his bedding. A second patient who complained of scalp pruritus had mites present on her pillow and bed linen. The intern taking care of both patients, and two nurses who had contact with these patients, had mite infestation. Pigeons roosting on the air conditioners and near the doors connecting the patients' rooms to a sunporch were the source of the mites. The outbreak abated after control measures were instituted that prevented pigeons from roosting on the porch. This outbreak illustrates an unusual cause of nosocomial pruritic dermatitis that may be misdiagnosed as scabies or pediculosis. Physicians and health care personnel working in metropolitan areas are alerted to mites as a cause of pruritic dermatitis that may be chronic, recurrent, or unresponsive to ectoparasiticides.\r"

Data on the Psychiatric Screening Inventory were obtained from mothers at times 1 and 2. Additionally, at time 2 the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children was administered to the children themselves. At follow-up, the siblings' picture according to mothers' assessment appears worse than it did initially: In addition to the excess in aggressive symptoms seen at time 1, they manifested an excess in depressive affect and social isolation. The time 2 interviews with the children themselves show that the siblings scored significantly higher than controls on depressive symptoms, although the rate of DSM-III major depression was not significantly different. An excess in depressive symptoms was observed also in mothers of disabled children, who, like the siblings, were not at increased risk for major depression.\r"

Analysis of variance revealed significant differences by exposure but not by sex, ethnicity, or age. Additional analyses were conducted of individual item response, overall severity of PTSD reaction, symptom grouping, and previous life events. The results provide strong evidence that acute PTSD symptoms occur in school-age children with a notable correlation between proximity to the violence and type and number of PTSD symptoms. Sampling at approximately one month after the trauma provided adequate delineation among exposure groups. The symptom profile of highly exposed children lends validity to the diagnosis of acute PTSD in childhood.\r"

There are many potential sources of disagreement that have nothing to do with the validity of either the lay or the psychiatrist examination. Another approach to comparing lay and psychiatrist diagnoses is to examine their relative predictive power. We describe such a comparison using outcome variables derived from the one-year follow-up examination of Epidemiologic Catchment Area respondents done at the St. Louis site. We examine several outcome variables across nine diagnostic categories. Within the limits of the available data, lay and psychiatrist diagnoses appear to be essentially equal in terms of the number of outcomes better predicted and few of the differences in predictive power approach statistical significance. We discuss the implications of these findings for the analysis of lay interviewer Diagnostic Interview Schedule-derived diagnoses.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical studies of monoamine neurotransmitter function in depression have concentrated on individual monoamines without focusing on interactions between monoamine systems. Virtually all modern studies have found significant correlations between monoamine metabolite concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These correlations should in part reflect interactions between central monoamine systems. In the present analysis, CSF had been obtained from depressed patients before (n = 40) and after (n = 36) antidepressant treatment. The patients were grouped based on their response to treatment. Absolute concentrations of CSF monoamine metabolites (homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol) did not differ between the two groups before or after treatment. However, when correlations between metabolites were compared, nonresponders to treatment differed considerably from responders. In responders, as in previously described normal populations, all three metabolites correlated with one another before and after treatment, and treatment-induced changes in metabolite concentrations also correlated with one another. In contrast, metabolites in nonresponders did not correlate with one another before treatment, nor did treatment-induced changes correlate with one another in this group. Furthermore, correlations between treatment-induced changes in metabolites differed significantly between responders and nonresponders, and there was a trend for pretreatment correlations to differ as well. The lack of correlation between monoamine metabolites in nonresponders suggests that interactions between monoamine systems may be disrupted in these individuals. Using CSF metabolite correlations to study neurotransmitter interactions may have clinical relevance and yields information not available from examining neurotransmitters in isolation.\r"
