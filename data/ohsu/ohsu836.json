  ".W": "The nervous system is frequently involved in patients with infective endocarditis. When a careful review of presenting complaints is undertaken, neurological symptoms have been found in as high as 29% of patients. Because these manifestations may be so protean in nature, for example, stroke or transient ischaemic attack (the most common), toxic encephalopathy, meningitis, brain abscess, visual loss, seizures, headache, backache, or acute mononeuropathy, the neurologist needs to consider infective endocarditis as a possible diagnosis in many patients. During the past two decades, infective endocarditis has occurred in an ever widening clinical setting. It may often be found in persons unknown to have predisposing cardiac disease. This is particularly true in certain subsets of the population, including the elderly, patients subjected to various invasive procedures leading to nosocomial infection, and drug abusers. New diagnostic studies, including refined bacteriological culture techniques, echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and greater availability of skillful cerebral angiography, make earlier diagnosis of infective endocarditis possible. Despite this, patients with neurological complications continue to have an uncertain prognosis.\r"

We have reviewed the Japanese literature in an effort to determine what factors explain this difference. It appears that the survival differences are due mainly to a greater frequency of early gastric cancer in Japan; meticulous histopathologic evaluation of the surgical specimens, resulting in more accurate pathologic staging; and the presumed benefit of extended nodal dissection when it extends outside of the level of node-positive disease. Although patients with both apparent and confirmed direct adjacent organ invasion can be helped by resection of those organs, extended resections of uninvolved pancreas and spleen do not improve rate of survival beyond the benefit of improved nodal dissection. Overall, there would appear to be justification for reexamining extended nodal dissection for gastric cancer in the US. Opportunities for a meaningful national study are significant.\r"

Both tumors showed a part pleomorphic pattern and a part myxoid spindle cell sarcomatous pattern. An electron microscopic examination showed some tonofilament-like bundles of intermediate filaments and cell junctions in one case, suggesting the presence of epithelial differentiation in that tumor. An immunohistochemical analysis showed a large number of cytokeratin-positive neoplastic cells in both cases as studied with two different monoclonal antibodies, and most cells were positive for vimentin. No cells showed desmin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, or epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Due to the presence of cytokeratin immunoreactivity, the possibility was considered that these tumors would represent anaplastic sarcomatoid variants of hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor cells showed cytoplasmic alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) positivity, and were negative for alpha-fetoprotein. Because the immunoreactivity of AAT is widespread in different types of tumors, it is not possible to conclude that the AAT positivity would indicate the hepatoma nature of USL; however, this remains a possibility, especially when considering that in vitro transformed hepatocytes have been shown to be capable of forming sarcomatous tumors.\r"

Viral DNA was detected by in situ hybridization using 35S-labeled nick translated DNA probes in 50 of 70 cases (71%) which had adequate lesions: HPV-16 in 30, HPV-18 in ten, HPV-31 in six, and multiple types in four cases. HPV-6/11 was detected only once, in a multiple infection. As a rule, a positive cervix contained a single virus type, and the same virus type was found in condylomatous and neoplastic areas. The results suggest that the neoplastic process is initiated in the area of condyloma toward the endocervix and, once established, extends proximally toward the cervical canal. Capsid antigen was detected in 19 cases, indicating that a proportion of the high-grade lesions is potentially infectious.\r"

Twenty-five episodes were due to a transient exacerbation of the underlying hepatitis and 11 of these episodes were followed by a loss of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) from serum and a remission in disease. Two patients were found to have hepatocellular carcinoma. No apparent cause could be found in a further two episodes of AFP elevation. In comparison to 144 patients with normal levels, the 22 with AFP elevations were more likely to have cirrhosis (61% versus 13%, P = 0.01), to die a liver-related death (27% versus 0.7%, P = 0.0007) and to have hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (9% versus 0%, P = 0.002). These findings confirm that AFP can be used to screen for HCC in high-risk patients with chronic hepatitis B. The majority of AFP elevations, however, will be found to be due to exacerbations of disease, with or without loss of HBeAg from serum, especially in white patients with severe disease and cirrhosis.\r"

By light and electron microscopy, the cultured cells showed the morphologic features of adenocarcinoma characterized by gland-like structures, intracellular microcystic spaces, and mucous production. Immunoperoxidase stains showed that FU-GBC-1 cells expressed several epithelial tumor antigens including CA 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). The cell strain has been in continuous culture up to passage 44 for 1 1/2 years, with the population doubling time of 120 hours. The cytogenetic analysis by a G-band technique showed a constant loss of chromosome Y in FU-GBC-1 cells. The modal chromosome number at passage 12 was 82 with a range of 77 to 85. Flow cytometry with an ethidium bromide technique additionally confirmed aneuploid DNA content (4C) in the cultured cells at passage 12 and 35. Inoculation of FU-GBC-1 cells into the dermis of BALB/c nude mice produced transplantable adenocarcinoma identical to the original tumor. Because no continuous cell lines of the well-differentiated type of gallbladder adenocarcinoma have been reported in the literature currently, the newly established cell strain we report may yield a useful system for studying the morphologic and biologic characteristics of gallbladder adenocarcinoma.\r"

The LI was below 3.0 in 60% of the adenocarcinomas. When the LI was analyzed according to the cytologic subtypes of adenocarcinoma, the values were low for goblet cell type and type II alveolar cell type, whereas the values for the bronchial surface epithelial cell type varied widely (average, 5.2) and those for the Clara cell type were intermediate (average, 1.8). A comparison of the LI with TNM classification, histologic differentiation, degree of nuclear atypia, and mitotic cell count showed a correlation between the LI and each of these prognostic factors. Thus, the possibility of the BrdU LI being a useful new prognostic factor of pulmonary adenocarcinomas was suggested.\r"

The calculation model uses orthogonal coordinates, an internal reference system, and the concept of nonuniform reduction of the cavity, with its obliteration at the apex. From a normal patient population (ten males, four females; aged 45 +/- 13 years), a \"normal reference curve\" of contraction was obtained. A second patient group (56 males, two females, aged 56 +/- 7 years) with definite contraction abnormalities was then analyzed. A third group (eight males, one female, aged 56 +/- 10 years) was studied before and after nifedipine administration (1 mg over 2 min IV). Specific algorithms compare individual patient contraction curves with the normal reference curve and compute the score point system of contraction analysis. Data are automatically codified and filed during introduction. This saves time and allows a rapid retrieval of data grouped under different coded features. These features include the location and type of wall contraction abnormalities. This method of reading ventriculograms has been shown to be in accordance with the diagnosis of experienced observers and can detect small contraction changes that are induced pharmacologically. The method is proposed as a valuable tool for semiobjective evaluation of left ventricle wall contraction and to facilitate data collection in multicenter collaborative studies.\r"

  ".U": "90030743\r", 
  ".W": "To clarify the characteristics of the phasic blood velocity pattern in small arteries and veins on the left atrial surface, we used our newly developed fiber-optic laser Doppler velocimeter. We intended particularly to examine the influence of atrial contraction and relaxation on velocity waveforms to obtain some insight into the nature of the mechanical force acting on the atrial intramyocardial vascular beds. In 14 anesthetized open-chest dogs, the left atrial appendage was gently displaced to expose small branches of the artery and vein. Vessels with an outer diameter of about 150-500 microns were chosen for the measurements because their walls are transparent to laser light. The fiber tip (velocity sensor) was fixed on the vessel surface with a drop of cyanoacrylate when good-quality Doppler signals were consistently observed. Additional experiments with three dogs were performed to observe the blood velocities in the atrial artery and vein during arrhythmia. The blood velocity waveform in the artery was similar to the pattern of aortic pressure during ventricular ejection (peak velocity, 18.8 +/- 7.8 cm/sec) but was characterized by a pronounced dip during atrial contraction. The temporal coincidence between the dip formation and atrial contraction was confirmed during atrial flutter with an atrioventricular block. After isoproterenol administration (2 micrograms i.v.), the acceleration rate of the forward flow velocity increased by 176% (p less than 0.05), and reverse flow appeared during atrial contraction in five cases out of eight (p = 0.013). The blood flow velocity in atrial small veins, on the other hand, was predominant during atrial contraction (peak velocity, 15.6 +/- 5.8 cm/sec). Isoproterenol increased the acceleration rate of this forward flow velocity by 121% (p less than 0.01). Nitroglycerin did not change the blood velocity waveform significantly in atrial arteries or in veins. The phase opposition between arterial inflow into and venous outflow from the atrial myocardium indicates that a large portion of the coronary inflow to the atrial myocardium may be stored due to the presence of atrial myocardial vascular capacitance. We conclude that atrial myocardial contraction impedes atrial inflow and promotes venous outflow from atrial capacitance vessels.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effects of endothelin, a newly discovered very potent vasoconstrictor secreted by endothelial cells, on the coronary vascular bed. For this purpose, the effects of endothelin injected intracoronarily were tested in open-chest anesthetized dogs with the circumflex coronary artery cannulated and perfused at a constant pressure of 100 mm Hg. Circumflex blood flow, transmural distribution of coronary blood flow (radioactive microspheres), circumflex coronary artery diameter (piezoelectric crystals), and circumflex luminal surface area were measured. Endothelin decreased coronary blood flow by 30% and 61% with doses of 1 and 3 micrograms, respectively. A dose of 10 micrograms was lethal. The decrease of coronary blood flow was larger in the subepicardium than in the subendocardium, which explains that the endocardial-epicardial blood flow ratio increased from 1.27 +/- 0.05 to 1.98 +/- 0.23 (p less than 0.001) with a dose of 3 micrograms endothelin. Circumflex surface area decreased by 7% (p = NS) and 20% (p less than 0.01) with doses of 1 and 3 micrograms endothelin, respectively. The action of endothelin was not modified by the concomitant alpha-adrenergic blockade, serotonergic blockade, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, or cyclooxygenase inhibition. We conclude that endothelin is a potent coronary vasoconstrictor with a selective effect on the subepicardium. At least part of the increase of coronary vascular resistance is due to a constriction of the large coronary arteries. Further studies are required to determine the physiopathological role of endothelin, especially in coronary vasospasm.\r"

  ".W": "The heart contains superficial cardiac nerves whose effects may be modulated by pericardial fluid bathing the epicardium. We tested this hypothesis in open-chest dogs anesthetized with secobarbital. Oxygenated normal Tyrode's solution (NT) or NT containing hexamethonium, a ganglionic blocker (500 microM), or tetrodotoxin, a blocker of axonal neurotransmission (5 microM, TTX), was instilled into the pericardial cavity to superfuse the epicardium of the whole heart. During each superfusion, effective refractory period (ERP) was determined in deep intramyocardium (greater than or equal to 4 mm in depth from the epicardium) of anterior and posterior left ventricle and in the subendocardium of the right ventricle in the baseline state and during bilateral cervical vagal stimulation (VS) or ansae subclaviae stimulation (SS). Lengthening of ERP induced by VS during superfusion with NT (6.9 +/- 0.3 msec, mean +/- SEM, n = 36) was eliminated during subsequent superfusion with hexamethonium (0.9 +/- 0.5 msec, p less than 0.001). Hexamethonium also prevented sinus arrest induced by VS but did not affect shortening of ERP induced by SS (17.3 +/- 1.3 to 16.6 +/- 1.0 msec, n = 26). TTX suppressed VS-induced changes in ERP (6.3 +/- 0.3 to 1.5 +/- 0.5 msec, n = 32, p less than 0.001) and SS-induced changes in ERP (18.8 +/- 1.6 to 6.0 +/- 0.9 msec, n = 23, p less than 0.001) but did not affect changes in ERP induced by intravenous administration of norepinephrine or methacholine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of endothelin on systemic and renal hemodynamics in anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats were examined. Endothelin (500 ng i.v. +1,000 ng/hr per 300-g rat) elevated mean blood pressure by 13% (p less than 0.02) and decreased renal blood flow by 71% and glomerular filtration rate by 66% (both p less than 0.01), resulting in a 430% (p less than 0.05) increase in renal vascular resistance (RVR) in SHR. This rise in blood pressure was associated with a significant increase in hematocrit (+8%), but a decrease in urinary sodium excretion (-51%). This dose of endothelin reduced cardiac output by 40% (p less than 0.001) and brought about a 96% (p less than 0.01) rise in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). However, the SVR increase was significantly smaller than the RVR increase. These changes in systemic and renal hemodynamics were observed in a dose-dependent manner, and the degrees of change did not differ between the two strains. Additional infusion of atrial natriuretic peptide (0.33 microgram/kg/min) into SHR completely reversed the changes in blood pressure and renal hemodynamics caused by endothelin, resulting in pronounced natriuresis (+760%). The renal vascular casting study revealed that endothelin mainly constricted the arcuate and interlobular arteries, as well as afferent arterioles. These results suggest that endothelin may be involved in blood pressure and body fluid volume regulation through systemic and renal vasoconstriction.\r"

Any total plasma cholesterol level above an ideal of 180 mg/dl (and an LDL cholesterol level of 100 mg/dl) must be considered atherogenic in the presence of other risk factors. In patients at high risk for death from CAD, combined diet and drug therapy should have as a goal the attainment of ideal lipoprotein values.

  ".W": "Oxygen free radicals are known to be generated during periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion. There is still some controversy, however, concerning the use of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to accurately detect and identify the free radical species that are formed. There is no doubt that oxygen radicals are deleterious to the myocardium; free radicals cause left ventricular dysfunction and structural damage to myocytes and endothelial cells in both in vitro and in vivo preparations. Potential sources of these cytotoxic oxygen species include the xanthine oxidase pathway, activated neutrophils, mitochondria, and arachidonate metabolism, yet the crucial source of free radicals in the setting of ischemia and reperfusion is unresolved. There is little doubt that oxygen radicals play a role in the phenomenon of stunned myocardium induced by brief periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion; numerous studies have consistently observed that pretreatment with free radical scavengers and antioxidants enhances contractile function of stunned, postischemic tissue. Whether oxygen free radical scavengers administered only during reperfusion enhance recovery of stunned myocardium in models of brief ischemia remains to be determined. In models of prolonged ischemia (2 hours) followed by reperfusion, we have not observed a beneficial effect of scavengers on stunned myocardium. The issue of whether oxygen free radical scavengers are capable of reducing so-called irreversible or lethal reperfusion injury remains, in our opinion, unresolved. Although some studies have observed that agents such as superoxide dismutase and catalase reduce infarct size in ischemia and reperfusion models, many others have reported negative results. Additional studies will be needed to resolve this ongoing controversy. Oxygen free radicals may also contribute to reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in rodent heart preparations; however, less data are available in other animal models. The concept of reperfusion injury should not be considered a deterrent to reperfusion for the treatment of acute myocardial infarcts in the clinical setting. Thrombolytic therapy reduces myocardial infarct size, enhances recovery of left ventricular function, and improves survival. Whether incremental beneficial effects on these parameters will be obtained when oxygen radical-scavenging agents are used as adjuvant therapy to thrombolysis in patients remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated medical in comparison to surgical plus medical (surgical) treatment of unstable angina using a prospective randomized protocol that stratified patients by clinical presentation and by invasive evaluation of left ventricular (LV) function. Clinical presentations were as follows--type 1: progressive or new onset angina relieved by medication; type 2: prolonged bouts of angina poorly or incompletely relieved by medication. Abnormal LV function was arbitrarily defined as ejection fraction less than 0.50 or LV end-diastolic pressure 16 mm Hg or more. Of 468 patients, 237 were assigned to medical and 231 to surgical therapy. There were 374 type 1 and 94 type 2 patients. LV function was normal in 334 and abnormal in 134 patients. Compared with results at 24 months, this 60-month follow-up study showed important differences in survival for patients with three-vessel disease: 75% for medical and 89% for surgical patients (p less than 0.02). The cumulative 5-year rate of repeat hospitalizations for cardiac reasons was less with surgical patients for either clinical presentation. For type 1, medical patients had a 56% rate, and surgical patients had a 42% rate (p = 0.004). For type 2, medical patients had a 62% rate, and surgical patients had a 43% rate (p = 0.05). Overall mortality did not differ between the two treatments, and this remained true in type 1 versus type 2 patients and in those with normal versus abnormal LV function. However, regression analysis of medical and surgical groups with ejection fraction as a continuous variable showed that mortality of medical patients depended on ejection fraction (p = 0.004), whereas the mortality of surgical patients did not (p = 0.76), and survival in the surgical group was higher in the lowest ejection fraction tercile-73% for medical and 86% for surgical patients, p = 0.03. We conclude that surgery improves survival in patients with three-vessel disease and leads to fewer subsequent hospitalizations for cardiac reasons. An impaired ejection fraction had an adverse impact on survival of medical patients but not on surgical patients, and mortality in surgical patients was improved compared with medical patients in the lowest ejection fraction tercile.\r"

Therapy with dipyridamole and sulfinpyrazone was started 48 hours before bypass graft surgery, and aspirin treatment was begun 12 hours before surgery as a single 325-mg dose. Postoperative treatment was started 6 hours after surgery and continued for 1 year. Graft patency data were obtained early (median, 9 days) and late (median, 367 days) after surgery. The early graft occlusion rate was decreased with all aspirin treatment regimens compared with that of the placebo regimen. At 1 year, in 406 patients with 1,315 grafts, the graft occlusion rate in all of the aspirin groups combined was 15.8% compared with 22.6% for the placebo group (p = 0.029). The patients taking aspirin once daily had a lower occlusion rate (13.2%) compared with the patients receiving placebo (p = 0.050). At 1 year, in the vein grafts placed to vessels less than or equal to 2.0 mm in diameter (804 distal sites), the graft occlusion rate in all of the aspirin groups was 20.1% compared with 32.3% for the placebo group (p = 0.008). In the vein grafts placed to vessels greater than 2.0 mm in diameter (511 distal sites), there was no difference in the occlusion rates between aspirin and the placebo group at 1 year (8.7% vs. 9.0%, p = 0.918).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The indications for biventricular versus left ventricular mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to cardiac transplantation are not well established. In this study, 27 potential heart transplant candidates who were in imminent risk of dying before donor heart procurement were implanted with Thoratec prosthetic ventricles (21 biventricular and six left ventricular) at three medical centers. A total of 21 patients (16 biventricular and five left ventricular) underwent successful cardiac transplantation after 1-65 days of circulatory support, and 19 were discharged from the hospital. Seven of the patients (all biventricular; diagnoses: four cardiomyopathy, two acute myocardial infarction, one end-stage coronary artery disease plus acute myocardial infarction) had prolonged arrhythmias that normally would have been lethal (six cases of ventricular fibrillation from 2 to 22 days, one asystole for 3 hours), but complete support of the systemic and pulmonary circulations was maintained in all seven patients with biventricular devices. Mean systemic blood flow during this period (4.6 +/- 0.6 l/min) was unchanged compared with that during sinus rhythm. Six of these patients survived to receive heart transplants. The use of right plus left prosthetic ventricles does not prevent the occurrence of arrhythmias but removes the threat and simplifies patient management. We conclude that biventricular support is indicated in bridge-to-transplant patients with potentially lethal arrhythmias.\r"

However, it is not known whether blood flow through the major conduit vessel of the leg, the common femoral artery (CFA), increases with exercise training. We tested the hypothesis that peak CFA blood flow will increase with a supervised, lengthy, and individualized exercise training program. Subjects were 10 IC patients (eight men, two women) with a mean age of 61 +/- 7 (mean +/- SD) years who had either aortoiliac (n = 7) or femoropopliteal (n = 3) stenosis. Using noninvasive Doppler flowmetry, we measured CFA blood flow and ankle pressure at rest and after a maximum symptom-limited graded treadmill test before (T1) and after 3 (T2) and 5 (T3) months of exercise training. Variables were measured in the supine and upright postures at rest and during recovery. Total walking distance and claudication distance on the treadmill were determined for T1, T2, and T3. After training, CFA blood flow and ankle pressure were not significantly higher at rest or at 1 minute after exercise compared with pretraining despite significant increases in claudication and total walking distances. The rate of CFA blood flow recovery was slower at T3, suggesting the accrual of a larger metabolic debt during exercise due to more work performed. We conclude that changes in CFA blood flow are not responsible for measured changes in performance with exercise training in IC patients.\r"

This regimen results in severe side effects, both metabolically and with respect to the risk of infection. In a prospective and a more comprehensive retrospective clinical study, we investigated the effect of a 50% reduction in that dosage. A total of 512 positive biopsies were analyzed in 128 patients. Of these, 64 patients (120 biopsies) in group 1 received 500 mg/day for 3 days while the remaining 107 patients (392 biopsies) in group 2 were treated with 1,000 mg/day for 3 days (43 patients belonged to both groups 1 and 2). Response to treatment was assessed by control biopsies in a standardized time period until the next biopsy-proven rejection (maximum of 10 biopsies). The results in short and longer follow-up periods, considering the incidence and a newer empirical numerical grading scale, have demonstrated clearly comparable effects of myocardial histology. Reduced dosage of steroids is feasible and safe, and a decrease in steroid-related side effects can be achieved without jeopardizing the graft.\r"

In 96 patients with non-obstructive chronic pyelonephritis, Escherichia coli strains were isolated and their virulence properties studied. Most frequently hemolysin formation and mannose-resistant hemagglutination (n = 39/40%), less frequently the ability to produce hydroxamate/aerobactin (n = 18/19%) and the K 1-antigen (n = 13/14%) were detected. In 34 E. coli strains (35%) two and more virulence factors were found. A statistically significant correlation exists between mannose-resistant hemagglutination (evidence of P- and F7-F14 fimbriae) and hemolysin formation on the one hand and hydroxamate production and K 1-antigen on the other (confidence intervals are 0.56-0.75 and 0.75-0.89, respectively). Disease activity and pathogenicity of E. coli strains showed a statistically significant association (chi 2-value, DF 1: hemolysin 29.5, mannose-resistant hemagglutination 17.1, K 1-antigen 4.8, hydroxamate 0.5). The analysis of the plasmid profile yielded species in molecular weight range from 0-170 Md. A correlation between single virulence features and certain plasmid combinations failed to be demonstrated. The results revealed a close connection between certain virulence properties of E. coli strains and a specific uropathogenicity. The clinical significance of this observation should be further elucidated.\r"

In sharp contrast to their progression during dialysis, cysts did not increase in size and no new cysts appeared during follow-up. However, despite a successful graft, none of the 34 cysts regressed significantly. The stability of the bone cysts may reflect either the poor solubility of the beta 2-m amyloid deposits or the limited accessibility of bone deposits to lytic factors. A longer follow-up will perhaps be necessary to document a significant regression of the cysts. Strikingly, transplantation resulted within a few days in an almost complete relief of articular complaints; in the absence of evidence of amyloid regression, this probably reflects the anti-inflammatory effect of steroids.\r"

A protocol was employed to (1) document a series of hematologic events surrounding cemented TKA and the alterations of these events by the study drugs and (2) compare the safety and efficacy of a regimen of antithrombin III/low-dose heparin (ATIII/LDH) to that of low-molecular-weight dextran (LMWD) in the prevention of DVT after TKA. Using a dosage regimen of 3000 units of ATIII as a loading dose followed postoperatively by 2000 units daily combined with 5000 units of LDH twice daily, a prospective randomized study of patients treated by cemented TKA was performed. The ATIII/LDH regimen was compared with LMWD (10 ml/kg x 12 hours loading dose followed by 7 ml/kg x 24 hours maintenance dose). The rate of DVT after TKA in 42 patients was 25% (5/20) for the ATIII/LDH group versus 82% (18/22) for the LMWD group (p less than 0.001). Bleeding complications were minimal and comparable for each group. Hematologic studies demonstrated that quantitative and functional ATIII levels decreased after TKA and that preoperative loading with ATIII prevented levels from falling below 100%. Studies of clot formation (fibrinopeptide A) and plasmin activity (fibrinopeptides B beta 15-42 and 1-42) in 34 patients suggest some reduction in procoagulant activity in patients in the ATIII/LDH group. These findings indicate that the combination of ATIII and LDH may offer superior protection from DVT than does LMWD.\r"

The authors could find no previous discussion of either of these processes in the orthopedic literature. Acute arthritis in a patient with sickle-cell disease can be a complex diagnostic and therapeutic problem.\r"

  ".W": "The bone healing process normally unites fractures, arthrodeses, osteotomies, and bone grafting operations. The process normally proceeds in successive stages named the fracture, granulation, and modeling/remodeling stages. A separate regional acceleratory phenomenon speeds up each of the other stages. The osteoclast and osteoblast cells that make intercellular substances of each stage do not exist in sufficient numbers to heal the bone at the moment of fracture or operation. They are made by local multicellular mediator mechanisms that contain precursor and supporting cells, capillaries, lymph, and innervation, plus local autocrine and paracrine regulation. Under the influences of local and systemic agents, these mediator mechanisms determine whether new local osteoclasts and osteoblasts will appear, in addition to when, where, how many, what kind, and for how long. Errors in those functions can then lead to several kinds of retarded or otherwise abnormal bone healing that will be discussed in Part II of this work.\r"

  ".W": "Bone healing problems can be divided into: technical failures, when treatment problems have impaired normal biologic potential; biologic failures, when biologic malfunctions have made the correct treatment ineffective; and combinations of the two. Biologic failures include inadequate callus formation or lack of a normal regional acceleratory phenomenon (RAP), normal modeling or remodeling, or maldifferentiation of the healing tissues, plus combinations. The most common biologic failures involve the inability to form callus and/or a normal RAP. When an inadequate RAP combines with inadequate callus production, then chronic infection, nonunion, multiple failed bone grafts and fixation procedures, and even amputation can ensue. Accumulating evidence suggests that most biologic failures stem from problems attributable to mitogens, differentiating and priming agents, growth factors, and other labile biochemical and biophysical messengers and signals in the region of the fracture itself. The ability of bone to heal can differ in different parts of the bony skeleton at a given moment. Until the basic causes of such problems can be corrected, present-day clinicians must manage them by presently available treatments while conducting research that might resolve them. The causes of most biologic failures probably act within the first weeks after the fracture, although it may take months for clinical roentgenograms to show their effects.\r"

The 143 (25.3% of the total sample) patients with initial abnormal results in at least one screening test (ST) were recalled for further investigations. An IEM was diagnosed in 40.6 percent of the 106 patients who came for reevaluation. In 114 of the remaining 423 patients who had normal initial ST, an IEM was still suspected on basis of clinical, radiological, and/or laboratory findings and was confirmed in 30 of such patients (5.3% of the total sample and 7.1% of the patients with normal results in the SP). The sensitivity of the SP was estimated maximally as 67.4 percent and the efficiency as 80.4 percent. Twenty-five of the 30 cases undetected with the SP were patients with sphingolipidoses. The simple inclusion of thin-layer chromatography of urinary oligosaccharides in the SP should allow the detection of at least one half of these cases, increasing its sensitivity by 14.1 percent and its efficiency by 4.6 percent. In at least 7.1 percent of patients with an initial normal ST, an IEM was detected. These would have remained undiagnosed if the limitations of the SP employed had not been fully understood.\r"

The effects of four meals of similar energy, but different nutritional, composition on postprandial blood pressure, heart rate, autonomic function, catecholamines, insulin and packed cell volume levels were studied in seven fit elderly subjects. 2. The high carbohydrate and high protein meals led to a significant overall fall in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared either with no change or a rise after the normal (i.e. mixed) and high fat meals. Similar between-meal differences were seen with erect diastolic but not erect systolic blood pressure. No significant postural blood pressure fall occurred after any of the meals. Supine heart rate was unaffected by meal type or by time, and although erect heart rate showed a small increase during the study there was no between-meal difference. 3. Parasympathetic function was unaffected by meal type. Plasma noradrenaline rose after the high carbohydrate and mixed meals only, remaining elevated for 120 min after meal consumption. This increase was not related to the changes in blood pressure or plasma insulin levels. 4. Plasma insulin and glucose rose after the high carbohydrate and mixed meals, but were unchanged after the high protein and high fat meals. Packed cell volume showed a small decrease towards the end of the study, although there was no between-meal variation. 5. The differences in the cardiovascular changes after the different meals could not be ascribed to alterations in autonomic function, insulin release or fall in plasma volume. We propose that the postprandial changes in blood pressure are due to the nutrient composition of the meal rather than the actual energy load.\r"

Superfusion with a series of low [Ca2+] buffers in either ascending or descending order of concentration increased renin release. Exposure to 0.06 mmol/l Ca2+ increased release by 120% (P less than 0.001) when presented as the first buffer in ascending order of concentration and by 79% (P less than 0.001) when presented as the fourth and last in a series of descending order. 3. The Ca2+ entry blocking drug diltiazem in a range of concentrations increased renin release and at 10(-5) mol/l diltiazem the mean stimulation was 35% (P less than 0.01). 4. 8-(N.N-Diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8) reduces the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and, studied over a range of concentrations, this compound increased renin release. At 10(-5) mol/l TMB-8 the mean increase was 44% (P less than 0.001). 5. None of these experimental manipulations, low [Ca2+], diltiazem or TMB-8, had any effect on the release of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate into the cell superfusate, indicating that a decrease in intracellular [Ca2+] increases renin release by a mechanism which is independent of changes in adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate production. 6. Effects of low [Ca2+], diltiazem and TMB-8 on renin secretion were all shown to be reversible when superfusion with control buffer was resumed.\r"

  ".W": "1. The 'flooding dose' technique for measuring the rate of protein synthesis in tissues in vivo involves the injection of a large amount of unlabelled amino acid together with the tracer to minimize differences in isotopic enrichment of the free amino acid in plasma and tissue compartments. This approach has been investigated in human muscle by taking biopsies from postabsorptive male volunteers given [1-13C]leucine. 2. Intravenous injection of 4 g of unlabelled leucine resulted in a rapid rise in free leucine concentration of seven- to eleven-fold in plasma and five-fold in muscle. Values were still elevated by two-fold after 2 h. 3. Five minutes after injection of [1-13C]leucine (0.05 g/kg) the isotopic enrichment of plasma leucine was 82% that of the injected material, falling to 44% at 120 min. The enrichment of free leucine in sequential muscle biopsies was close to that in plasma and almost identical to that for plasma alpha-ketoisocaproate. 4. The rate of protein synthesis was determined from the increase in leucine enrichment in protein of muscle biopsies taken before and 90 min after injection of [1-13C]leucine (0.05 g/kg; 19 or 39 atom% excess) and the average plasma alpha-ketoisocaproate enrichment over this period (taken to represent muscle free leucine). The mean rate of muscle protein synthesis in 10 subjects was 1.95 (SEM 0.12) %/day. Rates of protein synthesis calculated from plasma leucine as precursor enrichment were only 5% lower than those calculated from plasma alpha-ketoisocaproate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Residual endogenous insulin secretion can be assessed by the circulating C-peptide concentration and is present in up to 15% of subjects with established insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Its role in lipid metabolism in IDDM is not clearly defined. We examined the relationships between serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and the response of circulating C-peptide to a test meal in 205 subjects with IDDM. 2. Lipid and lipoprotein levels and glycaemic control did not differ significantly between patients with undetectable, low or high C-peptide responses. 3. High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and its subfractions were inversely related to concentrations of serum triacylglycerols (P less than 0.01-0.001), but not to C-peptide or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1) levels. Levels of HbA1 and triacylglycerols were correlated with one another (P less than 0.01). Analysis of variance revealed that differences in gender and triacylglycerol concentrations were the most important determinants of HDL and HDL2 cholesterol levels. C-peptide only exerted a weak effect on HDL2 cholesterol levels and no significant predictors of HDL3 cholesterol were found. 4. It is concluded that endogenous insulin secretion (assessed by C-peptide concentration) is relatively unimportant in modifying HDL metabolism in IDDM and that associated clinical features, in particular ambient hypertriglyceridaemia, are of greater importance.\r"

ANGs were determined using a system of extraction by Sep-Pak cartridges followed by h.p.l.c. combined with radioimmunoassay. 2. Sodium depletion resulted in increases of ANG II in the cerebrospinal fluid from 1.16 +/- 0.38 (SEM) to 1.83 +/- 0.43 fmol/ml (P less than 0.01) and of ANG III from 0.65 +/- 0.11 to 0.86 +/- 0.15 fmol/ml (P less than 0.01). 3. The ANG II level in the cerebrospinal fluid was found to be unchanged and recovery of added ANG II was approximately 90%, even after incubation for 3 h, on both diets. Thus, it is unlikely that ANG II is produced or degraded in the cerebrospinal fluid in vitro. 4. There was no significant correlation between the cerebrospinal fluid and the plasma ANG II concentration on the low sodium diet. 5. These results suggest that the cerebrospinal fluid ANG II level increases with sodium depletion, and that the effect of the level of ANG II on the activity of the angiotensin-forming system in the central nervous system may be assessed by determination of ANG II in the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Juvenile arthritis includes a variety of rheumatic disorders with varied articular and extraarticular manifestations. The heterogeneity of JA cannot be overemphasized in a rational approach to therapy. Fortunately, most children with JA improve significantly with first-line treatment, especially those with pauciarticular disease. Only a small number of these patients go on to require second-line treatment, usually because of the evolution of their condition into the polyarticular type. Patients with polyarticular, RF-positive disease and patients with early-onset polyarthritis in association with systemic-onset disease both have poor prognoses in terms of ultimate joint function, and should receive second-line treatment early in their therapy. Injectable gold is the drug of choice for the former patients, if an initial trial of NSAIDs has failed. Patients with polyarticular onset, RF-negative disease generally have a better prognosis than other patients with polyarticular involvement. One may wait considerably longer before introducing a second-line agent for these patients. An antimalarial agent may be a reasonable choice for these patients, especially those with limited polyarticular involvement (5 to 10 active joints). This latter principle may also be applied to patients who evolve from pauciarticular to polyarticular involvement. In all such cases, penicillamine is almost never used as first choice. If the patient is a young child, the difficulty with injecting gold and the hazards of antimalarial agents may limit the use of these treatments. In situations such as this, auranofin or sulfasalazine may be the drug of choice. Cytotoxic/antimetabolic therapy should be reserved for those children who have continued active disease despite full courses of two SAARDs, or for those who have been unable to take SAARDs because of their side effects. Corticosteroid therapy should be used only when specifically indicated, and every attempt should be made to wean the patient from it as soon as feasible. The aim of therapy is to ensure that patients enter their remission in the best condition possible. For this to be assured, a sensible approach to drug therapy is mandatory.\r"

  ".W": "The supply of donor organs remains extremely limited, and improved methods of maintaining the lungs of potential donors to allow for transplantation must be developed. Currently the upper limit of donor lung ischemic even with our \"best\" preservation techniques is approximately 4 to 6 hours. Improved methods for preservation will increase the supply of suitable lungs and will considerably simplify the logistics of transplantation just as has occurred with liver transplantation. Efficient use of donor organs remains of paramount importance. We recently performed two single-lung transplants utilizing lungs from one donor. Likewise, there is no reason why a lung could not be sent to another center for transplantation if the harvesting group uses only one lung. Sufficient progress has been achieved to date to warrant continued application of lung transplantation for end-stage pulmonary disease. With increasing experience, one can anticipate refinement of techniques and broader application of these procedures. Single lung transplantation, initially restricted to patients with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis, has now been successfully applied to patients with emphysema, pulmonary hypertension, and other conditions. Although transplantation currently can offer real benefit only to a limited number of persons, it serves to create hope for many others. An additional benefit may prove to be the interest and attention that transplantation focuses on patients with end-stage lung disease and on the pathophysiology of chronic respiratory failure. Knowledge gained may ultimately result in the prevention of many of the disorders for which lung transplantation currently offers the only hope.\r"

  ".W": "Preservation of anorectal function makes chemoradiotherapy attractive as the primary treatment in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal region. Despite variations in techniques of chemoradiotherapy administration, the accumulated experience of a number of institutions indicates substantial improvement over previous approaches, which included surgery or radiation therapy individually. Although no longer providing the definitive therapeutic role in this disease, the surgeon is frequently asked to evaluate lesions suspected of being anal malignancies. In addition, it is the surgeon who most often performs the diagnostic biopsy, consults on local complications of chemoradiotherapy, and manages complications of local recurrence. In this context, optimal care includes early organization of the medical oncologist, radiation therapist, and surgeon to participate in the initial diagnostic evaluations, examinations with the patient under anesthesia, and follow-up during therapy. A complete response is often not evident until 2 to 3 months after treatment. We recommend a follow-up schedule of monthly visits for the first 6 months, examinations every 3 months for the next 2 years, and assessment every 6 months thereafter. Evaluation during early routine visits includes manual and proctoscopic examination of the perineum and rectum and review of the hemogram and liver enzyme levels in the serum. CT, MRI, or lower endoscopy procedures are performed only if clinical examination or studies suggest the possibility of recurrence or a second primary tumor. Patients with an incomplete response to therapy after 3 months often undergo examination under anesthesia with biopsy of suspect areas. Chronic inflammatory changes in the area of previous carcinoma may be interpreted as persistent disease. Thus histologic proof of recurrent malignancy must be obtained before considering surgical or chemoradiotherapy salvage treatment.\r"

It is also well recognized that bronchial hyperresponsiveness is increased following allergen exposure, although no particular mediator has been shown to induce this response. The recent observation that PAF can induce increased nonspecific bronchial reactivity in normal subjects emphasizes its importance as an inflammatory mediator. In this report we sought to further elucidate the role of PAF in airway hyperreactivity by comparing the effect of PAF on methacholine-induced airway responsiveness in six non-asthmatic subjects. Nonspecific airway responsiveness was not significantly increased following PAF inhalation at 6 hours nor was it increased at 1, 2, 7, or 14 days. Further elucidation of the potential role of PAF in explaining changes in airway reactivity is necessary.\r"

The magnitude of the fall in PaCO2 was about the same as that obtained with dose of 50 mg per day in our previous study. The results indicate that the dosages of progestin and the effect of the drug on ventilation were not in parallel, and it may provide the idea that larger doses of progestin would not necessarily be required to stimulate ventilation.\r"

The Q?? was measured during total cardiopulmonary bypass as the volume of blood accumulating in the left heart. This blood was vented by gravity from the left heart via a cannula introduced in the right upper pulmonary vein and advanced to the lowest portion of the left heart. In group A (n = 10) the Qbr(s-p) was measured for 25 to 95 min with constant PA (4.0 +/- 0.2 cm H2O, mean +/- SE). In group B (n = 10) Qbr(s-p) was measured for 20 min with PA = 4.1 +/- 0.2 cm H2O and for a further 20 min with PA = 14.1 +/- 0.4 cm H2O. The Qbr(s-p) ranged between 0.32 and 2.76 percent of cardiac output (pump flow) and remained constant with time (group A). The increase of PA from 4.1 +/- 0.2 to 14.1 +/- 0.4 cm H2O reduced Qbr(s-p) by approximately 40 percent (p less than 0.01, group B). We conclude that positive PA reduces Qbr(s-p) during total cardiopulmonary bypass. Therefore, we advise using low PA during assisted ventilation to preserve bronchial blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "The potential for significant interaction between PEEP and the peripheral microcirculations is not as well appreciated as are its central circulatory effects. Therefore, we studied the effects of PEEP, 15 mm Hg, on microvascular fluid flux in the hindlimb of ten mature sheep. Changes in prefemoral lymph flow (QL) and in lymph to plasma [L/P] total protein (TP) ratios were measured following the application of PEEP for 2 h, before and during hyperdynamic sepsis. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP). Although the onset of sepsis was not associated with an increase in prefemoral QL, the [L/P] ratio of iodinated 125I human serum albumin (125I-HSA) was significantly greater 72 h after CLP than during the nonseptic baseline study. Histologic examination of gastrocnemius muscle also demonstrated an increase in protein-rich interstitial edema during the septic studies. During the 2 h of PEEP, prefemoral QL increased equally (p less than 0.05) in three study periods: (1) baseline nonseptic, delta QL = +1.2 +/- 1.4 ml/h; (2) septic period 1, 24 to 48 h after CLP, delta QL = +1.3 +/- 1.2 ml/h; and, (3) septic period 2, 72 h after CLP, delta QL = 1.0 +/- 0.6 ml/h. Calculated microvascular hydrostatic pressures also rose significantly during PEEP therapy in all three study periods. We conclude that PEEP, 15 mm Hg, increased hindlimb microvascular fluid flux and may thereby increase interstitial fluid content in tissues drained by the prefemoral lymph node. These effects of PEEP were not aggravated by hyperdynamic sepsis, despite a presumed increase in systemic microvascular permeability at this time.\r"

Less frequently, anemia may result from red cell aplasia, folate or B12 deficiency, hemolytic processes, or hypersplenism. Occasional patients may become polycythemic because of erythropoietin-producing tumors such as renal adenocarcinomas or cerebellar hemangiomas. Elevation of the white cell count is commonly seen, especially in patients with lung cancer. Monocytosis and thrombocytosis, which may be early signs of an underlying malignancy, are also very common and occur in up to half of patients. Thrombocytopenia is commonly a result of therapy or marrow replacement; a few patients may have a syndrome resembling immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Abnormalities of coagulation are present in many patients, and may lead to superficial or deep venous thromboses, pulmonary emboli, nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis with arterial emboli, bleeding, or acute disseminated intravascular coagulation. A sound understanding of the potential hematologic complications that can result from the malignant process is essential to the clinician caring for cancer patients.\r"

The intracellular concentration of ionized calcium is the major regulator of cellular function. Patients may present with signs and symptoms of deranged calcium homeostasis that range from the mild and nonspecific to the truly life threatening. Critically ill patients may develop profound, life-threatening hypocalcemia either as a result of their underlying illness or as a complication of resuscitation. Patients with hypercalcemia may present with symptoms that are so vague and nonspecific that the diagnosis may not be considered. An understanding of the pathophysiology of calcium metabolism allows the emergency physician to identify patients at risk for abnormal calcium homeostasis, and to intervene in an appropriate manner. Magnesium is an essential cofactor in a host of important biochemical reactions. Magnesium deficiency is fairly common in certain groups of patients and can cause serious complications. The diagnosis is often difficult to make in the Emergency Department setting. The emergency physician should be aware of clinical situations that predispose to magnesium deficiency and be prepared to institute empiric therapy if indicated. Severe hypermagnesemia is rather uncommonly encountered in the Emergency Department. The magnesium ion is an effective calcium channel blocker, and patients with severe hypermagnesemia develop profound cardiovascular and neuromuscular dysfunction as a result. In pharmacologic doses, magnesium's unique calcium channel antagonism may be clinically useful, and there is growing interest in its potential use as an antiarrhythmic, anticonvulsant, and smooth muscle relaxant.\r"

The excess thyroid hormone is released from the thyroid gland as a result of excess thyroid hormone production, or by processes that disrupt the follicular structure of the gland with subsequent release of stored hormone. True hyperthyroidism results from increased synthesis and release of thyroid hormone and can be distinguished from other causes of thyrotoxicosis by the thyroid 131I uptake. Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism and occurs most often in women aged 30 to 50 years. The classic features of a patient with fully developed Graves' disease are difficult to overlook, but the clinical features of thyrotoxicosis vary with the etiology of the disease and the sensitivity of the patient's peripheral tissues. Thyroid storm presents with an exaggeration of the features of uncomplicated thyrotoxicosis and, in addition, an alteration in mental status. Thyroid storm may lead to irreversible cardiovascular collapse and death if proper treatment is not initiated in the Emergency Department. Specific therapy of hyperthyroidism follows several strategies, including inhibition of hormone synthesis and release, inhibition of peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, and blocking of the systemic effects of excess thyroid hormone. Treatments directed at these ends may be initiated rapidly in the emergency setting.\r"

Laboratory evaluations of thyroid function are not usually performed on a 24-hour basis, and therefore the emergency physician, although suspecting the presence of hypothyroidism, may be unable to confirm the diagnosis while the patient is in the Emergency Department. It is not always the responsibility of the emergency physician to diagnose hypothyroidism, but in some clinical settings it may be important to include thyroid function tests in laboratory evaluation of patients to ensure adequate patient care and followup. Careful attention to nonspecific complaints, myxedematous changes, and signs of dysfunction of any organ system, especially in older female patients, may lead to the ultimate correct diagnosis. Myxedema coma is potentially fatal and must be recognized and treated emergently, usually prior to laboratory confirmation. Ventilatory support and thyroid hormone replacement are the two most important therapeutic maneuvers in the treatment of myxedema coma.\r"

  ".W": "Although loss of normal pituitary function may be silent and asymptomatic, sudden loss of gland function (pituitary apoplexy) typically results in characteristic presentations. Sheehan's syndrome is the development of hypopituitarism after postpartum hemorrhage or shock. Patients with Sheehan's syndrome may have typical or atypical presentations based on the extent of pituitary gland destruction. Patients with typical symptoms fail to lactate after giving birth; subsequently these patients also develop symptoms and signs of hypopituitarism. Measuring the serum prolactin level after giving thyrotropin-releasing hormone is a reasonable first step in the diagnosis of this condition in patients who fail to lactate after giving birth. The diagnosis of hypopituitarism is delayed for up to 7 years in patients with atypical symptoms. Acute symptomatic failure of the pituitary gland (pituitary apoplexy) commonly occurs in patients who have asymptomatic pituitary tumors. Many patients with pituitary tumors do not have signs of abnormal endocrine gland secretion and have a normal appearance. Most patients have the following signs or symptoms: headache; acute disturbances in visual acuity or visual fields; ophthalmoplegia, and changes in the level of consciousness. The syndrome of pituitary apoplexy usually evolves over hours to days. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and acute bacterial meningitis are the two most important mimics of pituitary apoplexy. Intravenous steroids and prompt neurosurgical consultation are mandatory in cases of pituitary apoplexy since both steroids and surgery can improve vision. Testings for acute or chronic hypopituitarism is challenging in the Emergency Department setting; however, carefully chosen tests will aid in the subsequent early correct diagnosis after initial Emergency Department management.\r"

Ethanol can interact with normal metabolic pathways to produce a variety of life-threatening abnormalities, particularly in those with underlying poor nutritional status, as is found in many alcohol users. Once identified, the metabolic derangements associated with alcohol use generally respond well to therapeutic interventions. The recurrence rate, however, is extremely high. Any attempt at long-term solutions must involve extensive rehabilitative services. Current research is directed largely toward improving survival from alcohol-related illnesses such as cirrhosis and cardiac disease. We must focus our efforts on the social implications of alcoholism, providing medical support, counseling, and rehabilitation to affected persons. Since alcohol-related problems present most frequently to the Emergency Department, it is appropriate that the emergency physician take the first step in attacking this disease, a step that may be as simple as a referral for detoxification or social services support.\r"

After GnRH-a, gonadotropin and ovarian steroid hormone levels were similar to those of the hypogonadotropic patients. Subsequent secretory responses to GnRH pulses were partially normalized. However, only two additional PCOD patients ovulated.\r"

The follicular development in terms of numbers of small (less than 8 mm), intermediate (9 to 15 mm), and large (greater than 15 mm) follicles and their distribution in either one or both ovaries on the day of assumed ovulation was related to the dosage of CC. A statistically significant increase was found in the total number of follicles in relation to the dosage of CC (P less than 0.003). In view of the development of the mature follicles, the gradual increase in CC daily dosage was thought to be associated with additional mature follicles before ovulation. However, this increased follicular recruitment was not regarded as statistically significant. Treatment with low doses of CC resulted in follicular development in only one ovary, whereas increased follicular recruitment after high CC dosage was found in association with follicular development in both ovaries.\r"

After attainment of ovarian suppression, seven such women received physiological steroidal replacement regimens with cryopreserved-thawed ETs prospectively synchronized with the 4th day of progesterone administration and two conceived. These GEEP cycles and cryopreserved-thawed ETs were prospectively compared with cryopreserved-thawed ETs performed on the 4th day of exposure to progesterone in 20 spontaneous cycles and in 5 oocyte donation-steroidal replacement cycles. Pregnancies occurred after three cryopreserved-thawed ETs in each of these groups. We conclude that GEEP constitutes a successful preparation for cryopreserved-thawed ETs, at the least, in women with ovulatory dysfunction.\r"

When compared with reference data available for the immunobead test (IBT), the direct protocol (semen) for SpermCheck yielded 94.4% sensitivity with 100% specificity; the indirect protocol (serum) provided a sensitivity of 100% with 94.7% specificity. The microspheres of SpermCheck maintain a nearly uniform concentration per volume, with none to negligible clumping. The greater difference between the optical densities of latex and cytoplasm allows use of a light microscope for the rapid assessment of the percent of regional binding rather than the phase-contrast microscope required for the IBT. SpermCheck eliminates many difficulties encountered with the IBT, making SpermCheck a convenient screening assay for use in the physician's office.\r"

This resulted partially from differences between the two technicians in propensity to dilute concentrated specimens.

Differences in motion-related parameters could not be ascribed to technicians, but the basis for these differences is also unknown. The results suggest that values obtained from the CellSoft image analysis system may not be comparable between technicians or laboratories, despite use of identical computer parameter settings.

  ".U": "90033432\r", 
  ".W": "Excess body fat has been clearly associated with an increased risk of oligo-ovulation and endometrial/breast carcinoma. The connection has been assumed to lie within derangements of the metabolic/endocrine compartments, particularly of estrogens and androgens. To differentiate the effect of obesity from its related disease process, an attempt has been made to define the reproductive-endocrinologic alterations encountered in otherwise asymptomatic obese women. Androgen metabolism is accelerated in obesity. It is not clear whether the increased clearance precedes or follows the accelerated production of androgens. A servocontrol mechanism appears to be operative in these asymptomatic individuals, maintaining plasma steroid levels normal. The unbound fraction of T may be somewhat increased in overweight women with predominantly upper body fat deposition. The increased clearance of androgen may arise from an obesity-related depression in SHBG concentration (e.g., for T, E2, delta 5-diol, etc.). Adipose tissue, by virtue of the lipid solubility of most of these steroids, concentrates androgens, estrogens, and progesterone. This steroid sequestration not only contributes to the obesity-related increase in androgen clearance but also leads to an extremely enlarged total body steroid pool. Fat tissue sequestration also increases the concentration of androgens in the vicinity of adipose stromal cells, possibly encouraging their aromatization. Adipose tissue also has a moderate degree of 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, which appears to stimulate the conversion of A to T. Finally, alterations in peripheral and hepatic conjugation and an accelerated urinary excretion may contribute to the elevated clearance of androgens. The accelerated PR of androgens may simply result as compensation for the elevated MCR in obesity. Nonetheless, evidence of alteration(s) in adrenocortical steroidogenesis has been presented suggesting a selective obesity-related enhancement in adrenal androgen secretion. These remain to be confirmed. Nonetheless, adrenocortical abnormalities may arise secondary to the influence of other circulating and intra-adrenal factors, including insulin, prolactin, estrogens, and androgens. It is not known whether the accelerated androgen metabolism or the aberrant adrenal steroidogenesis improve with weight reduction. Excess body fat increases androgen aromatization which, together with an obesity-related decrease in SHBG, is associated with mildly elevated levels of E1 and free E2 in postmenopausal women. Although premenopausal obese individuals have the same tendency, the far greater ovarian estrogen secretion overshadows any differences. The bulk of aromatization activity in fat lies in the stromal comportment. The major substrate for peripheral estrogen production is A. Testosterone also contributes to the estrogen pool via its conversion to E2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Even though it was inferior to the 24-hour HSG with respect to identifying pelvic adhesions, it may serve as an adequate substitute to the above since the sensitivity of the HSG in identifying adhesions is low and has little influence on the clinical decision process in the evaluation of infertility.\r"

DMSO was added to the eggs at either room temperature or at 0 degrees C. Maximum success rate (42% of frozen eggs developing to two cells) was obtained when DMSO was added at 0 degrees C and the eggs slow cooled to -80 degrees C. Removal of cumulus failed to improve freezing success rates. Addition of DMSO at temperatures above 0 degrees C significantly reduced the fertilizing capacity of eggs. Excessive exposure of eggs to temperatures around 15 degrees C also caused a significant reduction in fertilization rates. The effects of DMSO and cooling on fertilization are likely to be due to zona hardening by cortical granule release and to disorganization of the egg cytoskeleton and plasma membrane. These problems will be difficult to overcome if cryopreservation of the unfertilized human egg is preferred to the fertilized egg or early cleavage stage embryo in clinical in vitro fertilization.\r"

Penetration results were, in general, significantly worse when patients spermatozoa were used as compared with donor spermatozoa. When inseminated with donor spermatozoa, oocytes from cases of male infertility gave better penetration results as compared with those from cases of idiopathic infertility with no apparent sperm defect. No differences in penetration results were found between oocytes aged 1 day and 2 days in culture before zona removal and reinsemination, even though less pronuclei reached full functional maturity in the more aged group of eggs. These results indicate that human zona-free eggs prepared from oocytes after unsuccessful IVF attempts may be used to assess the fertilizing ability of human spermatozoa. Moreover, when used with donor spermatozoa, this system may help to determine the contribution of the oocyte to fertilization failure.\r"

The resistance index was used to evaluate the blood pattern. When comparing the patients who became pregnant after embryo transfer (ET [group I, n = 12]) with those who did not conceive (group II, n = 33), it is evident that in group I the vascular resistance of the uterine arteries is significantly lower on the day of follicular aspiration. No differences could be detected in the ovarian vessels. The data obtained so far suggest that the receptivity of the endometrium is a crucial factor for successful implantation. In the final analysis, this can be appraised not only on the basis of morphological but also of hemodynamic parameters.\r"

Patient sperm failing to penetrate oocytes had fewer acrosome reactions than did healthy males, but the percentage reacted was not correlated with oocyte penetration. Sperm incubated 3 hours, then exposed to hFF, exhibited increased penetrations for 7 of 10 males, without an increase in percentage reacted sperm. Sperm incubated 22 hours before hFF treatment had penetrating ability enhanced 250- to 1000-fold, but the percentage reacted increased only sixfold. We conclude that factors other than the percentage reacted sperm are the major determinants of penetration capacity.\r"

Sperm were caught in the trap and manipulated by a joy stick controlled motorized stage. After different exposure periods, the velocity and patterns were analysed by a computerized image processor. There were minor changes in sperm velocity when exposed to the trap for 30 seconds or less. A gradual decrease in the mean linear velocity was observed after 45 seconds of exposure.

Theoretical and clinical data refute the theory that ISH is merely a marker for medial arteriosclerosis. Although no prospective data regarding the benefit of treating ISH are yet available, the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, currently under way, should be able to provide clinicians with guidelines for treating this condition.\r"

The four drug classes recommended by JNC IV for the treatment of high blood pressure are quite similar in effectiveness. Low-dose diuretics, however, particularly when combined with a potassium-sparing agent, produce significantly fewer adverse reactions than seen with the other classes of drugs. This advantage, coupled with their low cost, makes diuretics the reasonable first choice for the treatment of older hypertensives.\r"

In a double blind multicentre trial, 151 patients were randomly assigned to either omeprazole or ranitidine. Clinical assessments and endoscopies were carried out at two and four weeks. Patients characteristics were similar in both groups. Statistical analysis (chi 2 test) did not show any significant difference in healing rate (p greater than 0.20) irrespective of the method of calculation. On an 'intent-to-treat' analysis (n = 151), healing was: omeprazole 46.6%, ranitidine 43.3% at day 15 and omeprazole 70.7%, ranitidine 68.4% at day 29; and among the patients who completed treatment, healing was: omeprazole 48.3%, ranitidine 46.3% at day 15 (n = 125; 95% confidence interval of the difference--17 to 21) and omeprazole 79.6%, ranitidine 75.4% at day 29 (n = 115; 95% confidence interval of the difference--13 to 21). After a further four weeks treatment with omeprazole, healing occurred in 16/20 (80%) who still had active disease at day 29. Patients on omeprazole and on ranitidine experienced similar decrease in day time and night time epigastric pain and in heartburn. Multivariate analysis (logistic regression) did not indicate any influence on age, sex, smoking and alcohol habits, previous drug administered, duodenitis and duodenal erosions on the healing rate. In this model, healing rate was not significantly influenced by previous treatment duration (p = 0.09 at day 15 and p greater than 0.2 at day 29) but was significantly influenced by ulcer size (p = 0.04 at day 15 and p = 0.02 at day 29).

Lower oesophageal sphincter pressure, oesophageal body motility and oesophageal pH were monitored for 30 minutes before and three hours after the meal. Plasma cisapride concentrations were measured before and after dosing on both study days. With cisapride treatment, the plasma cisapride levels ranged from 48.1 (5.0) to 75.9 (6.9) ng/ml. Plasma levels were undetectable during placebo treatment. Cisapride enhanced acid clearance but had no significant effect on the duration of acid exposure, the rate of reflux episodes, the pattern of lower oesophageal sphincter pressure associated with the reflux episodes, basal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure or oesophageal peristalsis.

Subjective complaints were improved in both treatment groups except for nausea and meteorism that improved more in the CBS treated patients.

The model was applied to a data base of patients from the New England Medical Center Hospitals (n = 141) and the Scott and White Clinic (n = 35) and found to predict their survival accurately. It was also shown to be accurate for Mayo primary biliary cirrhosis patients with very advanced disease (n = 30), those with less than a 33% chance of surviving 12 months. The analyses confirmed that the addition of histologic stage did not significantly improve the predictive power of the model (p greater than 0.10). We suggest that the Mayo model is a practical tool for clinical management and decision making.\r"

Subjects were six patients with unilateral renovascular hypertension and six with essential hypertension. In patients with renovascular hypertension, prostaglandin E2 concentration in renal venous plasma from the stenotic kidney was 9.25 +/- 1.48 pg/ml, which was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than the concentration in the renal venous plasma from the normal kidney (4.97 +/- 1.02 pg/ml) or in the aortic plasma (2.59 +/- 0.15 pg/ml). Plasma renin activity was also higher in the renal vein of the stenotic kidney than in the other two sites. The stenotic side/normal side ratio of the renal venous prostaglandin E2 correlated significantly with a renin ratio greater than 1.5 (r = 0.8211, p less than 0.05). Intravenous injection of aspirin DL-lysine (18 mg/kg) 30 minutes later markedly suppressed prostaglandin E2 and renin levels at all sites and clearly lowered arterial blood pressure (mean: from 120 +/- 6 to 110 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). The reduction in blood pressure correlated significantly with the suppression of plasma renin activity in the aorta (p less than 0.05) and in the renal vein of the stenotic kidney (p less than 0.01). Conversely, in patients with essential hypertension, aspirin had little effect on renin levels and increased mean blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The factors studied included use of oral contraceptive agents or markers of sex hormone dysfunction, mechanical stress to the renal artery wall, human lymphocytic antigen (HLA) type, cigarette smoking, history of hypertension for more than 5 years, and family history of cardiovascular disease. The risk of fibromuscular dysplasia was significantly (p = 0.003) increased (odds ratio = 4.1, 95% confidence interval = 1.5-10.9) among cigarette smokers. A significant (p less than 0.001) dose-response relation was noted between cigarette use and the risk of fibromuscular dysplasia developing (odds ratio = 8.6 for those who had smoked more than 10 pack-years). Personal history of hypertension more than 5 years was also associated (odds ratio = 5.0, 95% confidence interval = 1.1-22.8) with a significantly (p = 0.036) increased risk for the development of fibromuscular dysplasia. HLA-DRw6 antigen was more common in the 33 fibromuscular dysplasia patients than in the 61 renal transplant donor control subjects (odds ratio = 3.00, p = 0.067) or a second group of 934 ambulatory control subjects (odds ratio = 2.51, p = 0.031). Adjustment for cigarette smoking increased the odds ratio to 5.0 (95% confidence interval = 1.3-19.6).

At all doses greater than 0.1 microgram/kg/min, there was a parallel decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP), plasma renin activity, and plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) concentration. On the other hand, assays with monoclonal antibodies specific for total renin and active renin demonstrated that the peptide's inhibition of circulating active renin stimulated the release of both. The maximal effective R-Pep-27 dose was approximately 16 micrograms/kg/min, which reduced MAP by an average of 15.8 +/- 1.4 mm Hg (n = 14) and plasma renin activity and plasma Ang II concentration to 3% (n = 9) and 15% (n = 5), respectively, of the pretreatment values. At 0.1 microgram/kg/min, there was no significant decrease in MAP; however, measurement of plasma renin activity showed an average decrease in activity of 42% (n = 3). No significant change in the heart rate was observed at all the doses studied. For comparison, intravenous captopril (400 micrograms/kg bolus) was administered after the MAP of the monkeys had recovered from the peptide experiments, and it reduced MAP by 25.1 +/- 2.4 mm Hg (n = 10) without significantly changing plasma renin activity. As anticipated, injection of angiotensin I (80-160 ng/kg bolus) into sodium-depleted monkeys during peptide infusion caused a transient rise in MAP of 14.8 +/- 5.4 mm Hg (n = 4) above the mean pretreatment value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After 6 weeks of hypertension, seven rats were treated with captopril (2 mg/kg daily) for 4 weeks, six were left hypertensive for another 4 weeks, and the remaining rats were killed under ether anesthesia. In the latter, ventricular mass was significantly higher than in controls; V3 isomyosin was 32.3 +/- 6.8% versus 0%, and both creatine kinase-MB and -BB were increased at the expense of creatine kinase-MM (creatine kinase-MB = 29 +/- 2.8% vs. 14.7 +/- 1.8%, p less than 0.001; creatine kinase-BB = 3.1 +/- 0.6% vs. 1.7 +/- 0.8%, p less than 0.001).

In a randomized double-blind, crossover trial, 45 healthy volunteers (23 women and 22 men, 25-45 years old) with a habitual intake of 4-6 cups coffee/day received 5 cups of regular coffee each day for a period of 6 weeks, and 5 cups of decaffeinated coffee for the next 6 weeks or vice versa. The background diet was kept constant. The total amount of caffeine ingested was 40 mg during the decaffeinated coffee period and 445 mg during the regular coffee period. Use of decaffeinated coffee led to a significant but small decrease in systolic (mean +/- SEM, -1.5 +/- 0.4 mm Hg; p = 0.002) and diastolic (-1.0 +/- 0.4 mm Hg; p = 0.017) ambulant blood pressure and to a small increase in ambulant heart rate (+1.3 +/- 0.6 beats/min; p = 0.031). Individual differences in rate of caffeine metabolism did not explain differences in long-term response of blood pressure to caffeine. We conclude that in normotensive adults replacement of regular by decaffeinated coffee leads to a real but small fall in blood pressure. However, it remains to be established whether a mass switch from regular to decaffeinated coffee would significantly reduce the total incidence of hypertension-related disorders.\r"

In a second study, acid-base status using various amounts of L-lactate exclusively was studied. The third study compared symptoms and acid-base changes during 9 weeks of high-efficiency dialysis when using L-lactate, acetate, or bicarbonate as base. In the first study, plasma bicarbonate changes were equivalent with 40 mM L-lactate and 40 mM DL-lactate, but overall correction of acidosis appeared to be suboptimal. In the second study, when compared to a bicarbonate control period, correction of acidosis was reduced when using 40 mM L-lactate + 4 mM acetate solution, but increased when using a 46 mM L-lactate + 4 mM acetate solution. In the third study, correction of acidosis was comparable when using 42 mM L-lactate + 4 mM acetate, 39 mM acetate, or 35 mM HCO3 + 4 mM acetate. Whereas 46% +/- 12 (SEM) treatments \"failed\" because of symptoms when using acetate, the percentages of \"failed\" treatments were only 7% +/- 4.2 with L-lactate (p less than 0.05) and 11% +/- 4.2 with bicarbonate (p less than 0.05). The results suggest that L-lactate is a suitable dialysis solution base that is capable of correcting chronic uremic acidosis. During high-efficiency dialysis, the incidence of intradialytic symptoms with L-lactate is comparable to that with bicarbonate and less than that with acetate.\r"

Multivariate analysis revealed that effusion size was by far the most important factor predicting need for surgery. Since early pericardial drainage obviates the risk of sudden tamponade, we recommend that surgery without prior intensive dialysis therapy be considered in such patients.\r"

Using an original biopsy technique, we were able to cultivate and characterize from the structural and caryological point of view, human and rabbit peritoneal mesothelial cells. Staphylococcal peritonitis was provoked in 12 rabbits with in-dwelling peritoneal catheters and after 4 days of antibiotic therapy, 6 of them were autoimplanted with cultured mesothelial cells. In the animals sacrificed on the third and sixth days, direct morphological observation and autoradiographic techniques showed that the transplanted cells had taken and revealed a different picture from that in the non-transplanted rabbits. In a 56 year old female diabetic patient, upon insertion of the first peritoneal catheter, a specimen of mesothelial cells was cultured and then frozen. Seven months later after an episode of peritonitis from candida which dictated removal of the peritoneal catheter, since there was a sufficient number of cultured mesothelial cells and the patient consented, the implant was performed. Peritoneal biopsy by laparoscopy three and six days later showed that the cells had taken. The purpose of the study was merely to show that autoimplant of mesothelium in man and animals is possible.\r"

To define the mechanisms responsible for the reduction in LAL positivity during HD, the membranes were used in two in vitro studies, the first of which showed that the LAL positivity of blood containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS), submitted to hemofiltration (HF) for 300 min, remained unchanged and the ultrafiltrate remained constantly LAL negative. These results suggest that the reduction in LAL positivity observed in HD in vivo, an expression of reduced endotoxemia, cannot be attributed either to the filtration of the LPS as such or to its fragmentation following blood-membrane interaction into theoretically less filtrable molecules or to mechanisms of LPS adsorption on the membrane. The in vivo reduction of LAL positivity is more likely due to removal of the filtrable endotoxin fragments already released in the body, like lipid A, the biologically active component of LPS, known to react to LAL. This hypothesis was borne out by the second in vitro study, where the LAL positivity of blood containing lipid A, treated by HF for 80 min, gradually decreased, and dialytic permeability to lipid A was confirmed by the appearance of LAL positivity in the ultrafiltrate.\r"

Plasma concentrations were corrected for changes in extracellular volume (ECV). We also studied adsorption in vitro by incubating the above membranes with I-125-labelled beta 2m. There were no changes in beta 2m plasma concentration after HD with CU dialyzers, but a significant decrease was observed with the other membranes tested. Filtration of beta 2m across the dialyzer was absent with CU and minimal with EVAL. However, large amounts were recovered from dialysate with the high-permeability dialyzers, AN-69 and PSP. In vitro studies showed that maximal adsorption capacity was obtained with AN-69 (13%) compared to 9% with CU, 4% with EVAL and 7% with PSP. In summary, beta 2m clearance with PSP is achieved through greater removal of this protein by mass transport across the membrane. The mechanism by which beta 2m is removed from blood during AN-69 dialysis seems to include both adsorption to and filtration by the membrane itself.\r"

In 40 patients with malignancy and effusions, median drainage was 450 ml; cytology was positive in 17 or 36 (47%), and pericardial biopsy showed cancer in 13 (43%) of 30 patients. In 11 patients with malignancy, both cytology of effusions and biopsy of the pericardium were negative. In 83 patients with benign effusions, median drainage was 400 ml. Effusions recurred in 14 of the 123 patients (11%); nine patients in the benign group and five in the malignant group. Five of these 14 underwent thoracotomy (3 to 542 days postoperatively); two underwent median sternotomy and one underwent pericardiocentesis. Two intraoperative deaths resulted from cardiac arrest. Mortality at 30 days was 25% (10/40 patients) in the malignant group and 11% (9/83 patients) in the benign group. No deaths resulted from recurrent effusions. The establishment of a subxiphoid pericardial window allows rapid and safe drainage of pericardial effusions with sampling for cytology and pericardial biopsy. It has minimal morbidity and few recurrent effusions.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of arteriovenous fistulae on in situ saphenous vein bypass hemodynamics and patency rates has been of great concern to some. It is our practice to ligate only those fistulae which conduct enough dye upon completion angiography to visualize the deep femoral venous system. We have prospectively studied 216 such bypasses using duplex ultrasound scanning to assess overall hemodynamic function over periods from 1 to 156 months postoperatively. Volumetric blood flow was measured in proximal and distal portions of the bypass choosing a region of uniform diameter with laminar flow. Mean fistula flow was derived by subtracting distal bypass flow from proximal bypass flow. Distal flow decreased significantly (p less than 0.01 paired t-test) from 68 +/- 4.6 ml/min (mean +/- SEM) at 2 months postoperatively to 51 +/- 4.8 ml/min at 12 months postoperatively. There was an overall decrease in fistula flow from 256 +/- 26.9 ml/min at 2 months to 86 +/- 22.6 ml/min at 12 months. In 14 of the 216 bypasses (6.5%), arteriovenous fistulae were ligated during the first postoperative year. This was necessitated by persistent increased fistula flow with or without edema and indication from PVR or segmental pressure of decreased resting flow or pressure. Following fistula ligation, fistula flow decreased and distal bypass flow improved. Within this select group of patients with reduced flow capacity, i.e., a proximal stenosis or small vein size, high fistula flow is poorly tolerated with a significant redistribution of flow resulting in reduced distal perfusion. However, for the majority of patients (95%), fistula flow does not deleteriously affect distal bypass flow.\r"

  ".W": "Susceptibility to hemolysis initiated by activated cobra venom factor (CoF) complexes is a characteristic that distinguishes the most complement-sensitive type III erythrocytes of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) from the intermediately sensitive type II and the normally sensitive type I cells. Recently we isolated a membrane constituent from normal erythrocytes that inhibits CoFBb-initiated hemolysis, and this protein was designated membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL). To investigate the molecular basis of the variability in complement sensitivity among PNH erythrocytes, the surface expression of MIRL and decay accelerating factor (DAF) on the three phenotypes of PNH was quantified immunochemically. Both complement regulatory proteins were markedly deficient on the erythrocytes from a patient with predominately type III cells. The erythrocytes from patients with a majority of either type II or I cells were also significantly deficient in both MIRL and DAF. While cytofluorometric analysis confirmed the quantitative deficiencies, segregation of erythrocytes into discrete subpopulations that expressed either no MIRL or normal amounts of MIRL was not observed. The results of immunoprecipitation studies were consistent with quantitative, but not qualitative abnormalities of MIRL and DAF. Selective removal of the sensitive erythrocytes indicated that approximately 20% of the normal amount of MIRL is sufficient to protect cells from CoF-initiated lysis. These studies suggest that relatively subtle quantitative differences in membrane complement regulatory proteins underlie the variability in complement sensitivity of PNH erythrocytes.\r"

MSA increased from 21 +/- 0.9 bursts/min at rest to 36.9 +/- 4.3 bursts/min 30 min after ingestion of D-glucose and from 18.9 +/- 2.9 to 26.3 +/- 3.4 bursts/min 30 min after D-xylose. The increase in MSA was already significant by 15 min. MSA had not returned to the basal level after 90 min. Neither intravenous D-glucose nor water intake enhanced MSA. MSA increased in parallel with plasma norepinephrine, and a significant correlation (r = 0.55; P less than 0.001) was observed between the plasma insulin concentration and MSA after D-glucose ingestion. In three subjects the outflow of sympathetic nerve activity to the skin was examined after oral D-glucose and no change was observed, emphasizing the differentiated nature of the sympathetic nerve response to carbohydrate. Multiple factors such as insulin alone, hemodynamic adjustment to splanchnic vasodilation, and gastrointestinal distension are probably involved in the increased muscle nerve sympathetic outflow after carbohydrate ingestion.\r"

Most animals remained healthy with no evidence of tissue damage throughout the observation period (4-30 wk) despite high circulating G-CSF levels (range 2,000-26,000,000 U/ml). A dramatic neutrophilic granulocytosis was observed in all hemopoietic tissues with neutrophilic infiltration occurring in the lung and liver. Spleen, peritoneal, and peripheral blood cellularity increased approximately three-, two-, and eightfold, respectively, but total bone marrow cell counts remained unchanged. Progenitor cell numbers granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cell (GM-CFC), granulocyte colony-forming cell (G-CFC), burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) and mixed colony-forming cells (Mix-CFC) were elevated between 10-100-fold in the spleen, peritoneal cavity, and peripheral blood, but were unaffected or slightly depressed in the marrow. No tumors developed in syngeneic recipients transplanted with bone marrow or spleen cells from such mice, confirming the nonneoplastic nature of the hyperplasia induced by chronic G-CSF stimulation. These experiments also indicated the stable integration of MPZen vectors in infected cells, as evident from the continuous expression of the inserted gene for at least 6 mo, and from the ability of infected stem cells from the primary recipients to express the gene in lethally irradiated secondary recipients.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the mechanism by which Shiga toxin alters intestinal water and electrolyte transport, ligated loops of rabbit jejunum were incubated in vivo with purified toxin and then studied in vivo by single pass perfusion and in vitro by the Ussing chamber voltage-clamp technique. Toxin exposure led to accumulation of water in the jejunal lumen, associated with decreased active basal NaCl absorption. Glucose- and alanine-stimulated Na absorption were also reduced, while toxin had no effect on either basal short-circuit current or the secretory response to theophylline. These observations suggest that Shiga toxin selectively inhibits NaCl absorption without significantly altering active anion secretion. To localize the cellular site of toxin action, populations of villus and crypt cells from rabbit jejunum were isolated and studied. Villus cells had a greater content of the glycolipid Shiga toxin receptor, Gb3, had more toxin binding sites than did crypt cells, and were much more sensitive than crypt cells to toxin-induced inhibition of protein synthesis. These experiments demonstrate that purified Shiga toxin inhibits jejunal fluid absorption without affecting active fluid secretion by a preferential effect on villus cells. The results suggest that this is due to the differential distribution of toxin receptors on villus compared to crypt cells.\r"

  ".W": "The removal of neutrophils and their histotoxic contents from the inflamed site is a prerequisite for resolution of tissue injury, and a point at which factors critical to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation may act. Engulfment of intact, senescent neutrophils by macrophages represents an important neutrophil disposal process. In this study the mechanism by which human monocyte-derived macrophages (M phi) recognized and ingested human neutrophils that had been aged in culture was studied using an in vitro phagocytic assay. Inhibition of M phi receptors for Ig Fc and the opsonic complement fragments C3b and iC3b with MAbs to M phi FcR, CR1, CR3, and CR4 had no effect on recognition, and the pattern of inhibition observed when polyanions were included in the medium at 1 mg/ml was different from that reported for the M phi receptor for protein advanced glycosylation end products (AGE), indicating a recognition mechanism different from those proposed for M phi phagocytosis of senescent erythrocytes. Furthermore, although aging neutrophils undergo programmed cell death (or apoptosis), which is directly related to recognition by M phi, the pattern of inhibition observed with monosaccharides was different from that reported to inhibit the binding of apoptotic mouse thymocytes to isologous M phi. By contrast, evidence was obtained for a novel recognition mechanism inhibitable by cationic sugars and amino acids in a charge-dependent fashion, and directly modulated by pH but not affected by inhibitors of the mannose-6-phosphate, sheep erythrocyte, mannosyl-fucosyl, asialoglycoprotein, and scavenger receptors of the macrophage. These observations suggest that hydrogen ions and charged molecules may modulate M phi uptake of senescent neutrophils at inflamed sites, and that recognition itself may involve charged structures on the cells.\r"

To investigate the cellular sources and the secretory control of these nasal proteins in vivo, 34 adult subjects underwent nasal provocation tests with methacholine (MC), histamine (H), and gustatory stimuli. Nasal lavages were collected and analyzed for total protein (TP), albumin (Alb), Lf, and Ly. MC (25 mg), H (1 mg), and gustatory stimuli (spicy foods) all increased the concentrations of TP, Alb, Lf, and Ly. However, when each protein was assessed as a percentage of TP (i.e., Alb% = Alb/TP; Lf% = Lf/TP; Ly% = Ly/TP), MC and gustatory stimuli, which both induce glandular secretion, selectively augmented Lf% and Ly% without changing Alb%, while H, which primarily increases vascular permeability, increased Alb% without significantly affecting Lf% or Ly%. Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting analysis of nasal secretions demonstrated both Lf and Ly in cholinergically induced secretions. Furthermore, histochemical analyses of nasal turbinate tissue revealed Lf and Ly colocalization within the serous cells of submucosal glands, providing evidence that both proteins are strictly glandular products within the nasal mucosa. Therefore, both Lf and Ly are produced and secreted from the glands, and their secretion may be pharmacologically regulated in attempts to improve host defenses.\r"

Human and mouse insulin are secreted from the pancreatic islets of transgenic mice in response to normal physiological stimuli, such as glucose. Our data demonstrate that the transgenic mice have acquired tolerance to human insulin. The repertoire of T cells specific for exogenous antigens is shaped by the acquired tolerance to autologous proteins since pork but not beef or sheep insulin is also nonimmunogenic in the transgenic mice. We also found that the transgenic mice were tolerant to human proinsulin, the intracellular precursor of insulin. Unresponsiveness to human proinsulin most likely results from tolerance of insulin-specific and proinsulin-specific T cells that recognize the secreted enzymatic cleavage products of proinsulin, insulin and C-peptide.\r"

A subset of this population develops chronic liver disease. The reduction in plasma concentrations of alpha 1-AT results from a selective defect in secretion as the abnormal PiZ alpha 1-AT protein accumulates within the cell. It has recently been shown in several experimental systems that the heat shock/stress response, a response characterized by the synthesis of a family of highly evolutionarily conserved proteins during thermal or chemical stress, may also be activated by the presence of abnormal proteins within the cell. Therefore, we predicted that the heat shock/stress response would be induced in the absence of thermal or chemical stress in alpha 1-AT-synthesizing cells of PiZZ individuals. In the following study, however, we show that net synthesis of proteins in the heat shock/stress gene family (SP90, SP70, ubiquitin) is increased only in a subset of the population, PiZZ individuals with liver disease. It is not significantly increased in PiZZ individuals with emphysema or in those without apparent tissue injury. Net synthesis of stress proteins is not increased in individuals with another variant of the alpha 1-AT gene (PiS alpha 1-AT) and is not increased in individuals with severe liver disease but a normal alpha 1-AT haplotype (PiM alpha 1-AT). These results demonstrate that the synthesis of stress proteins is increased in a subset of individuals with homozygous PiZZ alpha 1-AT deficiency, those also having liver disease.\r"

This antigen was specifically recognized by all cytoplasmic-staining (C)-ANCA-positive sera from patients with Wegener's disease. C-ANCA antigen bound [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate, which indicates that it is a serine protease, but it could clearly be distinguished from the serine proteases elastase and cathepsin G. Stimulation of cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils with FMLP induced release of C-ANCA antigen. This indicates that in vivo C-ANCA might interact with the C-ANCA antigen after its release upon inflammatory stimulation. We further demonstrate that in some perinuclear staining (P-ANCA) patients' sera autoantibodies against other myeloid lysosomal enzymes can be detected, such as antimyeloperoxidase and antielastase. C-ANCA and P-ANCA thus represent a novel class of autoantibodies directed against myeloid lysosomal enzymes. The originally described Wegener-specific C-ANCA show an apparently uniform specificity for the 29,000 serine protease. In contrast, P-ANCA may recognize myeloperoxidase as well as elastase and/or other antigens.\r"

  ".W": "The role of hydrophobicity in the attachment of enteropathogens to gastrointestinal mucosa is controversial. In vitro binding of Escherichia coli RDEC-1 to rabbit intestine is dependent on the expression of pili. We examined in vitro adherence of piliated RDEC-1 after altering either the hydrophobicity of the organisms, the hydrophobicity of the substrate for attachment, or the surface tension of the suspending liquid. Hydrophobicity of RDEC-1 was determined using four complementary methods. In each assay piliated RDEC-1 demonstrated relatively more hydrophobic properties compared with both organisms grown to suppress pilus expression and a mutant that cannot express mannose-resistant pili. When piliated RDEC-1 were pretreated with tetramethyl urea to disrupt hydrophobic bonds surface hydrophobicity decreased. Concurrently, bacterial adherence to rabbit ileal microvillus membranes, mucus and mucin was reduced. Binding of piliated organisms to hydrophobic surfaces was significantly higher compared to both nonpiliated bacteria and the adherence of piliated RDEC-1 to relatively hydrophilic surfaces. Addition of propanol reduced the surface tension of the suspending liquid, and decreased adhesion of piliated RDEC-1 to polystyrene by 80%. Conversely, adherence of piliated organisms to a hydrophilic surface increased 12-fold after lowering the surface tension of the suspending liquid. We conclude that hydrophobic properties have a role in mediating in vitro adherence of this E. coli enteric pathogen.\r"

The expression of human high molecular weight B cell growth factor (HMW-BCGF) receptors (R) on clonal populations of leukemic B cells in CLL was studied by ligand binding assays using 125I-labeled HMW-BCGF as well as by immunofluorescence/flow cytometry and Scatchard analyses using an anti-HMW-BCGF R monoclonal antibody (MAb), designated BA-5. There was a high correlation between HMW-BCGF R expression and responsiveness to HMW-BCGF. 60% of CLL cases constitutively expressed HMW-BCGF R and showed a marked proliferative response to HMW-BCGF in [3H]TdR incorporation assays as well as colony assays. Similarly, HCL cells, PLL cells, and activated normal B cells expressed functional HMW-BCGF R, as determined by ligand binding assays using 125I-HMW-BCGF, [3H]TdR incorporation assays, and reactivity with BA-5 MAb. Scatchard analyses indicated the existence of approximately 3,000 HMW-BCGF R/cell on HMW-BCGF responsive CLL cells with an apparent Ka value of 4.6 X 10(7) M-1. The concentrations of HMW-BCGF required for maximum stimulation of CLL cells were two to three orders of magnitude lower than those needed for half maximal receptor occupancy, indicating that only a small fraction of HMW-BCGF R need to be occupied to stimulate leukemic CLL B cells. Crosslinking of surface bound 125I-HMW-BCGF (60 kD) with the bivalent crosslinker DTSSP to its binding site on fresh CLL cells identified a 150-kD HMW-BCGF/HMW-BCGF R complex, suggesting an apparent molecular weight of 90 kD for the receptor protein. The growth stimulatory effects of HMW-BCGF on clonogenic CLL cells did not depend on accessory cells or costimulant factors. The anti-HMW-BCGF R monoclonal antibody BA-5 disrupted HMW-BCGF/HMW-BCGF R interactions at the level of clonogenic CLL cells and inhibited HMW-BCGF-stimulated CLL colony formation in vitro. To our knowledge, this study represents the first detailed analysis of expression, function, and structure of HMW-BCGF R on B lineage CLL cells.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the relationship between transcapillary insulin transport and insulin action in vivo. During euglycemic clamps (n = 7) in normal conscious dogs we simultaneously measured plasma and thoracic duct lymph insulin and glucose utilization (Rd). Clamps consisted of an activation phase with constant insulin infusion (0.6 mU/kg per min) and a deactivation phase. [14C]Inulin was infused as a passively transported control substance. While [14C]inulin reached an equilibrium between plasma and lymph, steady-state (ss) plasma insulin was higher than lymph (P less than 0.05) and the ratio of 3:2 was maintained during basal, activation, and deactivation phases: 18 +/- 2 vs. 12 +/- 1, 51 +/- 2 vs. 32 +/- 1, and 18 +/- 3 vs. 13 +/- 1 microU/ml. In addition, it took longer for lymph insulin to reach ss than plasma insulin during activation and deactivation: 11 +/- 2 vs. 31 +/- 5 and 8 +/- 2 vs. 32 +/- 6 min (P less than 0.02). Rd increased from 2.6 +/- 0.1 to a ss of 6.6 +/- 0.4 mg/kg per min within 50 +/- 8 min. There was a remarkable similarity in the dynamics of insulin in lymph and Rd: the time to reach ss for Rd was not different from lymph insulin (P greater than 0.1), and the relative increases of the two measurements were similar, 164 +/- 45% and 189 +/- 29% (P greater than 0.05). While there was only a modest correlation (r = 0.78, P less than 0.01) between Rd and plasma insulin, the dynamic changes of lymph insulin and Rd showed a strong correlation (r = 0.95, P less than 0.01). The intimate relationship between lymph insulin and Rd suggests that the transcapillary insulin transport is primarily responsible for the delay in Rd. Thus, transcapillary transport may be rate limiting for insulin action, and if altered, it could be an important component of insulin resistance in obesity and diabetes mellitus.\r"

In the presence of 0.2 nM triiodothyronine and 0.5 microM insulin, up to 25% of the cells were able to undergo terminal adipose differentiation within 18 d, as assessed by lipid accumulation and the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activities. Addition of cortisol resulted in a potent dose-dependent stimulation of the adipose differentiation process. Cortisol could be replaced by dexamethasone and partly by aldosterone, but not by sex steroids. The proportion of differentiated cells was dependent upon the age of the donor; when isolated from young adults, up to 70% of the stromal-vascular cells expressed the adipocyte phenotype as compared with 5-10% when the cells were isolated from the oldest subjects. An inverse relationship was observed between the age of the 27 normal-weight donors and the extent of GPDH expression after maintenance of the cells for 18 d in chemically defined medium supplemented with insulin, triiodothyronine, and cortisol (r = -0.787, P less than 0.001). It is concluded that adult human adipose tissue still contains precursor cells that are able to undergo adipose differentiation in vitro. This improved culture system may offer the opportunity to characterize other adipogenic factors as well as antiadipogenic factors involved in the control of adipose tissue growth.\r"

  ".W": "Members of the erbA gene family are involved both in control of differentiation and in neoplasia. V-erbA, a retroviral oncogene, blocks avian erythroid differentiation. V-erbA-related transcripts are physiologically expressed in multiple normal tissues. They encode a family of transcriptional regulatory factors, some of which are thyroid hormone receptors. In man, two genes, erbA-alpha and erbA-beta, are transcriptionally active. We examined expression of erbA-related transcripts in normal and neoplastic colon. In normal colon mucosa, as well as in a colon polyp and in a colon polyp cell line, three characteristic erbA-related transcripts were consistently found. One transcript of 6 kb was erbA-beta related. Two transcripts of 2.7 and 5.2 kb were erbA-alpha related. In eight patients' colon carcinomas expression of the 6-kb erbA-beta transcript was absent or markedly diminished when compared with the same patients' noninvolved mucosa. In contrast, expression of the two erbA-alpha transcripts was the same in both colon carcinoma and noninvolved mucosa. No evidence was found of erbA-beta gene deletion in any of the tumors lacking erbA-beta expression. These data suggest that selective loss of normally present erbA-beta gene expression accompanies malignant transformation of the colonic epithelial cell.\r"

Corticosteroids apparently have been effective in some patients.\r"

Dermatologic changes may include hyperpigmentation, thickened skin, hypertrichosis, and papular angiomas. These changes are believed to result from humoral products of the plasma cell clone and frequently resolve with treatment of the neoplasm. We describe a man with typical POEMS syndrome with a unique skin lesion: a large, sharply circumscribed, pigmented plaque on the anterior chest wall centered over a plasmacytoma of the sternum. Results of histologic examination showed a proliferation of capillaries of varying size, enlarged fibroblasts, and increased amounts of collagen and proteoglycan from the dermis to the periosteum. Because the outer cortex of the sternum was eroded, peptide mediators of vascular and fibroblast proliferation may have diffused directly from the plasma cell lesion into the tissues of the chest wall.\r"

The variability in cardiovascular signals reflects the homeodynamic interplay between perturbations to cardiovascular function and the dynamic response of the cardiovascular regulatory systems. Modern signal processing techniques provide a means of analyzing beat to beat fluctuations in cardiovascular signals, so as to permit a quantitative, noninvasive or minimally invasive method of assessing closed loop hemodynamic regulation and cardiac electrical stability. This method promises to provide a new approach to the clinical diagnosis and management of alterations in cardiovascular regulation and stability.\r"

  ".W": "It has been shown that streptokinase administration at the time of acute myocardial infarction reduces mortality significantly, and that this reduction in mortality should be related to salvage of jeopardized myocardium and preservation of left ventricular function. To better define the relation between thrombolytic therapy and left ventricular modeling and function after acute myocardial infarction, 331 consecutive patients enrolled in the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Streptochinasi nell'Infarto Miocardico trial were studied by two-dimensional echocardiography just before discharge from the hospital. A 6 month follow-up examination was also available in 232 of these patients. Ventricular volumes were computed from an apical four chamber view, according to a previously published algorithm. An infarct size index was also semiquantitatively assessed, according to the number of akinetic and dyskinetic segments in an 11 segment left ventricular model. At predischarge examination, the 161 patients assigned to streptokinase treatment showed smaller ventricular volumes (end-diastolic volume 119.3 +/- 49.7 versus 134.5 +/- 57.8 ml [p = 0.011]; end-systolic volume 65.4 +/- 36.4 versus 74.9 +/- 45.7 ml [p = 0.036]) and smaller regional wall motion index (2.2 +/- 1.9 versus 2.7 +/- 1.9 segments; p = 0.019) compared with values in the 170 patients assigned to standard care; there was no difference in ejection fraction (46.6 +/- 14.1 versus 45.9 +/- 14.9%; p = 0.64). For both groups of patients, there was a significant relation between end-systolic volume and regional wall motion index (p less than 0.001); for large and similar extents of infarct size, ventricular volume was smaller in patients assigned to thrombolytic treatment than in patients assigned to standard care. At 6 months' follow-up, the differences in volume and regional dysfunction detected at the early examination persisted: 110.8 +/- 47.6 versus 127.9 +/- 53.8 ml for end-diastolic volume (p = 0.001), 56.3 +/- 33.6 versus 69.4 +/- 42.1 ml for end-systolic volume (p = 0.001) and 1.8 +/- 1.8 versus 2.3 +/- 1.8 segments for regional wall motion index (p = 0.001). Again, for comparable extents of infarct size, end-systolic volume was smaller in patients who received streptokinase (n = 110) than in those assigned to conventional treatment (n = 122). It is concluded that streptokinase improves left ventricular modeling and function in patients with myocardial infarction, reducing the extent of regional wall motion abnormalities and lessening postinfarction ventricular dilation. The beneficial effects persist up to 6 months.\r"

This study examined the hypothesis that, in humans, dilation of normal coronary arteries with increased flow limits increases in shear stress and that loss of flow-mediated dilation in atherosclerosis results in failure to control shear stress. Coronary blood flow was increased by infusing adenosine (0.022 to 2.2 mg/min) through a 2.5F Doppler flow catheter positioned in the middle segment of the left anterior descending coronary artery in 8 patients with mild atherosclerosis but no flow-limiting stenosis and in 10 patients with entirely smooth coronary arteries. Quantitative angiography and coronary flow velocity were used to estimate shear stress in a proximal segment of the left anterior descending artery exposed to increased flow, but not to adenosine. The peak increase in blood flow was the same in smooth (371 +/- 65%) and irregular (377 +/- 50%) arteries. However, at peak flow, dilation was greater in smooth segments (16.3 +/- 2.7%) than in irregular segments (2.0 +/- 1.5%) (p less than 0.001). In each patient, smooth segments dilated with increasing shear stress (slope 7.4 +/- 0.9%), whereas irregular segments dilated less (slope 0.9 +/- 0.6%) and showed greater increases in shear stress (p less than 0.01). The peak increase in shear stress was less in smooth (189 +/- 23%) than in irregular (365 +/- 52%) segments (p less than 0.01). These results suggest a control mechanism in normal coronary arteries whereby increases in shear stress stimulate vasodilation and thus limit further increases in this force at the endothelial surface.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Measurements of myocardial contrast (sonicated meglumine diatrizoate) intensity were compared with myocardial flow by radioactive microspheres before and after administration of dipyridamole (0.5 mg/kg body weight intravenously) in 10 open chest dogs with a critical stenosis in the left circumflex coronary artery. Computer measurements of contrast time-intensity curves corrected for background myocardial intensity were made along 12 transmural segments of the left ventricle at mid-papillary level and for the subendocardial and subepicardial half of each segment. After administration of dipyridamole, transmural flow in the control region increased significantly (p less than 0.001), resulting in a dipyridamole/baseline flow ratio (i.e., coronary reserve ratio) of 2.54 +/- 0.95. Similar changes (p less than 0.001) were seen by contrast echocardiography; the coronary reserve ratio was 2.10 +/- 0.60 with use of peak intensity and 3.48 +/- 1.58 with use of area under the time-intensity curve. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in myocardial flow, peak contrast intensity or area under the curve in the ischemic region after dipyridamole. In the control region the ratio of subendocardial to subepicardial flow was similar at baseline and after dipyridamole administration as assessed by microspheres (1.08 +/- 0.24 versus 1.17 +/- 0.25) or by area under the time-intensity curve (1.11 +/- 0.45 versus 1.11 +/- 0.56). In the ischemic region, the subendocardial/subepicardial flow ratio decreased significantly after dipyridamole administration as measured by microspheres (1.15 +/- 0.19 to 0.82 +/- 0.25; p less than 0.001) or by area under the curve (1.10 +/- 0.28 to 0.70 +/- 0.47; p less than 0.01). Thus, myocardial contrast echocardiography appears to be a sensitive technique with which to detect changes in myocardial flow induced by dipyridamole in the various myocardial layers of normal segments as well as of segments supplied by a critically stenotic coronary artery.\r"

  ".W": "Antigen activation of pulmonary mast cells causes mediator release and airway obstruction in allergic patients with asthma. Concomitant measurements of airway mediators and pulmonary function are technically difficult, even with bronchoalveolar lavage. Thus, a procedure was developed to evaluate further the relationship between mediator release, as measured by plasma histamine concentrations, and airway obstruction in patients with allergic rhinitis challenged with inhaled ragweed antigen. At an initial challenge, the cumulative antigen dose to decrease the FEV1 by approximately 20% was determined. Approximately 4 weeks later, the entire predetermined cumulative antigen dose to decrease the FEV1 by approximately 20% was administered in five consecutive inhalations with simultaneous monitoring of plasma histamine. We found the percent fall in FEV1 (24.3 +/- 2.3 versus 30.4 +/- 4.0; p greater than 0.05; n = 7) was similar whether antigen was administered by a cumulative or single-dose challenge. With the single-dose antigen challenge and monitoring blood samples frequently, we found plasma histamine (picograms per milliliter) values to increase from 73 +/- 17 to 1071 +/- 377 (p = 0.022) with peak value 5 minutes after challenge. Furthermore, we found that the intensity of airway obstruction to antigen corresponded to both the patient's baseline airway responsiveness to histamine and the absolute changes in plasma histamine after antigen challenge. Thus, the degree of airway obstruction to inhaled antigen is determined by both the intensity of the allergic reaction (as reflected by the plasma histamine value) and bronchial responsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the kinetics and pattern of allergenically induced mediator release in the human skin, we have studied 24 ragweed- and grass-allergic patients with a blister-chamber technique. Chambers sealed to the skin around a denuded area, formed by unroofing a blister, were challenged with 0.5 ml of either diluent or 10 or 100 times the concentration of allergen required for 4+ early intradermal reaction. Chamber fluids were removed hourly 1 to 8 hours after antigen challenge and examined for the presence of histamine, leukotriene C4 (LTC4), and prostaglandin D2 to compare inflammatory mediator levels with the clinical early response and late-phase response (LPR), as assessed by erythema around the chamber. An initial erythema developed rapidly and began to subside after 1 hour in all patients, but a late-phase local erythema and subcutaneous swelling around the chamber (i.e., greater than 2.5 cm, the outside diameter of the chamber) developed in 13/15 challenges only when the higher concentration of antigen was used. At both allergen concentrations, histamine levels peaked sharply at the first hour (20.6 +/- 2.3 ng/ml) and progressively declined during the next 4 hours by 75%, but remained above control levels for at least 7 hours. Despite high control values, LTC4 levels were significantly elevated (p less than 0.01) 4 to 6 hours after challenge. In visible reactions, maximal LPR around the chamber correlated with LTC4 levels obtained 6 and 7 hours after challenge (p less than 0.05). Prostaglandin D2 rose gradually in antigen-challenged chambers to a peak at 5 to 6 hours. Thus, early rises in histamine were temporally related to the immediate erythema, whereas the arachidonic acid metabolites from both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways that appeared in the skin after allergen challenge followed kinetics that corresponded to the time course of cutaneous LPR.\r"

Changes in symptom frequency and severity, FEV1, and peak expiratory flow rate were measured during a double-blind, double-dummy controlled, crossover protocol. The drugs proved equally effective, provided a sufficient dosage was administered. The dose required to eliminate recurrently disabling asthma relapses in these patients was about 2.0 mg of BUD per day or greater than 40 mg of PRED per day. On the average, BUD doses greater than or equal to 1.84 mg/day/70 kg adult (26.3 micrograms/kg/day) exhibited systemic effects on the 8 AM serum cortisol level and blood eosinophil count equivalent to greater than or equal to 15 mg of PRED per day. The latter doses are known to be associated with steroid-induced complications, such as osteoporosis. However, the level of systemic glucocorticoid activity produced by any particular dose of BUD in these patients was consistently much lower than that produced by the dose of PRED needed to achieve an equivalent level of antiasthmatic response. Thus, the use of high-dose inhaled BUD appears clinically reasonable and ethically acceptable in patients with severe asthma in whom the alternative is their continuing dependency on PRED.\r"

  ".W": "The measurement of bronchial hyperresponsiveness with inhaled aerosols is now accepted as an objective measurement of the severity of asthma. The most commonly used agents administered as aerosols are methacholine and histamine, which are believed to cause airways to narrow by contracting bronchial smooth muscle via specific receptors. Patients with asthma may also have an attack provoked by inhaling aerosols that increase or decrease the osmolarity of the fluid lining the airways. There is evidence to suggest that a change in the osmolarity of the airways causes the release of mediators from inflammatory cells in the airways. Thus, inhalational challenge with nonisotonic aerosols, such as water and hyperosmolar saline, may be useful to assess bronchial hyperresponsiveness to endogenously released mediators. Described in this article are some of the techniques used to challenge with nonisotonic aerosols, and airway responses are discussed in relation to responses obtained with other bronchial provocation tests. The mechanisms whereby these aerosols cause airways to narrow are considered, and the clinical implications of identifying responsiveness to these aerosols are discussed. Specific recommendations are made with respect to equipment, technique, and choice of aerosol.\r"

This condition has been observed most frequently in individuals participating in ultra-distance events but has also been reported in a marathon runner. Excessive water intake has been identified as a common etiological factor. Given that this is a serious condition but that the risks of impaired performance and heat injury from inadequate water ingestion are substantial, how likely is it that hyponatremia will develop in events of marathon duration or shorter? A review of fluid and electrolyte balance--and an example of expected sodium and fluid losses in a marathon runner--suggest that normal regulatory mechanisms should prevent its occurrence in the absence of other contributing factors. Accordingly, ingestion of adequate fluid should remain a priority for individuals engaged in endurance activity.\r"

It has been suggested that eating may affect blood pressure homeostasis through an insulin-induced blunting of baroreflex sensitivity. We investigated the effects of oral glucose loading on baroreflex sensitivity in young normotensives and in elderly normo-and hypertensive subjects. Blood pressure was measured by a new noninvasive device, Finapres, which measures blood pressure continuously in the finger. Baroreflex sensitivity was estimated with the phenylephrine and nitroglycerin method. In both elderly groups mean arterial pressure fell significantly after the glucose load (11 +/- 1 mm Hg, P less than .001 in the hypertensives, and 8 +/- 2 mm Hg, P less than .01 in the normotensive subjects), whereas no change in blood pressure was found in the young group. Baroreflex sensitivity was lower in both elderly groups than in young normotensives. Glucose loading had no influence on baroreflex sensitivity in the three groups. Therefore, we conclude that other factors are involved in the phenomenon of postprandial hypotension in the elderly.\r"

These result in depressing whole body metabolism, growth, body temperature and blood glucose levels, heart rate and vital capacity, gene expression, etc., but delaying aging of tissues, suppressing development of pathology and tumors, and, in underfed rats, prolonging life span. The anti-aging effects of hormones are demonstrated by elevating hormone levels in old rats whose hormones have declined as a result of dysfunctions that develop in the neuroendocrine system with age. An increase of hormones in these rats promotes gene expression, elevates protein synthesis, and enhances metabolism, growth, and function of stimulated organs and tissues.\r"

Both age and hypertension impair baroreflex sensitivity and decrease compliance of the heart and vasculature. These changes increase the risk of hypotensive responses to activities that reduce cardiac preload and to conditions that produce tachycardia or eliminate atrial contraction. Common clinical examples include orthostatic and postprandial hypotension, nitrate intolerance, and atrial fibrillation. The increased intra- and interindividual variability in blood pressure, resulting from impaired homeostatic capacity, challenges established diagnostic criteria for hyper- and hypotensive syndromes and necessitates new multivariate approaches to research data analysis. Gerontologic investigations utilizing blood pressure measurements should examine individual as well as group responses, and stratify subjects by level of basal blood pressure to isolate the effect of aging from the effects of blood pressure elevation.\r"

This instrument detects changes in red blood cell velocity (LDV) in flow-active vessels and the volume of red blood cells flowing through these vessels (LDO). With the forearm in a 30 degrees C water bath there were no significant between-group differences in LDV or LDO. Elevating bath temperature to 35 degrees C elicited a significant increase in LDO in all three groups, but LDV did not significantly change. Increasing temperature to 40 degrees C elicited significant increases in both LDO and LDV with the former being of greater magnitude. At this temperature LDV values in both the middle-aged and older groups were significantly lower than those of the young subjects. Expressing the data during heating as percent change from 30 degrees C showed a significantly lower volume (LDO) response in the older group at 35 and 40 degrees C and a significantly lower LDV response at 40 degrees C for both the middle-aged and older subjects in comparison to the young group. It is concluded that aging decreases the response of cutaneous blood flow in the forearm to the direct effects of heat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Over the past few years there has been a rapid increase in our knowledge of genetic mechanisms of cancer initiation and propagation. In view of these advances, a reevaluation of the links between aging and cancer appears appropriate. This article attempts such a reevaluation and concludes that there is indeed much evidence indicating common causes of cancer and aging. This conclusion is primarily based on the positive correlation between aging rate of different species with their cancer rate and that both cancer and aging may be initiated and propagated by impairments of gene regulation driven by destabilizing processes affecting regulatory elements. Reduction of cancer incidence and aging rate would then be based on enhancing common mechanism acting to maintain proper gene regulation of differentiated cells.\r"

  ".W": "The theory of aging which proposes that DNA repair capacity declines with age and/or DNA damage accumulates with age, resulting in increasingly aberrant gene expression, is attractive but still unproven. Most results that do not support the theory are at least neutral. We propose that much of the ambiguity produced by work so far is due to (a) the difficulty of controlling all relevant variables, including particularly the proliferation state of the cells used and the location and nature of the damage being repaired, and (b) the existence of multiple and overlapping DNA repair pathways. A better knowledge of the critical, rate-limiting events in DNA repair in vivo, and the application of more sophisticated approaches for studying these events, may ultimately resolve the ambiguities. The causal relationship between DNA damage and cancer seems more secure. Declining DNA repair capacity with age would be expected to accelerate the increased incidence of cancer with age, but it is not known how important this is compared to other genetic and environmental variables. Results with genetic diseases generally support this view. Diseases characterized by DNA repair deficiencies are accompanied by phenomena that are also characteristic of normal aging, but a causal relationship has not been established. However, some of these diseases do constitute a strong risk factor for cancer. Even less convincing is a causal link between DNA repair deficiencies and aging in the so-called premature aging syndromes.\r"

The receptor systems are largely unchanged with age, although some subtle modifications do occur. Furthermore, many of the early growth factor initiated events occur in a similar way in both young and old cells. This has led us to theorize that senescent cells are not arrested like mitogen-deprived young cells. Rather, they become blocked at a new arrest point in late G1 just prior to entry into DNA synthesis.\r"

  ".U": "90038240\r", 
  ".W": "Profound changes in the biology of cancer occur as people and experimental animals age. Many naturally occurring tumors in humans and experimental animals show slower growth with advancing age and longer host survival. The most likely cause for this alteration in tumor biology is the universal phenomenon of cellular immunesenescence. At the onset of sexual maturation, the thymus begins to involute. With this involution, a progressive decline is observed in T-cell functions, e.g., lymphokine production, response to mitogens, and response to antigenic stimulation. It has been proposed that the immune system plays an important role in the stimulation of tumor growth. This role in poorly antigenic tumors may overshadow the role of the immune system as a tumor suppressor. It has been shown that poorly antigenic murine tumors grow more slowly in immune deficient or aged mice. Human tumors are generally poorly antigenic and many (such as lung, breast, and colon carcinomas) also show decreased growth rates in older adults. This article describes age-related changes in the immune system and discusses the theories of immune enhancement of tumor growth. Consideration is also given to the explanation of increased incidence of cancer in elderly patients and the potential role of the immune system in this phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "A chronic 30-50% restriction of dietary energy intake (but without malnutrition) typically and strongly lowers the incidence of most spontaneous and induced tumors, delays their onsets, and extends maximum life span in rodents. When compared to normally fed controls, animals fed these dietary restriction (DR) regimens show decreased rates of change for most (but not all) age-sensitive biologic indexes studied to date. DR's impact on chemically induced tumors appears to depend more on energy than on fat restriction, and result from less promotion (and not less initiation). The molecular and cellular events underlying these various outcomes of DR are unclear. Viable explanations include less cellular oxidative damage, a retardation in the age-related changes in the immune system, hormonal changes, less exposure to dietary carcinogens and promoters, less energy for tumor growth, less carcinogen activation, and better DNA repair. New findings are consistent with the notion that DR reduces cellular damage mediated by active oxygen. A lower production or higher detoxification rate of active oxygen species, which damages molecules and promotes tumor growth, could explain DR's effects on aging and tumors.\r"

A series of four double-blind randomized studies are reviewed, reporting the effects of different dose regimens of roxatidine acetate compared with ranitidine and placebo in healthy volunteers using continuous intragastric pH monitoring. These pharmacodynamic studies clearly demonstrate that roxatidine acetate is an effective gastric antisecretory agent, which is up to twice as potent as ranitidine. The results of several clinical studies of roxatidine acetate in patients with gastric as well as duodenal ulcer conducted in Europe, Japan, and the United States are also reviewed. These studies show that roxatidine acetate is comparable to other potent H2-receptor antagonists in terms of cumulative healing rates, pain relief, and safety. Overall, the pharmacodynamic and clinical data indicate that the efficacy of roxatidine acetate 75 mg twice-daily (b.i.d.) does not differ significantly from ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. Roxatidine acetate is equally effective in the treatment of peptic disease including gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, and reflux esophagitis.\r"

Analysis of the data now available does not allow the validation of the theoretical parameters currently thought to influence compliance: psychological factors, disease factors, and treatment factors. Nevertheless, it seems, from a review of the studies, that despite the imperfect methodology commonly used, the variations in treatment regimens do not play an important role in patient compliance. This impression needs to be confirmed by new, specific prospective studies.\r"

Therapy should be directed at permanent eradication of the organism. Eradication should only be diagnosed when no C. pylori organisms are demonstrable several weeks after the end of any therapy. The eradication rate with monotherapy is rather low. Combining colloidal bismuth subcitrate with an antibiotic improves the results. At present, triple therapy with colloidal bismuth subcitrate, amoxycillin or tetracycline, and metronidazole or tinidazole results in an eradication rate of over 80%. Bismuth seems to be essential in preventing antibiotic resistance formation.\r"

In addition, it reports on the findings of interaction studies with food and other drugs. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of roxatidine were found to be nearly identical for different doses, formulations, and ethnic groups. The decrease in relative total clearance (oral clearance) in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly can be explained almost completely by their level of renal function. As expected from the pharmacokinetic characteristics in healthy volunteers, only a small amount of roxatidine is removed by hemodialysis. Dose reduction is recommended in patients with renal impairment, but dose supplementation after hemodialysis is not necessary. Only a negligible fraction of the dose administered is excreted with breast milk. No pharmacokinetic interactions were found with theophylline, warfarin, propranolol, diazepam, and desmethyldiazepam, antipyrine or antacids. Food did not interfere with the absorption or disposition of roxatidine.\r"

Only 8 of 300 HLA-Cw3-specific CTL clones tested could selectively lyse HLA-Cw3-transfected cells in an H-2-unrestricted manner, all having been isolated after hyperimmunization of double transgenic mice. These clones also lysed HLA-Cw3+ human cells. Unexpectedly, the lysis of the human but not that of the murine HLA-Cw3 cells was inhibited by Ly-2,3-specific mAb. Despite significant expression of HLA-B7 class I molecules on transgenic lymphoid cells, including thymic cells, limiting dilution analysis and comparative study of TCR-alpha and -beta gene rearrangements of the eight isolated clones (which suggested that they all derived from the same CTL precursor) indicated that the frequency of HLA-Cw3-specific H-2 unrestricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes remained low (even in HLA-B7 x human beta 2-microglobulin double transgenic mice). This suggests that coexpression of HLA class I H and L chain in transgenic mice is not the only requirement for significant positive selection of HLA class I-restricted cytotoxic mouse T lymphocytes.\r"

We now demonstrate that differences in LFA-1 cell surface density are responsible for the variable adhesion efficiency of lymphocyte subsets to EC. Electrophoretic analysis revealed multiple glycosylated isoforms of both alpha and beta subunits, largely as a result of different degrees of sialylation, with variable expression among different lymphocyte subsets. Neuraminidase digestion before EC adhesion increased the binding efficiency of all lymphocyte subsets, although the relative increase in each subset was proportional to the initial LFA-1 sialic acid content. LFA-1 cross-linking resulted in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and a rise in [Ca2+]i when using anti-alpha but not anti-beta subunit antibodies. These findings indicate that the density of LFA-1 on lymphocyte subsets controls their adhesive properties, and that the LFA-1 alpha subunit has transmembrane signaling properties that may result in activation events after interaction with its natural ligands.\r"

This immune response is almost completely defective in infancy. Because of this the development of cellular compartments in the human spleen was studied immunohistologically in frozen and paraffin tissue sections of 32 infant spleens (less than 2 y of age) and 6 spleens from children. Six cases of sudden infant death syndrome and 7 cases of infection or sepsis which were included showed no significant differences compared to the other cases. Whereas all other cellular compartments have completed their maturation to an adult-type immunophenotype and morphology within the first 5 mo, the infant marginal zone B cells show essentially different features compared to the adult situation. The main characteristics of the infant marginal zone B cells are the absence of CD21-(C3d/EBV-R) expression and the high percentage of cells strongly coexpressing IgM and IgD. As the marginal zone is supposed to be the site of the initiation of the immune response to polysaccharide Ag, there is a remarkable coincidence between the first appearance of MZ B cells with adult features, and the time of acquisition of the ability to mount an immune response to polysaccharides, including encapsulated bacteria.\r"

T cell chemotaxis in response to IL-2 and to lymphocyte chemotactic factor (LCF) was markedly suppressed by the addition of TS1/18. TS1/22 was a less effective inhibitor than TS1/18 with only LCF stimulated responses showing significant inhibition when compared in seven different T cell preparations. Neither TS1/18 nor TS1/22 antibody inhibited random T cell migration. Control mAb to CD4 T cells failed to inhibit T cell random migration or chemotaxis. Additional studies to evaluate the adherence and migration of T cells through IL-1-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers showed that both TS1/22 and TS1/18 suppressed T cell migration through HUVEC, but failed to inhibit adherence of T cells to these cells. These studies indicate that LFA-1 plays a role in the migration of T cells through HUVEC and in the in vitro chemotactic response of T lymphocytes to IL-2 and LCF.\r"

Three major polypeptide fragments of 16 kDa, 22 kDa, and a triplet of 26- to 29-kDa bound IgG. They were localized to three separate regions of the molecule by Western blot analysis using antisera to specific regions of the Fn molecule, by amino acid sequencing, and by their previously described heparin binding affinities. The 22-kDa fragment interacted with IgG under physiologic conditions and it is localized at the N-terminal of the Fn molecule. The 16-kDa and 26- to 29-kDa fragments bound to IgG under conditions of lower ionic strength; the former commences at residue 588, carboxyl-terminal to the collagen binding region and the latter begins at residue 1597, carboxyl-terminal to the cell binding domain.

  ".U": "90038488\r", 
  ".W": "The CD11/18 (LFA-1, Mac-1) molecules participate in neutrophil adhesion to cultured endothelium in vitro and are critical for effective neutrophil localization into inflamed tissues in vivo. More recently, the MEL-14 Ag, which was first defined as a lymphocyte homing receptor, has also been implicated in inflammatory neutrophil extravasation. Here we compare the regulation and function of these adhesion molecules on neutrophils during the in vivo inflammatory response. The MEL-14 Ag is expressed at high levels on bone marrow and peripheral blood neutrophils, but is lost on neutrophils isolated from the thioglycollate-inflamed peritoneal cavity. In contrast, Mac-1 is up-regulated on inflammatory neutrophils and little change is seen in the level of LFA-1 expression. In vitro activation of bone marrow neutrophils with PMA or leukotriene B4 results in a dose dependent increase in Mac-1 and decrease in MEL-14 Ag expression within 1 h after treatment, thus reflecting what is found during inflammation in vivo. Neutrophils activated in vitro or in vivo (MEL-14Low, Mac-1Hi) do not home to inflammatory sites in vivo, correlating with the loss of the MEL-14 Ag and the increased Mac-1 expression. Anti-LFA-1, anti-Mac-1, or MEL-14 antibody given i.v. suppress neutrophil accumulation within the inflamed peritoneum (38%, 30%, and 37% of medium control, respectively) without affecting the levels of circulating neutrophils. However, when FITC-labeled cells are precoated with the mAb and injected i.v., only MEL-14 inhibits extravasation into the inflamed peritoneum (25% of medium control). Finally, in ex vivo adhesion assays of neutrophil binding to high endothelial venules in inflamed-lymph node frozen sections MEL-14 inhibits greater than 90%. anti-LFA-1 20 to 30% and anti-Mac-1 less than 10% of the binding of bone marrow neutrophils to inflamed-lymph node high endothelial venules. These results confirm that both the MEL-14 antigen and Mac-1/LFA-1 are important in neutrophil localization to inflamed sites in vivo, but suggest that their roles in endothelial cell interactions are distinct.\r"

Purified IgA anti-III mAb enhanced phagocytosis of type III GBS by rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro by fourfold compared with phagocytosis of buffer-treated GBS. In the absence of antibody, neonatal rat serum did not promote phagocytosis, but addition of neonatal rat serum to GBS opsonized with IgA anti-III led to a sevenfold increase in phagocytosis. Heat inactivation of C destroyed the ability of neonatal rat serum to enhance phagocytosis in the presence of IgA. C3 deposition was observed when GBS coated with IgA anti-III mAb were incubated in untreated neonatal rat serum or in serum treated with Mg/EGTA. This latter observation suggested that C3 deposition occurred through activation of the alternative pathway. The control IgA mAb MOPC 315 did not enhance GBS ingestion or C3 deposition on GBS. Depletion of C in vivo by using cobra venom factor abolished the protective effect of IgA anti-III mAb in the neonatal rat model. These data suggest that the ability of this IgA to activate C further enhances its opsonic activity and may be essential for its protective effect in vivo.\r"

The agglutinating patterns of both mAb with a panel of stationary phase of yeast cells of standard strains did not match those of any known polyclonal antibody (PAb) factors. The reactive patterns of both mAb for a given panel of 202 isolates of seven Candida species and the mode of competitive binding between mAb and a PAb factor, as determined by a combination of direct and indirect immunofluorescence staining, demonstrated that the two mAb were a part of PAb factor 4 (a prescribed reactive pattern of adsorbed PAb) but were different from each other in their specificity. The thereby designated mAb 4b and 4c were tested under PAb factor 4-positive Candida strains and further division into two to three serotypes of each species were made. 1H-Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (500 MHz) of purified neutral mannans from strains of each serotype showed that although the 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of mannans from two subtypes of C. albicans serotype A and from each of two serotypes of Candida guilliermondii and Candida glabrata were identical or similar, the two mAb were still able to distinguish their fine determinant structures. Our findings suggest that mAb with entirely identical specificity cannot be produced against even the same determinant groups of mannan. In addition, the fact that microheterogeneity may occur without limit in the mannans of the strains suggests that antibodies with unlimited diverse specificities are produced directed against these antigenic varieties as well.\r"

  ".W": "Mouse phagocytic glycoprotein-1 (Pgp-1; Ly-24) is a 95-kDa glycoprotein of unknown function that has served as an important T cell/leukocyte differentiation marker. Recent work has suggested that it may be related to a human 85- to 95-kDa glycoprotein (termed variously the Hermes Ag/lymphocyte homing receptor, ECMRIII, P80, and CD44) that is involved in lymphocyte binding to high endothelial venules in the process of lymphocyte homing, and has been implicated in other cell adhesion events. The widespread expression of this molecular class in diverse organ systems suggests a broad role in cellular adhesion, and has led to the unifying designation homing-cellular adhesion molecule (H-CAM). By using human H-CAM cDNA probes, we have isolated a full-length cDNA for the mouse homolog. Comparison of the human and mouse sequences reveals that an N-terminal domain homologous to cartilage proteoglycan core and link proteins, as well as the C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic sequences, are highly conserved (89% and 86% identity, respectively). In contrast, a proximal extracellular domain thought to serve as a target for O-glycosylation and chondroitin sulfate attachment has undergone substantial divergence (only 42% identity). Transient expression of the cDNA in CHO cells followed by immunologic staining confirms that this mouse H-CAM cDNA encodes Pgp-1.1, one of two known Pgp-1 alloantigens.\r"

These cells have been characterized previously by their granular morphology and expression of CD11b but not CD28. Whereas multiple CD28+/CD4+ alloproliferative cloned cell lines generated by culture at limiting dilution immediately after isolation from peripheral blood each had a unique TCR-beta gene rearrangement, 19 of 21 CD11b+/CD4+ clones showed identical TCR-beta, and gamma gene rearrangements. In conventional MLR, the CD11b+/CD4+ cells responded poorly after stimulation with some HLA-class II Ag, and staining with a TCR Id-specific antibody and DNA blot hybridization suggested that the responding CD11b+/CD4+ cells typically contained predominant clonal populations. Clones of CD11b+/CD4+ cells with different TCR gene rearrangements showed closely similar patterns of responses when stimulated by a panel of allogeneic PBMC, but the response pattern did not correspond to that of any known HLA-class II Ag. These findings indicate that CD11b+/CD4+ cells have a limited alloproliferative repertoire characterized by predominant recognition of a limited number of undefined determinants that appear to be expressed in association with multiple distinct HLA-class II Ag. Our results suggest that CD11b+/CD4+ cells are selected for clonal reactivity by processes distinct from those for CD28+/CD4+ cells.\r"

Primary CTL and CTL clones were cultured in dishes coated with anti-CD3 Ab or in medium containing PMA (5 nM) and assayed for Ag-specific or Ag-nonspecific \"redirected\" cytolysis using FcR+ P815 cells as targets. Cytotoxic activity of bulk CTL and five of six CTL clones tested in this study were inhibited by prolonged (longer than 6 h) pretreatment with immobilized anti-CD3 Ab or PMA, whereas proliferation of CTL clones or expression of surface CD3 molecules were not. The intracellular granule enzyme (N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester esterase) activity of CTL clones was not reduced under these suppressive conditions, indicating that the incompetence of CTL is not merely due to depletion of cytolytic granules by chronic stimulation. The suppressed cytotoxicity could be recovered by culturing CTL without perturbation of CD3 molecules for 24 h. In one exceptional clone, BM10-37, pretreatment with immobilized anti-CD3 Ab or PMA did not suppress the cytotoxic activity. Immunostaining of intracellular protein kinase C (PKC) revealed that PKC was depleted after prolonged treatment with immobilized anti-CD3 Ab or PMA in those susceptible CTL clones but not in the resistant BM10-37. These findings lead us to conclude that prolonged stimulation of CD3 of CTL results in depletion of PKC and that PKC may be essential for signal transduction to deliver a lethal hit to the target cells.\r"

At regular intervals, groups of mice were tested for a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to the purified protein derivative (PPD) of tubercle bacilli, and the course of infection was monitored by measuring the size of the infected footpad, enlargement of the draining lymph node, and the number of bacteria in the spleen and lymph node. In both strains the DTH response to PPD was significantly delayed in UV-treated mice compared to unirradiated mice, when tested 21 and 42 days after BCG infection. By day 50, no significant difference was detected in the DTH response between irradiated and unirradiated mice. UV treatment reduced the size of the lymph node draining the site of BCG infection in both strains of mice and the size of the infected footpad in C3H mice but not in BALB/c mice. In both strains of mice the total number of bacteria in the spleen and the draining lymph node increased after UV irradiation. When irradiated 3, 5, 18, or 21 days after BCG infection, BALB/c mice also showed a significant decrease in their DTH response to PPD, indicating that the UV-induced suppression of BCG occurs both at the induction and the elicitation stages of the immune response. Thus, mice exposed to a single dose of UV radiation either before or after BCG infection showed an impaired DTH response to mycobacteria, which was accompanied by an increase in the multiplication of bacteria in the tissues, even though the organisms were introduced at an unirradiated site. These studies demonstrate that a systemic effect of UV irradiation can interfere with the development and expression of immunity to pathogenic bacteria in mice.\r"

  ".U": "90038517\r", 
  ".W": "ART-18, a mouse IgG1 mAb recognizing the IL-2 binding domain of the rat p55 subunit IL-2R molecule, prevents graft rejection in various experimental models, although its mechanism of action in vivo, like that of anti-IL-2R mAb generally, remains elusive. These studies were designed to define whether IL-2R+ T effector cells were actually eliminated or their function merely inhibited by comparing directly the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of intact ART-18 and its F(ab)/F(ab')2 fragments. Addition of each mAb preparation profoundly suppressed MLR set up between naive LEW responders and x-radiated BN stimulators, suggesting that mAb fragments retained Ag binding functions in vitro. However, both ART-18 F(ab) and F(ab')2 were ineffectual in vivo as judged by their inability to affect acute (8 days) rejection of (LEW X BN)F1 cardiac allografts in LEW recipients (graft survival ca. 11 and 9 days, respectively, compared to ca. 21 days after therapy with intact ART-18, p less than 0.001). The sera levels of ART-18 and ART-18 F(ab')2 were 4 to 5 micrograms/ml, but only less than 0.5 micrograms/ml of F(ab) could be detected. The therapeutic failure of ART-18 fragments was unrelated to potential host sensitization, as rat antimouse F(ab) or F(ab')2 serum IgG titers remained in the same range as those against intact ART-18. The role of the Fc portion of Ig in the mode of action of ART-18 was then tested further by flow microfluorimetry analysis of host mononuclear spleen cells and immunoperoxidase stains of the graft infiltrate. IL-2R+ cells were abundant in rats treated with ART-18 fragments, comparable to acutely rejecting controls. In contrast, IL-2R expression was abolished in animals undergoing ART-18 therapy. The elimination of IL-2R+ cells is required to prolong cardiac allograft survival in rats after IL-2R targeted treatment with ART-18 mAb.\r"

Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled IL-6R with these antibodies showed that the Mr of a mature IL-6R was 80 kDa and its value was reduced to 50K after treatment with O- and N-glycanase and neuraminidase, indicating that IL-6R is a glycoprotein. Two mAb recognizing different epitopes were prepared. One, PM1 inhibited the binding of 125I-IL-6 to the receptor and blocked the IL-6-dependent growth of a T lymphoma line, KT3. PM1 could not bind to IL-6R when it was saturated with IL-6, indicating that this antibody recognizes the IL-6 binding or the adjacent site on IL-6R. The other, MT18 was not inhibited by IL-6 for its recognition of IL-6R, therefore, this could be used for cytofluorometric staining of normal cells. Nonstimulated B cells expressed undetectable amount of IL-6R regardless of the expression of surface IgD. However, after the stimulation with PWM, IL-6R was observed on IgD- B cells with a relatively large size, but subtly on IgD- small B cells and not on IgD+ B cells, fitting the function of IL-6 which acts on activated B cells to induce Ig production. In contrast, IL-6R was detected on non-stimulated CD4+/CD8- and CD4-/CD8+ T cells. The level of IL-6R on both T cell subpopulations was not significantly changed after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of monoclonal human Ig that occur in association with lymphoproliferative diseases has provided valuable information about antibody structure and idiotypes. We analyzed 940 human sera that contained monoclonal IgM proteins for their ability to bind to four carbohydrate epitopes. Ten sera bound asialo-GM1, five of these sera also bound GM1, 10 bound to 3-fucosyllactosamine (3-FL), and one each bound to levan and galactan. Although the antibody activity in each serum was associated with a single L chain isotype, both kappa and lambda isotypes were represented among the proteins that bound to asialo-GM1 and to 3-FL. Some antibodies against asialo-GM1 were highly specific for this compound, whereas others cross-reacted with the structurally related gangliosides GM1 and GD1b. The antibodies to asialo-GM1 also varied considerably in their ability to lyse liposomes that contain asialo GM1. An association of IgM mAb against gangliosides with peripheral neuropathies has been reported recently, but only one of five patients whose antibodies reacted with GM1 ganglioside had a neuropathy. The antibodies that bound 3-FL exhibited narrower specificity, and less than 10% cross reactivity was noted with structurally related carbohydrates. The frequency of monoclonal proteins that bound 3-FL and asialo-GM1, approximately 1:100 sera for each specificity, was surprisingly high in view of the fact that both of these epitopes are expressed in human tissues. We suggest that these antibodies may be poly-specific and/or that the subset of B lymphocytes that synthesizes these anti-carbohydrate antibodies undergoes malignant transformation more frequently than other B lymphocytes.\r"

In the present work it was demonstrated that alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) and kininogen, two proteinase inhibitors of human plasma, bound to protein G, whereas 23 other human proteins showed no affinity. alpha 2M was found to interact with the IgG-binding domains of protein G, and in excess alpha 2M inhibited IgG binding and vice versa. A synthetic peptide, corresponding to one of the homologous IgG-binding domains of protein G, blocked binding of protein G to alpha 2M. Protein G showed affinity for both native and proteinase complexed alpha 2M but did not bind to the reduced form of alpha 2M, or to the C-terminal domain of the protein known to interact with alpha 2M receptors on macrophages. Binding of protein G to alpha 2M and kininogen did not interfere with their inhibitory activity on proteinases, and the interaction between protein G and the two proteinase inhibitors was not due to proteolytic activity of protein G. The finding that protein G has affinity for proteinase inhibitors was generalized to comprise also other Ig binding bacterial proteins. Thus, alpha 2M and kininogen, were shown to bind both protein A of Staphylococcus aureus and protein L of Peptococcus magnus. The results described above suggest that Ig-binding proteins are involved in proteolytic events, which adds a new and perhaps functional aspect to these molecules.\r"

  ".W": "Human peripheral blood monocytes contain human leukocyte elastase (HLE) and cathepsin G (CG), serine proteinases originally described in azurophil granules of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). Immunoreactive HLE and CG of freshly harvested monocytes have been quantified in this study; to begin to elucidate potential roles for these enzymes in extracellular events, release in response to stimuli has been measured, along with proteolytic activity of monocytes toward surface-bound proteins. Our results indicate that whole-cell extracts of monocytes contain approximately 6% of the amount of HLE as do extracts of comparable numbers of PMN. In response to PMA in vitro, monocytes released 39 to 53% of their content of HLE and CG within 60 min, a fractional release greater than that of PMN. Furthermore, when phorbol-stimulated monocytes were adherent to a fibronectin-coated surface, extensive HLE-mediated proteolysis of the surface-bound protein was observed. Proteolysis by such cells in the presence of proteinase inhibitors was of considerable interest, since a subpopulation (15 to 20% of the total) expressed marked but localized proteolytic activity, possibly escaping inhibition through contact-mediated mechanisms. These data indicate that a subpopulation of freshly harvested monocytes is rich in HLE and CG (serine proteinases traditionally associated with PMN), can promptly release HLE and CG in response to stimuli, and can utilize HLE for extracellular proteolysis. Monocyte-derived serine proteinases may participate in extracellular events formerly associated with PMN-derived HLE and CG.\r"

Maximum association of 125I-labeled CRP with neutrophils and 125I-labeled CRP degradation during association with these cells was achieved by stimulating the neutrophils with PMA at 10 ng/ml; a concentration in which azurophil granule release was not significant. For PMA-stimulated neutrophils, the association of 125I-labeled CRP was 1.8 times higher and PMA-stimulated neutrophil-mediated degradation of the ligand was three times faster than that for nonstimulated cells. The neutrophil-associated 125I-labeled CRP in the absence and presence of PMA proved on SDS-PAGE analysis to be approximately 50% degraded. There was a positive correlation between the extent of CRP degradation and the association of 125I-labeled CRP with neutrophils. In addition to generation of neutrophil associated CRP intermediates, small soluble CRP peptides were generated during association of CRP with neutrophils. These peptides inhibited superoxide production from opsonized zymosan-activated neutrophils by approximately 40% at 10 micrograms/ml. 125I-labeled CRP degradation mediated by nonstimulated neutrophils, and neutrophil-conditioned medium (from both non-stimulated and PMA-stimulated cells) was inhibitable by alpha 1-antitrypsin and approximately seven times less at 1 h than that occurring during 125I-labeled CRP-association with PMA-stimulated neutrophils. The degradation of 125I-labeled CRP mediated by PMA-stimulated neutrophils was not fully inhibitable by alpha 1-antitrypsin. The data point to the involvement of a membrane-associated serine protease, which is maximally activated by PMA, in the degradation of 125I-labeled CRP during association with neutrophils. Our results indicate that at an inflammatory site CRP-derived peptides can be produced that inhibit the action of activated neutrophils.\r"

We have investigated the effects of LPS from Bacteroides fragilis, an organism documented to have little toxicity in vivo, on the induction of this property in human endothelial cells. Monolayers of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE) exhibited no increase in adhesiveness for 51Cr-radiolabeled PMN after 4 h of exposure to B. fragilis LPS from 1 ng to 10 micrograms/ml. Escherichia coli LPS elicited a dose-dependent enhancement of HUVE adhesiveness for PMN over the same concentration range, reaching a maximum of 49.4 +/- 6.6% at 10 micrograms/ml. Like E. coli LPS, B. fragilis LPS converted chromogenic substrate in the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay, and was directly cytotoxic to bovine aortic endothelial cells. Both B. fragilis LPS activities required doses two-to-three log-fold higher than for E. coli LPS. In addition, we found that B. fragilis LPS inhibited the induction of HUVE adhesiveness for PMN by E. coli LPS. This inhibition was also dose-dependent, becoming maximal (greater than 80%) when B. fragilis LPS was in 10- to 20-fold excess. Tumor necrosis factor and IL-1, two monokines which also elicit HUVE adhesiveness for PMN, were not inhibited by B. fragilis LPS, suggesting a mechanism of HUVE activation by LPS which is signal-specific, and which recognizes specificities of LPS structure.\r"

These antibodies were then assayed by a suspension ELISA for reactivity with up to 20 heterologous smooth or rough isolates of gram-negative bacteria, which were assayed after heat or formalin treatment, or as live cells. Extracted LPS from the same bacteria were tested for reactivity with the MAbs by direct ELISA. The MAbs demonstrated broad cross-reactivity with most heat-treated bacteria. In contrast, cross-reactivity of the MAbs with live or formalin-treated bacteria was limited almost exclusively to E. coli J5, Hemophilus species, or rough mutants of Salmonella minnesota. Reactivity with extracted LPSs and lipid A varied considerably depending on the MAb. Further, when Western blotting was used as the assay only four of eight MAbs reacted with J5 LPS, and none of the MAbs reacted with LPS from smooth S. minnesota or any of its rough mutants. Adsorption of the MAbs with acid hydrolyzed, boiled, or live E. coli J5 prior to ELISA of the MAbs with J5 LPS supported evidence that none of the MAbs were specific for lipid A and that reactivity was greater with boiled than with live cells. Thus, the cross-reactivity of antibodies to E. coli J5 LPS is dependent on the physical state of the bacteria or LPS used for assay, the assay used, and the specificity of the antibody.\r"

However, the risk factors for sporadic cases have not been clearly delineated. Study data were collected by using a self-administered dietary and historical questionnaire on all patients whose history included bloody diarrhea and who attended one of the participating emergency departments. Designation as \"case\" or \"control\" occurred after stool culture results were known, eliminating the possibility for recall bias common to this type of study. Cases (E. coli O157:H7-positive) were further matched with one diarrheal and one healthy community control, and more detailed information on food preparation practices and other data were then taken. Of 266 presentations of bloody diarrhea, 103 (38.7%) were due to E. coli O157:H7. Unmatched analyses with bloody diarrheal controls revealed a seemingly lower risk for E. coli O157:H7 infection in fast food restaurant patrons. No increased risk could be detected for ground meat consumption despite adequate study power, although an association between ingestion of undercooked meat and infection (odds ratio = 3.5, P less than .05) was found when community controls were used. Proper food cooking (and handling) rather than the avoidance of particular food products is the preventive measure of choice.\r"

Although control of initial infections is usually successful with current regimens, relapse is common if lifelong prophylactic or suppressive therapy is not used. This is true in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, and cytomegaloviral infection. Because Drs. Joseph A. Kovacs and Henry Masur of the National Institutes of Health have been instrumental in developing strategies for the management of P. carinii pneumonia, they were asked to discuss their current approach to chemoprophylaxis of this infection in this AIDS Commentary.\r"

Three of the new-generation antibiotics were compared with established agents by using animal models of urinary tract infection. Of the antibiotics tested, gentamicin and ceftriaxone alone were capable of eradicating infection from acute and chronically infected kidney tissue. Chronic lower urinary tract infection was best managed by using norfloxacin or ceftriaxone. Gentamicin, aztreonam, cotrimoxazole and ampicillin were much less effective. In subacute pyelonephritis, gentamicin, aztreonam, norfloxacin and ceftriaxone successfully eliminated microorganisms from most of the infected kidneys, whereas ampicillin and cotrimoxazole had little effect on bacterial numbers. The data have provided an experimental basis for the selection of antibiotics in the management of persistent urinary tract infection.\r"

Blood glucose was not significantly different in septic rats, but lactate, pyruvate, and alanine were markedly increased. Conversely, blood ketone body concentrations were markedly decreased in septic rats. Both plasma insulin and glucagon were markedly elevated in septic rats. The maximal activities of glucose 6-phosphatase, fructose 1,6-biphosphatase, pyruvate carboxylase, and phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase were decreased in livers obtained from septic rats suggesting a diminished hepatic gluconeogenesis. Hepatic concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, and other gluconeogenic intermediates were markedly increased in septic rats, whereas those of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and acetyl-CoA were decreased. The rate of gluconeogenesis from added lactate, pyruvate, alanine, and glutamine was decreased in isolated incubated hepatocytes from septic rats. It is concluded that the diminished capacity of hepatic gluconeogenesis of septic rats could be the result of changes in the maximal activities or regulation of key nonequilibrium gluconeogenic enzymes or both but do not exclude other factors (e.g., toxins).\r"

Seventeen patients showed at least one supraventricular premature complex (SVPC) on the 24-h ECG recording when receiving salbutamol alone: eight patients had isolated SVPCs, less than 10/h; five patients had greater than or equal to 10 SVPCs/h; eight patients showed runs of supraventricular tachycardia or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Seventeen patients also had at least one ventricular premature complex: seven patients had less than 10 isolated PVCs/h, five patients greater than or equal to 10 PVCs/h; eight patients had paired or multifocal PVCs and one patient a run of ventricular tachycardia. The addition of oral theophylline at an average dose of 600 mg in the evening (blood concentrations showed a mean maximum of 13.4 +/- 4.0 (SD) and minimum of 5.5 +/- 2.9 mg/l) had no influence on the frequency or severity of either ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias. Thus, cardiac arrhythmias are very common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and concomitant heart disease, but oral theophylline added to a regimen of salbutamol does not seem to affect the occurrence or severity of arrhythmias.\r"

Following antithyroid treatment of euthyroidism, serum beta 2-microglobulin decreased significantly in both Graves' disease (162 nmol l-1) and toxic adenomas (175 nmol l-1); values which were not significantly different from that of the control group. The level of serum beta 2-microglobulin in 12 patients with hypothyroidism was not different from that of the control group. However, in untreated hypothyroidism serum beta 2-microglobulin was positively correlated with serum thyroxine (T4) (rho = 0.69; P less than 0.05) and free thyroxine index (FT4I) (rho = 0.72; P less than 0.02). It is concluded that elevated levels of serum beta 2-microglobulin may reflect the increased metabolism in patients with thyrotoxicosis. Increased levels in active Graves' disease may also partly be caused by immunological activation.\r"

From week 13 to week 20 nine patients in the simvastatin group and all patients in the cholestyramine group were treated with the combination of the two drugs. From week 21 to week 52 all patients were on monotherapy with simvastatin. Simvastatin treatment reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 40% after 12 weeks, compared with 33% in the cholestyramine group. This difference was not significant. The total reductions of LDL-cholesterol on combination therapy were respectively 60% and 56% in each group. After 52 weeks LDL-cholesterol was still reduced by 36% (P less than 0.001) on monotherapy with simvastatin. Simvastatin also reduced triglycerides (TG) by 17% (P less than 0.05) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was increased by 19% (P less than 0.01).

During hospitalization, the combined incidence of cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial infarction on-treatment (withdrawals not included) was significantly lower (P less than 0.02) in the 100 mg group (7.1%) than in both the 1000 mg group (20.8%) and the placebo group (19.7%). During later time periods of treatment and at all time periods analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle (withdrawals included), data suggested the same trend, but differences were not statistically significant. Collagen-induced platelet aggregation and serum thromboxane B2 were reduced to the same degree in the two ASA groups and were normal in the placebo group. The data suggest that low-dose ASA could be cheap and safe as first-aid therapy in myocardial infarction suspects.\r"

We studied the effects of insulin pulsing (10 i.v. pulses of human insulin of 0.035 U kg-1 idealised body weight were given, each of 20 s duration, with intervals of 6 min, three times per day covered with adequate administration of glucose) on 2 successive days on glucose-tolerance in nine well-controlled Type 1 diabetic patients on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy (age 26 (7) years, mean (SD); duration of diabetes 10 (7) years; body mass index 23.4 (2.3) kg m-2; HbA1c 6.0 (0.6)%). On the days before and after the insulin pulsing, the patients were subjected to metabolic assessments by an oral glucose tolerance test (1 g glucose kg-1 body weight) 30 min after the subcutaneous injection of 0.15 U kg-1 body weight regular human insulin and a subsequent bicycle-ergometer test. During these metabolic assessments, plasma free insulin concentrations, plasma glucagon and the non-protein respiratory quotient remained unaffected by the insulin pulsing. However, glucose tolerance deteriorated significantly (maximal glucose concentration 120 min after glucose load was 10.0 mmol l-1 before and 13.9 mmol l-1 after insulin pulsing, P less than 0.01). In conclusion, the pattern of insulin pulsing used in this study did not ameliorate oral glucose homeostasis in well-controlled Type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetic patients.\r"

The effect was evaluated with a standardized exercise test and radionuclide angiocardiography with determination of global and regional ejection fraction. At rest xamoterol caused no significant changes among the angina patients while global and regional ejection fraction increased among the cardiomyopathy patients. During exercise, when the drug exerts a beta 1-antagonist effect, xamoterol increased the exercise performance among the angina pectoris patients. Fourteen out of 19 patients with angina pectoris were unable to increase their ejection fraction from rest to work due to coronary ischaemia. These 14 patients improved their global ejection fraction during work after xamoterol treatment.\r"

The optimal combination of measurements differs for clinical and epidemiological assessment. Clinically, the major problem is to distinguish true iron deficiency from other causes of iron-deficient erythropoiesis, such as the anaemia of chronic disease. Epidemiologically, techniques that provide quantified estimates of body iron are preferable. For both purposes, the serum ferritin is the focal point of the laboratory detection of iron deficiency. Serum ferritin measurements provide a reliable index of body iron stores in healthy individuals, a cost-effective method of screening for iron deficiency, and a useful alternative to bone marrow examinations in the evaluation of anaemic patients. Preliminary studies indicate that measurement of the serum transferrin receptor may be the most reliable way to assess deficits in tissue iron supply.\r"

  ".W": "To prevent nutritional iron deficiency, sufficient iron must be absorbed from the diet to meet the normal physiological requirements. Daily iron losses in males are about 1 mg (14 micrograms kg-1), while the average additional requirements incurred in women include menstruation (0.6 mg), pregnancy (2.7 mg) and lactation (less than 0.3 mg). Requirements during pregnancy are not evenly distributed and increase to between 5-6 mg in the last trimester of pregnancy, which is more than can be absorbed from even an optimal diet. While the amounts absorbed are affected by the iron content of the diet, the composition of the latter is even more relevant. About one-quarter of the iron in haem proteins is absorbed regardless of the other components in the diet, while non-haem iron absorption is subject to the interplay of promoting and inhibiting substances in the diet. Thus diets rich in enhancers of non-haem iron absorption, chiefly meat and/or ascorbic acid, have high iron bioavailability (about 3 mg d-1) while diets in which inhibitors, such as polyphenols and phytates, predominate are poor sources of iron (less than 1 mg d-1). Examination of the relative proportions of promoters and inhibitors of iron absorption in individual foodstuffs and the measured iron absorption from them may be useful in predicting the overall iron bioavailability from mixed diets.\r"

In iron-deficient infants and children, there is convincing evidence of impaired psychomotor development and cognitive performance. Finally, iron-deficient women during the childbearing years (and iron-deficient men) have a decreased work capacity and less efficient response to exercise. These symptoms provide ample justification for preventing and treating a common and easily correctable nutritional disorder.\r"

It is important for the physician to recognize age-related changes in sleep and obtain an accurate history. The correction of environmental disruptions and transient psycho-physiologic problems, the critical evaluation of drug use, and the treatment of underlying medical conditions are important first steps in addressing the complaint of insomnia. Appropriate sleep hygiene and pharmacologic therapy can be helpful in many instances. The family physician, however, must remember that primary sleep disorders are more common in the elderly, and sleep-center referral should be considered if such a disturbance is suspected or if problems persist after conservative therapy.\r"

Over 20 million people are covered by the various state Medicaid programs and most states maintain detailed computerized records of all reimbursed health care encounters on a recipient-specific basis. For states covering medication costs, data on drug exposures are particularly complete and accurate. However, Medicaid claims data also have many limitations that can pose major methodological difficulties. Foremost among these is the uneven validity and completeness of the diagnoses appearing on claims. Likewise, the unique identification of specific program participants is not straightforward, although useful approaches can often be developed to track individuals over time. Consideration of the limitations as well as the possible strengths of claims-based data makes it possible to choose appropriate study hypotheses as well as to attempt solutions, where possible, to the biases of this methodology.\r"

  ".W": "Although the important influence of a woman's reproductive history on her risk of breast cancer is widely recognized, it is not clear whether this is wholly accounted for by the age at her first full-term pregnancy, or whether there are additional, independent influences of breastfeeding or number of children. To examine the respective contributions to the risk of breast cancer of these reproductive factors, we used logistic regression methods to analyze data from a multicenter case-control study, the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study. Included in the analysis were 4599 women, 20-55 years of age, identified as having an initial diagnosis of breast cancer by one of eight collaborating population-based cancer registries. The 4536 controls were women of similar ages selected by random dialing of households with telephones in the same eight areas. As expected, age at first full-term pregnancy exerted a strong influence on the risk of breast cancer. However, after it and other potentially confounding factors had been controlled for, parity and duration of breastfeeding also had a strong influence on the risk of breast cancer. Compared with women of parity one, women of parity seven or greater had an adjusted relative risk of breast cancer of 0.59 (95% CL, 0.44-0.79). Compared with parous women who never breastfed, women who had breastfed for 25 months or more had an adjusted relative risk of 0.67 (0.52-0.85). These results do not support the supposed preeminent importance of age at first full-term pregnancy among the reproductive determinants of breast carcinogenesis. Resolution of this issue may have important implications for elucidating hormonal influences on breast cancer and for projecting future trends in the disease.\r"

The meta-analytically corrected sensitivities and specificities resulted in significant improvement in the discriminatory power of the Bayes model.

A placebo controlled double-blind evaluation of an experimental antihypertensive agent was conducted. Of 30 patients entered, 21 were admitted to the active drug phase of the protocol on the basis of a clinic supine diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mmHg; 9 subjects with lower levels of diastolic blood pressure were dropped. Noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed during the placebo period. Comparison of the two subgroups demonstrated similar levels of 24 hour blood pressure (142 +/- 13/86 +/- 7 vs 137 +/- 10/82 +/- 10). Analysis of individual patient data showed that 24 hour mean diastolic blood pressure was apparently normal (less than or equal to 80 mmHg) in 5/21 (24%) \"admitted\" and 3/9 (33%) \"dropped\" subjects. Circadian blood pressure pattern were similar in the two subgroups.

These are called external and internal stage shifts, respectively. At each stage the extent of the external and internal shifts and any associated mortality benefits are estimated. Further, the model allows the interrelationships of these benefits within and between stages to be delineated. This then allows us to better understand the results of the RCT.

The clinical relationship between central nervous system activity, hormone secretion, and vital signs has not to our knowledge been previously reported. We used computerized electroencephalographic (CEEG) analysis to monitor 5 nondiabetic subjects during acute insulin-induced hypoglycemia (0.75 U/kg intravenous push). Their glucose nadir was 38 +/- 6 mg/dl (mean +/- 1 SD). A three-phase pattern of change in CEEG power in response to hypoglycemia was observed: phase 1 was characterized by an increase in total CEEG power (natural log of activity = 9.1 +/- 1.3 microV2) over baseline (8.7 +/- 1.2 microV2) in the theta, delta, and beta frequency bands. This phase preceded and coincided with the glucose nadir. During phase 2, power in all frequency bands fell significantly below baseline. A nadir in CEEG power (8.0 +/- 1.6 microV2) occurred 40 to 55 minutes after insulin injection as glucose levels were rising. During phase 3 there was a return to baseline in CEEG power and frequency spectra. Heart rate increase just before phase 1; peak heart rate (91 +/- 8 beats/min) coincided with peak CEEG power and was significantly higher than basal rate (71 +/- 11, P less than 0.05). A significant increase in respiratory rate occurred during phase 1 of the CEEG and persisted through phase 2. A significant decrease in mean blood pressure (nadir = 73 +/- 6 mm Hg) below preinsulin blood pressure (81 +/- 8 mm Hg, P less than 0.05) coincided with the nadir of CEEG power in phase 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Five triplicate measurements for each method were made at intervals of 30 minutes in each of 9 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated goats. Cardiac output ranged between 0.68 and 3.79 L/min. The 45 data points yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.948 for the comparison of D2O indicator dilution cardiac output measurements with thermodilution measurements and a linear regression slope of 1.046. D2O indicator dilution measurements were biased by -0.11 +/- 0.22 L/min compared with thermodilution measurements and had a standard deviation of +/- 0.12 L/min for triplicate measurements. Hematocrits ranging between 20 and 50 vol% had no effect on optical density for D2O. D2O is more stable than indocyanine green and approximately one-tenth the price (40 cents per injection compared with $4). The basic instrumentation cost of approximately $9,000 is an additional initial expense, but provides the ability to perform pulmonary extravascular water measurements with a double-indicator dilution technique. D2O has potential as a tracer for the clinical determination of indicator dilution cardiac output measurements and pulmonary extravascular water measurements.\r"

  ".W": "During the last decade, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) has studied a series of combination chemotherapy regimens in metastatic (stage IV) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In January 1984, the ECOG activated a randomized study, EST 1583, which concluded the evaluation of combination regimens in phase III trials and initiated the evaluation of single agents exclusively in previously untreated patients. The treatment regimens in EST 1583 consisted of: (1) mitomycin, vinblastine, and cisplatin (MVP); (2) vinblastine and cisplatin (VP); (3) MVP alternating with the regimen cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and procarbazine (CAMP); (4) carboplatin followed by the MVP regimen at the time of progression; and (5) iproplatin followed by MVP at the time of progression. From January 1984 to July 1985, 743 patients were entered on this trial and 699 fulfilled the eligibility requirements. The following objective response rates (complete plus partial remissions) were observed: first-line MVP, 20%; VP, 13%; MVP/CAMP, 13%; carboplatin, 9%; iproplatin, 6%; and second-line MVP, 6%. First-line MVP produced a significantly higher response rate than the other treatments (P = .03) adjusted for prognostic variables. Using analyses that were adjusted for prognostic covariates, survival for patients treated on a given regimen was compared with survival for all remaining patients. These analyses showed that treatment with carboplatin was associated with longer survival (median survival time, 31.7 weeks; P = .008) while initial treatment with MVP was associated with a trend for shorter survival (median survival time, 22.7 weeks; P = .09). It should be noted that none of these regimens appear to have produced a clinically meaningful prolongation of survival. Similar analyses evaluating time to progression disclosed that carboplatin-treated patients had a significantly longer time to progression (median time to progression, 29 weeks) than all remaining patients (P = .01). Life-threatening and lethal toxicities (toxicity grades 4 and 5) were greater on the combination regimens than on the single agents (P less than .0001). Based on these results, current group-wide ECOG trials in stage IV NSCLC consist of randomized phase II trials evaluating single agents.\r"

Patients with liver-only metastases (N = 143) were randomized, 76 to the IV arm and 67 to the IA arm, and 115 patients (65 IV, 50 IA) were fully evaluable. Of the 65 patients in the IV arm, 28 crossed over to IA treatment after failing IV FUDR. The dose-limiting toxicity of IV FUDR was diarrhea, whereas biliary toxicity limited both the dose and duration of IA FUDR therapy. Of the first 25 patients treated with IA FUDR at a dose of .3 mg/kg/day, 10 developed radiographically evident biliary strictures, and three developed permanent jaundice. With reduction of the initial IA FUDR dose to .2 mg/kg/day, and adoption of a policy of early dosage reduction, treatment interruption, or termination of therapy for persistent elevations in alkaline phosphatase, only two further cases of serious biliary toxicity occurred. However, 26 of the 50 IA FUDR patients ultimately had therapy terminated because of drug toxicity rather than disease progression. When compared with systemic infusion, infusion into the hepatic artery greatly enhanced the antitumor activity of FUDR against colorectal liver metastases. Although biliary toxicity is the most serious limitation of this form of therapy, biliary stricture and jaundice usually can be averted through careful monitoring of liver enzymes and early dosage reduction.\r"

The majority of patients had leiomyosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma although two patients with sarcomas of osseous origin were included. Doxorubicin was administered at a dosage of 60 mg/m2 by continuous push and ifosfamide 5.0 g/m2 by continuous infusion over 24 hours with mesna (7.5 g2 over 36 hours) with courses repeated every 3 weeks until progression, toxicity cumulative doxorubicin dosage of 450 mg/m2. Overall, 15 (36%) patients demonstrated objective remissions including three complete and 12 partial remissions (95% confidence limits, 21.5% to 52.0%). The median duration of remission was 7.0 months and the median survival time for all eligible patients was 8.0 months. Toxicity was predominantly hematologic with the median leukocyte nadir being 1,300 per microliter of blood and documented sepsis in six patients. These data support activity for ifosfamide plus doxorubicin in patients with advanced sarcoma, but the actual contribution of ifosfamide needs to be evaluated through prospective randomized trials which are currently underway.\r"

All patients received a minimum of two courses of carboplatin as part of the North Thames Cooperative Group trial. With a minimum follow-up of 6 months, 37 patients (69%) have clinical evidence of progressive disease and 28 have died. The absolute prechemotherapy level of CA-125 was of no value in predicting which patients would develop progressive disease. However, the change in CA-125 levels from before chemotherapy to 1 month later, after one course of carboplatin, could be used to divide patients into different prognostic groups. The best discrimination was found by dividing the patients into those who showed a greater than sevenfold decrease in CA-125 levels and those who showed a smaller change. Eight of 14 (58%) patients with a greater than sevenfold decrease in CA-125 levels remain disease-free compared with three of 36 (9%) patients with a lesser fall (P = .0005). The change in CA-125 levels during the first month of chemotherapy may indicate which patients should be offered alternative or symptomatic therapy and which should continue with the currently available toxic chemotherapy.\r"

Twenty-four patients with cancers for which no standard regimens were likely to be effective received repeated courses of a combination of cisplatin (150 mg/m2), etoposide (1,500 mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (5,000 mg/m2) at doses for which bone marrow transplantation is usually used. A total of 10 patients received escalating doses of recombinant human granulocyte CSF (rhG-CSF); 11 patients receiving identical chemotherapy and supportive therapy without rhG-CSF served as controls for the first cycle of therapy. Five of these patients and 3 additional patients also served as their own controls, receiving rhG-CSF for all cycles after the first. No patient received bone marrow transplantation. rhG-CSF shortened the median duration of severe granulocytopenia (less than or equal to 100/mm3) in a dose-related fashion (P less than .03; Kruskal-Wallis test). Patients not receiving rhG-CSF had a median of 8.5 days of granulocytopenia. Those receiving 40 micrograms/kg of rhG-CSF for approximately 20 days from the third day after chemotherapy had a median of 7.0 days (P less than .23) and those receiving 60 micrograms/kg had a median of 5.5 days (P less than .007) of granulocytopenia. An rhG-CSF dose of 20 micrograms/kg had no effect. Recovery to a granulocyte count of at least 500/mm3 took a median of 12 days in the control group and 8 days (P less than .03) in patients receiving rhG-CSF at a dose of 60 mg/kg. The duration of antibiotic therapy (a median, 9.0 days v 5.0 days) was shortened with the two higher and effective doses of rhG-CSF compared with control patients. The duration of hospitalization (median of 20 days v 19 days) was not shortened. These findings that rhG-CSF decreases the risk of granulocytopenia associated with this particular dose-intensive chemotherapy regimen therapy administered without bone marrow transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Despite treatment, emesis remains a major problem with cisplatin (CDDP) chemotherapy. Reasons for variability in antiemetic response among patients and in subsequent cycles are largely unknown and toxicity is sometimes severe. We have, therefore, carried out a multicenter, double-blind randomized trial comparing a combination of high-dose metoclopramide (MTC) (1 mg/kg x 4) and methylprednisolone (P) (treatment A) with a shorter but higher single-dose schedule of metoclopramide (3 mg/kg x 2) combined with dexamethasone (DEX) and diphenhydramine (DIP) to prevent extrapyramidal reactions (treatment B). Three hundred sixty-seven consecutive patients treated with various chemotherapy combinations containing CDDP were studied. Complete protection from vomiting/nausea was, at first cycle, 72.5%/79.5% with treatment B and 55.8%/65.1% with treatment A, a statistically significant difference (P less than .002/P less than .005). In subsequent cycles, protection from emesis significantly decreased with no difference between the two treatments. Multifactorial analysis shows that women, younger patients, outpatients, and patients who experienced emesis in previous cycles were at higher risk of suffering nausea and/or vomiting. Both regimens were well tolerated, but patients treated with treatment B had significantly less extrapyramidal reactions (1.7%/6.1%, P = .053). Treatment B is preferred due to its greater efficacy and lower incidence of extrapyramidal reactions. Trials on antiemetic therapy should take into account the important variables able to influence the efficacy of treatment. There is still a need for improving prevention of emesis in CDDP-treated patients.\r"

  ".W": "Continuous long-term 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (floxuridine; FUDR) infusion frequently causes severe and dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxicity when administered at a constant rate at commonly prescribed dose levels. In preclinical studies, a circadian infusion pattern peaking late in the daily activity phase was better tolerated and had superior antitumor activity than a constant infusion against a transplanted tumor. Based upon these data and upon other chronobiological cytokinetic and pharmacologic considerations, we compared a circadian patterned variable rate infusion with a maximal flow rate in the late afternoon/early evening and minimum flow rate during the early morning hours to a constant rate infusion in 54 patients with widespread cancer. All FUDR infusions were administered using an implanted drug pump. In a pilot crossover study and a second randomized trial, patients with metastatic malignancies treated with equal dose intensities experienced less frequent and less severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting following variable rate infusion. In a third study, the dose intensity of variable rate infusion was escalated stepwise to determine the maximum-tolerated dose. Patients receiving time-modified FUDR infusion tolerated an average of 1.45-fold more drug per unit time while evincing minimal toxicity. FUDR infusion was found to have activity against progressive metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC). Increased dose intensity achieved by optimal circadian shaping may improve the therapeutic index of infusional FUDR and may help control malignancies that are refractory to conventional chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "A dosage formula has been derived from a retrospective analysis of carboplatin pharmacokinetics in 18 patients with pretreatment glomerular filtration rates (GFR) in the range of 33 to 136 mL/min. Carboplatin plasma clearance was linearly related to GFR (r = 0.85, P less than .00001) and rearrangements of the equation describing the correlation gave the dosage formula dose (mg) = target area under the free carboplatin plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) x (1.2 x GFR + 20). In a prospective clinical and pharmacokinetic study the formula was used to determine the dose required to treat 31 patients (GFR range, 33 to 135 mL/min) with 40 courses of carboplatin. The target AUC was escalated from 3 to 8 mg carboplatin/mL/min. Over this AUC range the formula accurately predicted the observed AUC (observed/predicted ratio 1.24 +/- 0.11, r = 0.886) and using these additional data, the formula was refined. Dose (mg) = target AUC x (GFR + 25) is now the recommended formula. AUC values of 4 to 6 and 6 to 8 mg/mL. min gave rise to manageable hematological toxicity in previously treated and untreated patients, respectively, and hence target AUC values of 5 and 7 mg/mL min are recommended for single-agent carboplatin in these patient groups. Pharmacokinetic modeling demonstrated that the formula was reasonably accurate regardless of whether a one- or two-compartment model most accurately described carboplatin pharmacokinetics, assuming that body size did not influence nonrenal clearance. The validity of this assumption was demonstrated in 13 patients where no correlation between surface area and nonrenal clearance was found (r = .31, P = .30). Therefore, the formula provides a simple and consistent method of determining carboplatin dose in adults. Since the measure of carboplatin exposure in the formula is AUC, and not toxicity, it will not be influenced by previous or concurrent myelosuppressive therapy or supportive measures. The formula is therefore applicable to combination and high-dose studies as well as conventional single-agent therapy, although the target AUC for carboplatin will need to be redefined for combination chemotherapy.\r"

Sixteen patients with neurosurgical problems were admitted during the first year of the hospital's existence. In the first year of Harvey Cushing's staff appointment, 38 neurosurgical patients were admitted. Infection, trauma, and trigeminal neuralgia were the most common neurosurgical problems at that time. When Harvey Cushing retired in 1912, his practice had grown to 100 operations per year. By the end of Walter Dandy's tenure, the surgical volume was much larger, more than 500 major operations per year. The development of neurosurgery virtually can be mirrored in the practice of neurosurgery under Harvey Cushing and Walter Dandy. From its humble beginnings in the treatment of trauma and infection, neurosurgery has expanded to cover all forms of intracranial disease, virtually every aspect of spinal disease, vascular disease (both intracranial and extracranial), and peripheral nerve injury. The centennial celebration at Johns Hopkins may be considered a centennial for neurosurgery. As we reflect upon our foundations, it is worthwhile to ask what changes we will contribute to the further development of neurosurgery in the next century.\r"

  ".U": "90039522\r", 
  ".W": "Intracranial compliance, as estimated from a computerized frequency analysis of the intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform, was continuously monitored during the acute postinjury phase in 55 head-injured patients. In previous studies, the high-frequency centroid (HFC), which was defined as the power-weighted average frequency within the 4- to 15-Hz band of the ICP power density spectrum, was found to inversely correlate with the pressure-volume index (PVI). An HFC of 6.5 to 7.0 Hz was normal, while an increase in the HFC to 9.0 Hz coincided with a reduction in the PVI to 13 ml and indicated exhaustion of intracranial volume-buffering capacity. The mean HFC for individual patients in the present study ranged from 6.8 to 9.0 Hz, and the length of time that the HFC was greater than 9.0 Hz ranged from 0 to 104.8 hours. The mortality rate increased concomitantly with the mean HFC, from 7% when the mean HFC was less than 7.5 Hz to 46% when the mean HFC was 8.5 Hz or greater. The length of time that the HFC was 9.0 Hz or greater was also associated with an increased mortality rate, which ranged from 16% if the HFC was never above 9.0 Hz to 60% if the HFC was 9.0 Hz or greater for more than 12 hours. In 12 patients who developed uncontrollable intracranial hypertension or clinical signs of tentorial herniation during the monitoring period, 75% were observed to have had an increase in the HFC to 9.0 Hz or more 1 to 36 hours prior to the clinical decompensation. The more rapid the increase in the HFC, the more likely the deterioration was to be caused by an intracranial hematoma. Continuous monitoring of intracranial compliance by computerized analysis of the ICP waveform may provide an earlier warning of neurological decompensation than ICP per se and, unlike PVI, does not require volumetric manipulation of intracranial volume.\r"

Sixteen patients were operated on for the first time (Group B), and in this group the volume estimates were comparable (intraoperative ultrasound findings 101.69% +/- 24.65% of CT findings). The difference between the means was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Ultrasonography improved intraoperative delineation of tumor margins, as depicted by CT, thus maximizing the extent of resection; however, with recurrent tumors, intraoperative ultrasound tended to overestimate the tumor volume. Gliosis may account for this difference.\r"

Those who use cocaine must be considered at risk of cardiotoxicity at any time after recent cocaine ingestion. Guidelines are suggested for clinical management in oral and maxillofacial surgery.\r"

  ".U": "90039833\r", 
  ".W": "Tobacco has caused the greatest epidemic of the twentieth century, which is beginning to wane in the United States, but is still growing in much of the world. The epidemic developed as a result of innovations in the tobacco industry and larger cultural changes over the 75 years prior to the introduction of Camel cigarettes in 1913. Factors that set the stage for the epidemic include the development of flue-cured and Burley tobaccos, the mechanization of cigarette production with its consequent concentration of capital in a few companies, the safety match, efficient transportation systems, and innovative advertising. Between 1913 and 1963, the cigarette industry experienced almost unbroken growth in the United States. However, since the early 1950s, increasing evidence that cigarettes cause lung cancer and other diseases has dictated that product innovation concentrate on the appearance of safety. In the late 1960s and for a sustained period since 1973, cigarette consumption has declined in the United States, but in the developing world the epidemic curve of cigarette use is still on the upswing. As tobacco use declines in the United States, it is crucial that the production of tobacco products as well as their consumption be reduced. Otherwise, attempting to control the problem in the United States will not result in a net reduction in mortality around the world.\r"

  ".W": "Nicotine dependence in alcohol-involved adults is a long-ignored treatment problem. The absence of its discussion in the literature is difficult to defend in light of medical and epidemiological data on the cost and prevalence of this dual addiction. Most descriptive studies of alcohol abusers published in the past 20 years have reported tobacco use rates of at least 90%. There is a crucial need to educate treatment professionals and their clients about the additional health risks associated with joint nicotine dependence and alcoholism. Historically, certain barriers to active intervention have existed in drug abuse treatment facilities, including (1) concerns that urging clients to quit smoking might have an adverse effect on their maintenance of sobriety, (2) a tendency to minimize the strength and severity of nicotine addiction, (3) a lack of informative data on how best to treat smoking in recovering alcoholics, and (4) financial issues related to marketing and insurance compensation. Recent data obtained from recovering alcoholics who have tried to quit smoking and anecdotal reports from alcoholism treatment centers that have begun addressing nicotine addiction are now challenging these barriers. Education, role modeling, environmental control, and development of staff expertise can be incorporated into standard alcoholism treatment programs to jointly treat these paired addictions.\r"

Affect regulation refers to any attempt to alleviate negative mood states by means of pharmacologic-, cognitive-, behavioral- or environmental-change methods. The psychological construct/process of affect regulation is examined in relation to (1) the initiation, development, and maintenance of the cigarette smoking habit; (2) the process of quitting smoking; and (3) the long-term maintenance of smoking abstinence versus relapse. Various psychosocial factors and physiological mechanisms are explored that have been hypothesized to be links between negative mood states, nicotine addiction, and smoking cessation. Implications for smoking cessation treatment are discussed in the areas of (1) the use of pharmacologic agents, such as clonidine, in the reduction of nicotine withdrawal symptoms; (2) nicotine replacement therapy; and (3) skills-training approaches to smoking cessation and relapse prevention.\r"

This article addresses the need to expand and create a new methodology for smoking cessation to suit these patients. Interventions geared toward a tertiary level of treatment are offered. This article also examines treatment within the context of phase-specific interventions.\r"

A unique approach to nicotine detoxification has been developed at the Haight Ashbury Free Clinics' Drug Detoxification, Rehabilitation and Aftercare Project. After an evaluation by a physician, a thorough explanation of the treatment plan, and if the patient is interested, a combination of clonidine via the transdermal patch (Catapres-TTS) and of nicotine replacement via nicotine polacrilex (Nicorette) is used. By combining a Nicorette taper with clonidine, the physician can control the rate of nicotine withdrawal (Nicorette) and the extent to which withdrawal symptoms are treated (clonidine). This appears to be an effective, comfortable method for detoxification from cigarettes and nicotine. Its use should prove helpful as an adjunct to a comprehensive smoking cessation program.\r"
